ITEM 1 – BUSINESS

BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

We are one of the largest
diversified financial services companies in the United States, operating businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management, and global fund processing services. We operate directly and through numerous
subsidiaries, providing many of our products and services nationally and others in our primary geographic markets in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Ohio, Kentucky and the greater Washington, D.C. area. We also provide certain asset management
and global fund processing services internationally. At December 31, 2005, our consolidated total assets, deposits and shareholders’ equity were $92.0 billion, $60.3 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively.

We were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1983 with the consolidation of Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National
Corporation. Since 1983, we have diversified our geographical presence, business mix and product capabilities through internal growth and strategic bank and non-bank acquisitions and the formation of various non-banking subsidiaries.

We include information on significant recent acquisitions and a planned transaction in Note 2 Acquisitions and Note 26 Subsequent Event in the Notes To Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and here by reference.

LINES

OF

BUSINESS

In addition to the following information relating to our lines of business, we incorporate information under the captions Line of Business Highlights, Product Revenue, Cross-Border Leases
and Related Tax and Accounting Matters, Aircraft and Vehicle Leasing Businesses, and Business Segments Review in Item 7 of this Report here by reference. Also, we include financial and other information by business in Note 21 Segment Reporting
in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report here by reference.

We operate four major businesses engaged in providing
banking, asset management and global fund processing products and services. Assets, revenue and earnings attributable to foreign activities were not material in the periods presented.

During the third quarter of 2005 we reorganized our banking businesses into two units, Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking, aligning our reporting with our client base and with the
organizational changes we made in connection with our One PNC initiative. The Retail Banking business segment comprises consumer and small business customers. The Corporate & Institutional Banking business segment includes middle market and
corporate customers. Amounts previously reported under several of our former business segments (Regional Community Banking, PNC Advisors and Wholesale Banking) have been reclassified to reflect this new reporting structure. Intercompany eliminations
and other adjustments made to combine Regional Community Banking and PNC Advisors for prior periods were not significant. Our Current Reports on Form 8-K dated September 30, 2005 and December 28, 2005 contain additional information
regarding this new reporting structure.

ANKING

Retail Banking provides deposit, lending, brokerage, trust, investment management and cash management services to approximately 2.5 million consumer and small
business customers within our primary geographic area.

Our goal is to generate sustainable revenue growth by consistently increasing our customer base. We
seek additional revenue growth by attempting to sell additional products and services to these customers. In addition, we are focused on optimizing our network of branches by opening stand-alone and in-store branches in attractive sites while
consolidating or selling branches with less opportunity for growth.

We acquired Riggs National Corporation (“Riggs”), a Washington, D.C. based
banking company, effective May 13, 2005. The acquisition gives us a substantial presence on which to build a market leading franchise in the affluent Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. In connection with the acquisition, Riggs shareholders
received an aggregate of approximately $297 million in cash and 6.6 million shares of PNC common stock valued at $356 million.

We completed our
acquisition of United National Bancorp, Inc. (“United National”) on January 1, 2004. United National shareholders received an aggregate of approximately $321 million in cash and 6.6 million shares of our common stock valued at
$360 million.

BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States, with approximately $453 billion of assets
under management at December 31, 2005. BlackRock provides diversified investment management services to institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and alternative investment
products. Mutual funds include the flagship fund families,

BlackRock Funds

and

BlackRock Liquidity Funds.

In addition, BlackRock provides risk management, investment system outsourcing and financial advisory services to institutional
investors under the BlackRock Solutions® brand name.

On February 15, 2006, we announced that BlackRock and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.
(“Merrill Lynch”) had entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Merrill Lynch will contribute its investment management business to BlackRock in exchange for newly issued BlackRock common and preferred stock. Upon the closing
of this transaction, which we expect to occur on or around September 30, 2006, BlackRock’s assets under management will increase to almost $1 trillion and Merrill Lynch will own an approximate 49% economic interest in BlackRock. We will
continue to own approximately 44.5 million shares of BlackRock common stock, representing an ownership interest of approximately 34%. In addition, upon closing, our investment in BlackRock will increase resulting in an after-tax gain of
approximately $1.6 billion, subject to adjustments through closing. This gain will significantly improve our capital position.

This transaction must be
approved by BlackRock shareholders and is subject to obtaining appropriate regulatory and other approvals. We currently control more than 80% of the voting interest in BlackRock and will vote our interest in support of the transaction. Additional
information on this transaction is included in Note 26 Subsequent Event in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed February 15, 2006 and February 22, 2006, and in
BlackRock’s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed February 15, 2006 and February 22, 2006.

Effective January 31, 2005, BlackRock acquired
SSRM Holdings, Inc. (“SSRM”), the holding company of State Street Research & Management Company and SSR Realty Advisors Inc. (subsequently renamed BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc.), from MetLife, Inc. for an adjusted purchase price
of approximately $265 million in cash and approximately 550,000 shares of BlackRock restricted class A common stock valued at $37 million. Additional cash consideration may be paid contingent on certain matters as described in Note 2 Acquisitions in
the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. SSRM, through its subsidiaries, actively manages stock, bond, balanced and real estate portfolios for both institutional and individual investors. Substantially all of SSRM’s
operations were integrated into BlackRock as of the closing date. BlackRock acquired assets under management totaling $50 billion in connection with this transaction.

Also in January 2005, PNC Bank, N.A. transferred BlackRock, one of its operating subsidiaries, to PNC Bancorp, Inc. The transfer was effected primarily to give BlackRock



more operating flexibility, particularly in connection with its acquisition of SSRM. This transaction resulted in a net
reduction in regulatory capital for PNC Bank, N.A. of approximately $500 million. As a condition for regulatory approval of this transfer, PNC Bank, N.A. issued a new series of perpetual non-cumulative preferred shares to PNC totaling $500 million,
thus maintaining the risk-based capital and leverage ratios of PNC Bank, N.A. at approximately the same level as before the BlackRock restructuring.

The
ability of BlackRock to grow assets under management is the key driver of increases in revenue, earnings and, ultimately, shareholder value. BlackRock’s strategies for growth in assets under management include a focus on achieving client
investment performance objectives in a manner consistent with their risk preferences and delivering excellent client service. The business dedicates significant resources to attracting and retaining talented professionals and to the ongoing
enhancement of its investment technology and operating capabilities to deliver on its strategy.

BlackRock is approximately 70% owned by PNC and is
consolidated into PNC’s financial statements. Accordingly, approximately 30% of BlackRock’s earnings are recognized as minority interest expense in our Consolidated Income Statement.

The following statistical information is included on the indicated pages of this Report and is incorporated herein by reference:

SUPERVISION

AND

REGULATION

O

VERVIEW

PNC is a bank holding company
registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended (“BHC Act”) and a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB Act”).

We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, some of which are highlighted below. You should also read Note 4 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report,
included here for reference, for additional information regarding our regulatory issues. Applicable laws and regulations restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary,
mutual fund and other customers, among other things. They also restrict our ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from bank subsidiaries and impose capital adequacy requirements. The consequences of noncompliance can include
substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions.

In addition, we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by, among other regulatory
bodies, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). We are subject to examination by these regulators, which results in examination reports
and ratings (which are not publicly available) that can impact the conduct and growth of our businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk,
management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. An examination downgrade by any of our federal bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant limitations on our activities and growth.
These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply
with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations.



We are also subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) by virtue of our status as
a public company and due to the nature of some of our businesses.

As a regulated financial services firm, our relationships and good standing with
regulators are of fundamental importance to the continuation and growth of our businesses. The Federal Reserve, OCC, SEC, and other domestic and foreign regulators have broad enforcement powers, and powers to approve, deny, or refuse to act upon our
applications or notices to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations.

Over the last several
years, there has been an increasing regulatory focus on compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, resulting in, among other things, several significant publicly announced enforcement actions, including those relating to Riggs.
There has also been a heightened focus recently on the protection of confidential customer information. In response to this environment, we are working to enhance our procedures for compliance with laws and regulations in these areas.

There are numerous rules governing the regulation of financial services institutions and their holding companies. Accordingly, the following discussion is general in
nature and does not purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws and regulations that apply to us.

ANK

R

EGULATION

As a bank holding company and a financial holding company, we are subject to supervision and
regular inspection by the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiary banks and their subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by applicable federal and state banking agencies, principally the OCC with respect to PNC Bank, N.A. and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Office of the State Bank Commissioner of Delaware with respect to PNC Bank, Delaware.

Parent Company Liquidity and Dividends

. The principal source of our liquidity at the parent company level is dividends from PNC Bank, N.A. Our subsidiary banks are subject to various federal and state restrictions on their
ability to pay dividends to PNC Bancorp, Inc., the direct parent of the subsidiary banks, which in turn may affect the ability of PNC Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends to PNC at the parent company level. Our subsidiary banks are also subject to federal
laws limiting extensions of credit to their parent holding company and non-bank affiliates as discussed in Note 4 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, which is incorporated herein by
reference. Further information is also available in the Liquidity Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.

Under Federal Reserve policy, a
bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such bank. Consistent with the “source of strength” policy for subsidiary banks, the Federal
Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the
prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the corporation’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. This policy does not currently have a negative impact on PNC’s ability to pay dividends at
our current level.

Additional Powers Under the GLB Act

. The GLB Act permits a qualifying bank holding company to become a “financial
holding company” and thereby to affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company. Permitted affiliates include securities underwriters and dealers,
insurance companies and companies engaged in other activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or are determined by the
Federal Reserve unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. We became a financial holding company as of March 13, 2000.

The
Federal Reserve is the “umbrella” regulator of a financial holding company, with its operating entities, such as its subsidiary broker-dealers, investment managers, investment companies, insurance companies and banks, also subject to the
jurisdiction of various federal and state “functional” regulators with normal regulatory responsibility for companies in their lines of business.

As subsidiaries of a financial holding company under the GLB Act, our non-bank subsidiaries are allowed to conduct new financial activities or acquire non-bank financial companies with after-the-fact notice to the Federal Reserve. In
addition, our non-bank subsidiaries (and any financial subsidiaries of subsidiary banks) are now permitted to engage in certain activities that were not permitted for banks and bank holding companies prior to enactment of the GLB Act, and to engage
on less restrictive terms in certain activities that were previously permitted. Among other activities, we currently rely on our status as a financial holding company to conduct mutual fund distribution activities, merchant banking activities, and
underwriting and dealing activities.

To continue to qualify for financial holding company status, our subsidiary banks must maintain “well
capitalized” capital ratios, examination ratings of “1” or “2” (on a scale of 1 to 5), and certain other criteria that are incorporated into the definition of “well managed” under the BHC Act and Federal Reserve
rules. If we were to no longer qualify for this status, we could not continue to enjoy the after-the-fact notice process for new non-banking activities and non-banking acquisitions, and would be required promptly to enter into an agreement with the
Federal Reserve providing a plan for our subsidiary banks to meet the “well capitalized” and “well managed” criteria. The Federal Reserve would have broad authority to limit our activities. Failure to satisfy the criteria within
a six-month period could result in a requirement that we conform existing non-banking activities to activities that were permissible prior to the enactment of the GLB Act. If a subsidiary bank failed to maintain a “satisfactory” or better
rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (“CRA”), we could not commence new activities or make new investments in reliance on the GLB Act.



In addition, the GLB Act permits a national bank, such as PNC Bank, N.A., to engage in expanded activities through the
formation of a “financial subsidiary.” In order to qualify to establish or acquire a financial subsidiary, PNC Bank, N.A. and each of its depository institution affiliates must be “well capitalized” and “well managed”
and may not have a less than “satisfactory” CRA rating. A national bank that is one of the largest 50 insured banks in the United States, such as PNC Bank, N.A., must also have issued debt (which, for this purpose, may include the
uninsured portion of PNC Bank, N.A.’s long-term certificates of deposit) with certain minimum ratings. PNC Bank, N.A. has filed a financial subsidiary certification with the OCC and currently engages in insurance agency activities through a
financial subsidiary. PNC Bank, N.A. may also generally engage through a financial subsidiary in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. Certain activities, however, are impermissible for a financial
subsidiary of a national bank, including insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development, and merchant banking.

If
one of our subsidiary banks were to fail to meet the “well capitalized” or “well managed” and related criteria, PNC Bank, N.A. would be required to enter into an agreement with the OCC to correct the condition. The OCC would have
the authority to limit the activities of the bank. If the condition were not corrected within six months or within any additional time granted by the OCC, PNC Bank, N.A. could be required to conform the activities of any of its financial
subsidiaries to activities in which a national bank could engage directly. In addition, if the bank or any insured depository institution affiliate receives a less than satisfactory CRA examination rating, PNC Bank, N.A. would not be permitted to
engage in any new activities or to make new investments in reliance on the financial subsidiary authority.

Other Federal Reserve and OCC
Regulation

. The federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective action as deemed appropriate for an insured depository institution and its holding company. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in
question is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Generally, the smaller an
institution’s capital base in relation to its total assets, the greater the scope and severity of the agencies’ powers, ultimately permitting the agencies to appoint a receiver for the institution. Business activities may also be
influenced by an institution’s capital classification. For instance, only a “well capitalized” depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval and an “adequately capitalized” depository
institution may accept brokered deposits only with prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2005, both of our subsidiary banks exceeded the required ratios for classification as “well capitalized.” For additional discussion of
capital adequacy requirements, we refer you to “Capital And Funding Sources” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report and to Note 4 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 of this Report.

Laws and regulations limit the scope of our permitted activities and investments. In addition to the activities that would
be permitted a financial subsidiary, national banks (such as PNC Bank, N.A.) and their operating subsidiaries may engage in any activities that are determined by the OCC to be part of or incidental to the business of banking.

Moreover, examination ratings of “3” or lower, lower capital ratios than peer group institutions, regulatory concerns regarding management, controls, assets,
operations or other factors, can all potentially result in practical limitations on the ability of a bank or bank holding company to engage in new activities, grow, acquire new businesses, repurchase its stock or pay dividends, or to continue to
conduct existing activities.

The Federal Reserve’s prior approval is required whenever we propose to acquire all or substantially all of the assets
of any bank or thrift, to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank or thrift, or to merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company or thrift holding company. When reviewing bank
acquisition applications for approval, the Federal Reserve considers, among other things, each subsidiary bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves in accordance with the CRA. Our ability to grow through
acquisitions could be limited by these approval requirements. At December 31, 2005, both of our bank subsidiaries, PNC Bank, N.A. and PNC Bank, Delaware, were rated “outstanding” with respect to CRA.

FDIC Insurance

. Both of our subsidiary banks are insured by the FDIC and subject to premium assessments. Regulatory matters could increase the cost of FDIC
deposit insurance premiums to an insured bank. Since 1996, the FDIC has not assessed banks in the most favorable capital and assessment risk classification categories for insurance premiums for most deposits, due to the favorable ratio of the assets
in the FDIC’s deposit insurance funds to the aggregate level of insured deposits outstanding. This has resulted in significant cost savings to all insured banks. Deposit insurance premiums are assessed as a percentage of the deposits of the
insured institution. If the FDIC assesses premiums for all deposits, it would impose a significant cost to all insured banks, including our subsidiary banks, reducing the net spread between deposit and other bank funding costs and the earnings from
assets and services of the bank, and thus the net income of the bank. FDIC deposit insurance premiums are “risk based”; therefore, higher fee percentages would be charged to banks that have lower capital ratios or higher risk profiles.
These risk profiles may take into account weaknesses that are found by the primary banking regulator through its examination and supervision of the bank. A negative evaluation by the FDIC or a bank’s primary federal banking regulator could
increase the costs to a bank and result in an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher than that of competing banks in a lower risk category.

Our subsidiary
banks are subject to “cross-guarantee” provisions under federal law that provide that if one of these banks fails or requires FDIC assistance, the FDIC may assess



a “commonly-controlled” bank for the estimated losses suffered by the FDIC. Such liability could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or that of the assessed bank. While the FDIC’s claim is junior to the claims of depositors, holders of secured liabilities, general creditors and subordinated creditors, it is superior to the
claims of the bank’s shareholders and affiliates, including PNC and intermediate bank holding companies.

EGULATION

The SEC, together with either the OCC or the
Federal Reserve, regulates our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries, including one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are also subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(“NASD”), among others. Hilliard Lyons is also a member of the New York Stock Exchange and subject to its regulations and supervision. Two of BlackRock’s subsidiaries are registered as commodity pool operators with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association, and are subject to regulation by them.

Several of our subsidiaries, including some of
BlackRock’s subsidiaries, are registered with the SEC as investment advisers and, therefore, are subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the SEC’s regulations thereunder. The principal purpose of the
regulations applicable to investment advisers is the protection of clients and the securities markets, rather than the protection of creditors and shareholders of investment advisers. The regulations applicable to investment advisers cover all
aspects of the investment advisory business, including limitations on the ability of investment advisers to charge performance-based or non-refundable fees to clients; record-keeping; operational, marketing and reporting requirements; disclosure
requirements; limitations on principal transactions between an adviser or its affiliates and advisory clients; as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions. Our investment advisory subsidiaries also may be subject to state securities laws and
regulations. In addition, our investment adviser subsidiaries, such as some BlackRock subsidiaries, that are investment advisors to registered investment companies and other managed accounts are subject to the requirements of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, and the SEC’s regulations thereunder.

Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC, other federal and
state regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of investment advisers. The profitability of
investment advisers could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.

Recently, the SEC and other governmental agencies have been investigating the mutual fund industry. The SEC has adopted and proposed various rules, and legislation has
been introduced in Congress, intended to reform the regulation of this industry. The effect of regulatory reform has, and is likely to continue to, increase the extent of regulation of the mutual fund industry and impose additional compliance
obligations and costs on our subsidiaries involved with that industry.

Under various provisions of the federal securities laws (including in particular
those applicable to broker-dealers, investment advisers and registered investment companies and their service providers), a determination by a court or regulatory agency that certain violations have occurred at a company or its affiliates can result
in a limitation of permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations can also affect a public company in its timing
and ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the capital markets. In addition, expansion of activities of a broker-dealer generally requires approval of the New York Stock Exchange and/or NASD, and regulators may take into account a
variety of considerations in acting upon such applications, including internal controls, capital, management experience and quality, and supervisory concerns.

For additional information about the regulation of BlackRock, we refer you to the discussion under the “Regulation” section of Item 1 Business in BlackRock’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which may be obtained
electronically at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

COMPETITION

We are subject to intense competition from various financial institutions and
from non-bank entities that engage in similar activities without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions.

In making loans, our
subsidiary banks compete with traditional banking institutions as well as consumer finance companies, leasing companies and other non-bank lenders. Loan pricing and credit standards are under competitive pressure as lenders seek to deploy capital
and a broader range of borrowers have access to capital markets. Traditional deposit activities are subject to pricing pressures and customer migration as a result of intense competition for consumer investment dollars.

Our subsidiary banks compete for deposits with the following:

•

Other commercial banks,

•

Savings banks,

•

Savings and loan associations,

•

Credit unions,

•

Treasury management service companies,

•

Insurance companies, and

•

Issuers of commercial paper and other securities, including mutual funds.

Our various non-bank subsidiaries engaged in investment banking and private equity activities compete with the following:

•

Commercial banks,

•

Investment banking firms,

•

Merchant banks,

•

Insurance companies,

•

Private equity firms, and

•

Other investment vehicles.



In providing asset management services, our subsidiaries compete with the following:

•

Investment management firms,

•

Large banks and other financial institutions,

•

Brokerage firms,

•

Mutual fund complexes, and

•

Insurance companies.

The fund servicing business is also highly
competitive, with a relatively small number of providers. Merger, acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry has also impacted the number of existing or potential fund servicing clients and has intensified competition.

The ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry. Technology is important not
only with respect to delivery of financial services, but also in processing information. Each of our businesses consistently must make significant technological investments to remain competitive.

ITEM


A

–

RISK

FACTORS

We are subject to a number of risks
potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Indeed, as a financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in every one of our transactions and are presented by every business
decision we make. Thus, we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks.

In many cases, there are risks that are known to exist at the outset of a transaction but which cannot reasonably be eliminated. For example, every loan transaction presents credit risk (the risk that the borrower may not perform in
accordance with contractual terms) and interest rate risk (a potential loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movement in market interest rates or credit spreads), with the nature and extent of these risks principally depending on the
identity of the borrower and overall economic conditions. These risks are inherent in every loan transaction; if we wish to make loans, we must manage these risks through the terms and structure of the loans and through management of our deposits
and other funding sources. The success of our business is dependent on our ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can balance appropriately revenue generation and profitability with these
inherent risks. We discuss our principal risk management processes and, in appropriate places, related historical performance in the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.

The following are the key risk factors that affect us. These risk factors are also discussed further in other parts of this Report.



A sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal
markets in which we do business could adversely affect our business and operating results.

PNC’s business could be adversely affected to the
extent that weaknesses in business and economic conditions have direct or indirect impacts on our customers and counterparties. These conditions could lead, for example, to one or more of the following:

•

A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us,

•

A decrease in the value of our loans held for sale,

•

A decrease in the usage of unfunded commitments,

•

A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us, and

•

An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us. An
increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.

Although many of our businesses are national and some are international in scope, our retail banking business is concentrated within our retail branch network footprint
(Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the greater Washington, D.C. area), and thus that business is particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in these regions.

Changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact our assets and liabilities and our performance.

Given our business mix, our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans, and the fact that most of our assets and liabilities are financial
in nature, we tend to be particularly sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the financial markets.

In addition to the impact on the economy generally, with some of the potential effects outlined above, changes in
interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve, or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us in one or more of the following ways:

•

Such changes could affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities, as well as the value of some or all of our
on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments or the value of equity investments that we hold,

•

To the extent to which we access capital markets to raise funds to support our business, such changes could affect the cost of such funds or our ability to raise such funds, and

•

Such changes could affect the value of the assets that we manage or otherwise administer for others or the assets for which we provide processing services. Although we are not
directly impacted by changes in the value of assets that we manage or administer for others or for which we provide processing services, decreases in the value of those assets would affect our fee income relating to those assets and could result in
decreased demand for our services.

As a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing
instruments, the monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, which have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance, can affect the activities and results of
operations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as PNC and our subsidiaries. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and market interest rates. The actions of the Federal
Reserve influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Both due to the impact on
rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the Federal Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve’s policies also influence, to a significant extent, our cost of funding. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary,
tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on our activities and results of operations.

We operate in a highly competitive environment,
both in terms of the products and services we offer and the geographic markets in which we conduct business. Competition could adversely impact our customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as our credit spreads and product pricing,
causing us to lose market share and deposits and revenues.

We are subject to intense competition from various financial institutions and from non-bank
entities that engage in similar activities without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions.

In making loans, our subsidiary banks
compete with traditional banking institutions as well as consumer finance companies, leasing companies and other non-bank lenders. Loan pricing and credit standards are under competitive pressure as lenders seek to deploy capital and a broader range
of borrowers have access to capital markets.

Traditional deposit activities are subject to pricing pressures and customer migration as a result of intense
competition for consumer investment dollars. Our subsidiary banks compete for deposits with other commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, treasury



management service companies, insurance companies, and issuers of commercial paper and other securities, including mutual
funds.

Our various non-bank subsidiaries engaged in investment banking and private equity activities compete with commercial banks, investment banking
firms, merchant banks, insurance companies, private equity firms, and other investment vehicles.

In providing asset management services, our subsidiaries
compete with investment management firms, large banks and other financial institutions, brokerage firms, mutual fund complexes, and insurance companies.

The fund servicing business is also highly competitive, with a relatively small number of providers. Merger, acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry has also impacted the number of existing or potential
fund servicing clients and has intensified competition.

In all of these areas, the principal bases for competition are pricing (including the interest
rates charged on loans or paid on interest-bearing deposits), the range of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service (including convenience and responsiveness to customer needs and concerns). The ability to access and use
technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry. Technology is important not only with respect to delivery of financial services but also in processing information. Each of our businesses consistently
must make significant technological investments to remain competitive.

Our failure to execute successfully our One PNC initiative would negatively
impact our financial performance over the next several years.

Our future results are likely to be affected significantly by the results of the
implementation of our One PNC initiative, as discussed in Item 7 of this Report. Our ability to improve profitability is, in particular, dependent to a meaningful extent on the success of this initiative. Generally, the amounts of our
anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements are based to some extent on estimates and assumptions regarding future business performance and expenses, and, although we believe them to be reasonable at the present time, these estimates and
assumptions may prove to be inaccurate in some respects, due to changing conditions or otherwise. For example:

•

Some of the ideas may take longer to implement than anticipated or may cost more to implement than anticipated;

•

The implementation of cost savings ideas may have unintended impacts on our ability to attract and retain business and customers;

•

Revenue enhancement ideas may not be successful in the marketplace or may result in unintended costs;

•

Assumed attrition required to achieve workforce reductions may not come in the right places or at the right times to meet planned goals; and

•

Changing market conditions may force us to alter the implementation or continuation of cost savings or revenue enhancement ideas.

As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain the cost savings and revenue enhancements that we are anticipating from the One PNC initiative.

We grow our business in part by acquiring from time to time other financial services companies, and these acquisitions present us with a number of risks and
uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.

Acquisitions of other financial services companies also present risks to PNC other than those presented by the nature of the business acquired. In particular, acquisitions may be substantially more expensive to complete (including as a
result of costs incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired company) and the anticipated benefits (including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains) may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected. In some
cases, acquisitions involve our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets, and these situations also present risks resulting from our inexperience in these new areas. As a regulated financial institution, our pursuit of attractive
acquisition opportunities could be negatively impacted due to regulatory delays or other regulatory issues. Regulatory and/or legal issues relating to the pre-acquisition operations of an acquired business may cause reputational harm to PNC
following the acquisition and integration of the acquired business into ours and may result in additional future costs and expenses arising as a result of those issues. Recent acquisitions, including our acquisition of Riggs, continue to present the
post-closing risks and uncertainties described above.

The performance of our asset management businesses may be adversely affected by the relative
performance of our products compared with alternative investments.

Asset management revenue is primarily based on a percentage of the value of assets
under management and, in some cases, performance fees, in most cases expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on assets under management, and thus is impacted by general changes in capital markets valuations and customer preferences. In
addition, investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of assets under management. Poor investment performance could impair revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products.
Also, performance fees could be lower or nonexistent. Additionally, the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish.



The performance of our fund servicing business may be adversely affected by changes in investor preferences, or
changes in existing or potential fund servicing clients or alternative providers.

Fund servicing fees are primarily derived from the market value of
the assets and the number of shareholder accounts that we administer for our clients. The performance of our fund processing business is thus partially dependent on the underlying performance of its fund clients and, in particular, their ability to
attract and retain customers. Changes in interest rates or a sustained weakness, weakening or volatility in the debt and equity markets could (in addition to affecting directly the value of assets administered as discussed above) influence an
investor’s decision to invest or maintain an investment in a particular mutual fund or other pooled investment product. Other factors beyond our control may impact the ability of our fund clients to attract or retain customers or customer
funds, including changes in preferences as to certain investment styles. Further, to the extent that our fund clients’ businesses are adversely affected by ongoing governmental investigations into the practices of the mutual and hedge fund
industries, our fund processing business’ results also could be adversely impacted. As a result of these types of factors, fluctuations may occur in the level or value of assets for which we provide processing services. In addition, this
regulatory and business environment is likely to continue to result in operating margin pressure for our various services.

As a regulated financial
services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and to comprehensive examination and supervision by regulators, which affects our business as well as our competitive position.

PNC is a bank and financial holding company and is subject to numerous governmental regulations involving both its business and organization. Our businesses are subject
to regulation by multiple bank regulatory bodies as well as multiple securities industry regulators. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from bank subsidiaries and impose capital adequacy
requirements. They also restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, mutual fund and other customers, and for the protection of customer information, among other
things. The consequences of noncompliance can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions as well as damage to our reputation and business.

In
addition, we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by banking and other regulatory bodies. Examination reports and ratings (which often are not publicly available) and other aspects of this supervisory framework can materially
impact the conduct, growth, and profitability of our businesses.

We discuss these and other regulatory issues applicable to PNC in the Supervision and
Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report and in Note 4 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and here by reference.

Over the last several years, there has been an increasing regulatory focus on compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, resulting in, among other
things, several significant publicly-announced enforcement actions, including those relating to Riggs National Corporation. There has also been a heightened focus recently, by customers and the media as well as by regulators, on the protection of
confidential customer information. In response to this environment, we are working to enhance our procedures for compliance with laws and regulations in these areas. A failure to have adequate procedures to comply with anti-money laundering laws and
regulations or to protect the confidentiality of customer information could expose us to damages, fines and regulatory penalties, which could be significant, and could also injure our reputation with customers and others with whom we do business.

Our business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by natural disasters, by terrorist activities or by
international hostilities.

The impact of natural disasters, terrorist activities and international hostilities cannot be predicted with respect to
severity or duration. However, any of these could impact us directly (for example, by causing significant damage to our facilities or preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course), or could impact us indirectly through a direct
impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that natural disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the economy and
financial and capital markets generally. These types of impacts could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and
provisions for credit losses.

Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency
planning, including our ability to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of natural disasters or terrorist activities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of
national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon.

COMMENTS

There are
no SEC staff comments regarding PNC’s periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act that are pending resolution.

ITEM 2 – PROPERTIES

Our executive and administrative offices are located at One PNC Plaza, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The
thirty-story structure is owned by PNC Bank, N. A. We occupy the entire building. In addition, PNC Bank, N.A. owns a thirty-four story structure adjacent to One PNC Plaza, known as Two PNC Plaza, that houses additional office space.



We own or lease numerous other premises for use in conducting business activities. The facilities owned or occupied under
lease by our subsidiaries are considered by us to be adequate. We include here by reference the additional information regarding our properties in Note 10 Premises, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements in the Notes To Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

ITEM 3 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Some of our subsidiaries are defendants (or have potential contractual contribution obligations
to other defendants) in several pending lawsuits brought during late 2002 and 2003 arising out of the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications Corporation and its subsidiaries. There also are threatened additional proceedings arising out of the same
matters. One of the lawsuits was brought, on Adelphia’s behalf by the unsecured creditors’ committee and equity committee in Adelphia’s consolidated bankruptcy proceeding and was removed to the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York by order dated February 9, 2006. The other lawsuits, one of which is a putative consolidated class action, were brought by holders of debt and equity securities of Adelphia and have been consolidated for pretrial
purposes in that district court. These lawsuits arise out of lending and securities underwriting activities engaged in by these PNC subsidiaries together with other financial services companies. In the aggregate, more than 400 other financial
services companies and numerous other companies and individuals have been named as defendants in one or more of the lawsuits. Collectively, with respect to some or all of the defendants, the lawsuits allege federal law claims, including violations
of federal securities and other federal laws, violations of common law duties, aiding and abetting such violations, voidable preference payments, and fraudulent transfers, among other matters. The lawsuits seek unquantified monetary damages,
interest, attorneys’ fees and other expenses, and a return of the alleged voidable preference and fraudulent transfer payments, among other remedies. We believe that we have defenses to the claims against us in these lawsuits, as well as
potential claims against third parties, and intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously. These lawsuits involve complex issues of law and fact, presenting complicated relationships among the many financial and other participants in the events giving
rise to these lawsuits, and have not progressed to the point where we can predict the outcome of these lawsuits. It is not possible to determine what the likely aggregate recoveries on the part of the plaintiffs in these matters might be or the
portion of any such recoveries for which we would ultimately be responsible, but the final consequences to PNC could be material.

On April 29, 2005,
an amended complaint was filed in the putative class action against PNC; PNC Bank, N.A.; our Pension Plan and its Pension Committee in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (originally filed in December 2004). The
complaint claims violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), arising out of the January 1, 1999 conversion of our Pension Plan from a traditional defined benefit formula into a “cash
balance” formula, the design and continued operation of the Plan, and other related matters. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all current and former employee-participants in and beneficiaries of the Plan as of December 31, 1998 and
thereafter. Plaintiffs also seek to represent a subclass of all current and former employee- participants in and beneficiaries of the Plan as of December 31, 1998 and thereafter who were or would have become eligible for an early retirement
subsidy under the former Plan at some time prior to the date of the amended complaint. The plaintiffs are seeking unquantified damages and equitable relief available under ERISA, including interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees. On
November 21, 2005, the court granted our motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Plaintiffs have appealed this ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. We believe that we have substantial defenses to the claims
against us in this lawsuit and intend to defend it vigorously.

In its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, Riggs disclosed a number of
pending lawsuits. All material lawsuits have been finally resolved or settlement agreements have been reached, in some cases subject to final documentation or court approval. None of the pending settlement amounts where the settlement has not been
completed is material to PNC. The pending settlement amount for each of these lawsuits has been reserved upon the recording of our acquisition of Riggs.

As a result of the acquisition of Riggs, PNC is now responsible for Riggs’ obligations to provide indemnification to its directors, officers, and, in some cases, employees and agents against certain liabilities incurred as a result of
their service on behalf of or at the request of Riggs. PNC is also now responsible for Riggs’ obligations to advance on behalf of covered individuals costs incurred in connection with certain claims or proceedings, subject to written
undertakings to repay all amounts so advanced if it is ultimately determined that the individual is not entitled to indemnification. Since the acquisition, we have advanced such costs on behalf of covered individuals from Riggs and expect to
continue to do so in the future at least with respect to lawsuits and other legal matters identified in Riggs’ first quarter 2005 Form 10-Q.

There
are several pending judicial or administrative proceedings or other matters arising out of the three 2001 PAGIC transactions. These pending proceedings or other matters are described below. Among the requirements of a June 2003 Deferred Prosecution
Agreement that one of our subsidiaries entered into relating to the PAGIC transactions was the establishment of a Restitution Fund through our $90 million contribution. The Restitution Fund will be available to satisfy claims, including for the
settlement of the pending securities litigation referred to below. Louis W. Fryman, chairman of Fox Rothschild LLP in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is administering the Restitution Fund.

In December 2004 and January and March 2005, we entered into settlement agreements relating to certain of the lawsuits and other claims arising out of the PAGIC transactions. These



settlements are described below, following a description of each of these pending
proceedings and other matters.

The several putative class action complaints filed during 2002 in the United States District Court for the Western District
of Pennsylvania arising out of the PAGIC transactions were consolidated in a consolidated class action complaint brought on behalf of purchasers of our common stock between July 19, 2001 and July 18, 2002 (the “Class Period”).
The consolidated class action complaint names PNC, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer, our Controller, and our independent auditors for 2001 as defendants and seeks unquantified damages, interest,
attorneys’ fees and other expenses. The consolidated class action complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws related to disclosures regarding the PAGIC transactions and related matters.

In August 2002, the United States Department of Labor began a formal investigation of the Administrative Committee of our Incentive Savings Plan (“Plan”) in
connection with the Administrative Committee’s conduct relating to our common stock held by the Plan. Both the Administrative Committee and PNC have cooperated fully with the investigation. In June 2003, the Administrative Committee retained
Independent Fiduciary Services, Inc. (“IFS”) to serve as an independent fiduciary charged with the exclusive authority and responsibility to act on behalf of the Plan in connection with the pending securities litigation referred to above
and to evaluate any legal rights the Plan might have against any parties relating to the PAGIC transactions. This authority includes representing the Plan’s interests in connection with the Restitution Fund set up under the Deferred Prosecution
Agreement. The Department of Labor has communicated with IFS in connection with the engagement.

We received a letter in June 2003 on behalf of an alleged
shareholder demanding that we take appropriate legal action against our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer, and our Controller, as well as any other individuals or entities allegedly responsible for causing
damage to PNC as a result of the PAGIC transactions. The Board referred this matter to a special committee of the Board for evaluation. The special committee completed its evaluation and reported its findings to the Board of Directors and to counsel
for the alleged shareholder. The special committee recommended against bringing any claims against our current or former executive officers but made certain recommendations with respect to resolution of potential claims we had with respect to
certain other third parties.

In July 2003, the lead underwriter on our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage filed a lawsuit for a declaratory
judgment against PNC and PNC ICLC in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The complaint seeks a determination that the defendants breached the terms and conditions of the policy and, as a result, the policy does
not provide coverage for any loss relating to or arising out of the Department of Justice investigation or the PAGIC transactions. Alternatively, the complaint seeks a determination that the policy does not provide coverage for the payments made
pursuant to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The complaint also seeks attorneys’ fees and costs. In July 2004, the court granted our motion to stay the action until resolution of the claims against PNC in the pending consolidated class
action described above.

On December 17, 2004, we entered into a tentative settlement of the consolidated class action. On March 25, 2005, the
parties filed a stipulation of settlement of this lawsuit with the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. This settlement also covered claims by the plaintiffs against AIG Financial Products and others related to the
PAGIC transactions.

On December 17, 2004, we also settled all claims between us, on the one hand, and AIG Financial Products and its affiliate,
American International Surplus Lines Insurance Company (“AISLIC”), on the other hand, related to the PAGIC transactions. AIG Financial Products was our counterparty in the PAGIC transactions, and AISLIC is one of the insurers under our
Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage. Subsequently, we settled claims against two of the other insurers under our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage, as described below. Each of the amounts in these settlements represents a portion of
the insurer’s share of our overall claim against our insurers with respect to any amounts disbursed out of the Restitution Fund. We are preserving our claim against our insurers with which we have not settled.

The tentative settlement of the consolidated class action remains subject to court approval. The court held a hearing on August 4, 2005 to determine whether to
approve the proposed settlement agreement of the consolidated class action.

The following are the key elements of these settlements that remain
conditional at present, pending court approval of the tentative settlement of the consolidated class action:

•

Payments into Settlement Fund

. The insurers under our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage have funded $30 million to be used for the benefit of the class. AIG Financial
Products has funded an additional $4 million to be used for the same purpose. The plaintiffs have been in contact with Mr. Fryman, the administrator of the Restitution Fund, and intend to coordinate the administration and distribution of these
settlement funds with the distribution of the Restitution Fund. Neither PNC nor any of our current or former officers, directors or employees will be required to contribute any funds to this settlement.

•

Assignment of Claims

. We have assigned to the plaintiffs claims we may have against the non-settling defendant in the consolidated class action and all other unaffiliated
third parties (other than AIG Financial Products and its predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and their respective



directors, officers and employees (collectively, “AIG”)) relating to the subject matter of this
lawsuit.

•

Insurance Claims

. In March 2005, we settled our claim against one of our insurers under our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage related to our contribution of $90
million to the Restitution Fund. Under this settlement, the insurer has paid us $11.25 million, but we are obligated to return this amount if the settlement of the consolidated class action referred to above does not receive court approval, does not
become effective or becomes unenforceable. The amount of this settlement will not be recognized in our income statement until the potential obligation to return the funds has been eliminated. This settlement was in addition to settlements with
AISLIC in December 2004 and with another of our insurers under the Executive Blended Risk policy in January 2005.

•

Other Claims

. In connection with the settlement of the consolidated class action, the claims of IFS on behalf of our Incentive Savings Plan and its participants are being
resolved and the class covered by the settlement is being expanded to include participants in the Plan. The Department of Labor is not, however, a party to this settlement and thus the settlement does not necessarily resolve its investigation.

In addition, the derivative claims asserted by one of our putative shareholders and any other derivative demands that may be
filed in connection with the PAGIC transactions are being resolved as a result of the settlement of the consolidated class action.

•

Releases

. We are releasing the insurers providing our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage from any further liability to PNC arising out of the events that gave rise to
the consolidated class action, except for the claims against these insurers (other than those with whom we have settled) relating to the $90 million payment to the Restitution Fund. In addition, PNC and AIG are releasing each other with respect to
all claims between us arising out of the PAGIC transactions.

We will be responsible for the costs of administering the settlement and the
Restitution Fund and may incur additional costs in the future in connection with the advancement of expenses and/or indemnification obligations related to the subject matter of this lawsuit. We do not expect such costs to be material.

In connection with industry-wide investigations of practices in the mutual fund industry including market timing, late day trading, employee trading in mutual funds and
other matters, several of our subsidiaries have received requests for information and other inquiries from state and federal governmental and regulatory authorities. These subsidiaries are fully cooperating in all of these matters.

In addition to the proceedings or other matters described above, PNC and persons to whom we may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, are
subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other
legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in the proceedings or
other matters specifically described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period.

PNC is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States, operating businesses
engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management and global fund processing services. We operate directly and through numerous subsidiaries, providing many of our products and services nationally and others in our
primary geographic markets in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Ohio, Kentucky and the greater Washington, D.C. area. We also provide certain asset management and global fund processing services internationally.

Our
strategy to enhance shareholder value centers on achieving revenue growth in our various businesses underpinned by prudent management of risk, capital and expenses. In each of our business segments, the primary drivers of growth are the acquisition,
expansion and retention of customer relationships. We strive to achieve such growth in our customer base by providing convenient banking options, leading technological systems and a broad range of asset management products and services. We also
intend to grow through appropriate and targeted acquisitions and, in certain businesses, by expanding into new geographical markets.

In recent years, we
have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Our actions have created a balance sheet characterized by strong asset quality and
significant flexibility to take advantage, where appropriate, of changing interest rates and to adjust to changing market conditions.

On February 15,
2006, we announced that BlackRock and Merrill Lynch had entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Merrill Lynch will contribute its investment management business to BlackRock in exchange for newly issued BlackRock common and preferred
stock. Upon the closing of this transaction, which we expect to occur on or around September 30, 2006, BlackRock’s assets under management will increase to almost $1 trillion and Merrill Lynch will own an approximate 49% economic interest
in BlackRock. We will continue to own approximately 44.5 million shares of BlackRock common stock, representing an ownership interest of approximately 34%. In addition, upon closing, our investment in BlackRock will increase resulting in an
after-tax gain of approximately $1.6 billion, subject to adjustments through closing. This gain will significantly improve our capital position.

This
transaction must be approved by BlackRock shareholders and is subject to obtaining appropriate regulatory and other approvals. We currently control more than 80% of the voting interest in BlackRock and will vote our interest in support of the
transaction. Additional information on this transaction is included in Note 26 Subsequent Event in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed February 15, 2006 and February 22,
2006 and in BlackRock’s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed February 15, 2006 and February 22, 2006. To the extent that statements we make in this Report about our expectations for future results include results from BlackRock, those
expectations do not give any effect to the impact to PNC from the change in accounting for PNC’s interest in BlackRock that would take place when BlackRock and Merrill Lynch close this transaction.

On October 11, 2005, we acquired Harris Williams & Co. (“Harris Williams”), one of the nation’s largest firms focused on providing merger
and acquisition advisory and related services to middle market companies, including private equity firms and private and public companies. This acquisition should provide opportunities for commercial lending as well as wealth management and capital
markets business growth.

In May 2005, we successfully completed our acquisition of Riggs National Corporation (“Riggs”), a Washington,
D.C.-based banking company. The transaction gives us a substantial presence on which to build a market leading franchise in the affluent Washington metropolitan area.

We include additional information on Riggs, as well as the first quarter 2005 acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. (“SSRM”) by our majority-owned subsidiary, BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”), in Note 2
Acquisitions in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and here by reference. We also note that the SSRM and Harris Williams transactions were accretive to earnings in 2005 and we expect that the Riggs
acquisition will be accretive to earnings beginning in 2006.

NITIATIVE

The One PNC initiative, which began in January 2005, is an ongoing, company-wide initiative with goals of moving closer to the customer, improving our overall
efficiency and targeting resources to more value-added activities. PNC expects to realize $400 million of total pretax earnings benefit by 2007 from this initiative.

As a result of this intensive process, we have reorganized our banking businesses to streamline and to better serve our customer base. The initiative has resulted in a simplified and a more centrally managed
organization. As further described in our Current Reports on Form 8-K dated September 30, 2005 and December 28, 2005, and in Note 21 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, our
banking businesses have been reorganized into two units, Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking, and we have aligned our reporting accordingly.

PNC plans to achieve approximately $300 million of cost savings initiatives through a combination of workforce reduction and other efficiencies. Of the approximately 3,000 positions to be eliminated, approximately
1,800 had been eliminated as of December 31, 2005. We estimate that these changes will result in employee severance and other implementation costs of approximately $74 million, including $54 million recognized during the second half of 2005. We
expect that the remaining charges will be



incurred in 2006 and early 2007. The initiatives implemented to date have required approximately $11 million lower costs
than originally expected, and we expect to maintain that variance over the remainder of the One PNC program. In addition, PNC intends to achieve at least $100 million in net revenue growth through the implementation of various pricing and business
growth enhancements driven by the One PNC initiative. Initiatives to achieve this growth are progressing according to plan.

We realized a net pretax
financial benefit from the One PNC program of approximately $90 million in 2005, primarily in the latter half of the year and primarily in our banking businesses, which was $55 million more than we had previously estimated. We achieved this benefit
by accelerating some of the 2006 initiatives into 2005. We expect to capture approximately $265 million in value by the end of 2006 as originally planned.

ESULTS

Results for 2005 included the impact of the following items:

•

Implementation costs totaling $35 million after-tax, or $.12 per diluted share, related to the One PNC initiative;

•

Integration costs of $20 million after-tax, or $.07 per diluted share, comprised of provision for credit losses, noninterest expense and deferred taxes, related to the May 2005
acquisition of Riggs;

•

The reversal of deferred tax liabilities that benefited earnings by $45 million, or $.16 per diluted share, in the first quarter related to our transfer of ownership in BlackRock
from PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC Bank, N.A.”) to our intermediate bank holding company, PNC Bancorp, Inc., in January 2005; and

•

The $34 million after-tax benefit of a second quarter 2005 loan recovery.

Results for 2004 reflected the impact of charges totaling $49 million after taxes, or $.17 per diluted share, related to the 2002 BlackRock Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). This LTIP is described under 2002
BlackRock Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan in Item 7 of this Report.

Our performance in 2005 included the
following accomplishments:

•

Total taxable-equivalent revenue for 2005 increased 14% compared with the prior year, driven by continued growth in fee-based businesses and net interest income.

•

Average deposits for the year increased $7.9 billion, or 16%, compared with 2004, driven by higher money market deposits, certificates of deposit and other time deposits as well as
growth in demand deposit balances, including the impact of our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area.

•

Average loans for 2005 increased $6.4 billion, or 16%, compared with 2004, driven by consumer and commercial loan demand, as well as an increase in residential mortgages, and the
impact of our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area.

•

We have begun to realize benefits from the One PNC initiative sooner than originally anticipated and we remain on track to capture $400 million in value from One PNC by 2007.

•

PNC invested more than $1 billion in 2005 to build scale and expand its presence into attractive markets and products. These investments include: expanding into the greater
Washington, D.C. area with our Riggs acquisition; BlackRock’s acquisition of SSRM to build scale; and the addition of Harris Williams.

•

Asset quality remained very strong. Although some ratios increased, all remained at low levels. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans, loans held for sale and foreclosed
assets was .42% at December 31, 2005 compared with .39% at December 31, 2004.

Total average assets were $88.5 billion for 2005 compared with $75.3 billion for 2004. Average
interest-earning assets were $73.0 billion in 2005 compared with $61.8 billion in 2004, an increase of $11.2 billion or 18%. An increase of $6.4 billion in average loans was the primary factor for the increase in average interest-earning assets. In
addition, average total securities increased $3.4 billion in 2005 compared with 2004.

In October 2005, Market Street Funding LLC (“Market
Street”), formerly Market Street Funding Corporation, was restructured as a limited liability company and entered into a subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (“Note”) with an unrelated third party. As a result of the Note issuance, we
reevaluated whether PNC continued to be the primary beneficiary of Market Street under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” (“FIN 46R”). Based on this analysis, we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary and deconsolidated Market Street from our Consolidated Balance Sheet effective October 17, 2005. You can find additional
information on Market Street within the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements And VIEs section of Item 7 of this Report.

Average total loans were $47.4
billion for 2005 and $40.9 billion in 2004. This increase was driven by continued improvements in market loan demand and targeted sales efforts across our banking businesses, as well as the impact of our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C.
area. The increase in average total loans reflected growth in commercial loans of approximately $2.4 billion, consumer loans of approximately $2.0 billion and residential mortgages of approximately $2.1 billion, partially offset by a $.5 billion
decline in lease financing loans. We sold our vehicle leasing business in 2004 as described under the Aircraft and Vehicle Leasing Businesses section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report. Loans represented
65% of average interest-earning assets for 2005 and 66% for 2004.

Average securities totaled $19.3 billion for 2005 and $15.9 billion for 2004. Of this
$3.4 billion increase, $2.5 billion was attributable to increases in mortgage-backed, asset-backed and other debt securities. The increase in 2005 also reflected the impact of Riggs. Securities comprised 26% of average interest-earning assets for
2005 and 2004.

Average total deposits were $57.6 billion for 2005, an increase of $7.9 billion over 2004. The increase in average total deposits was
driven primarily by the impact of higher certificates of deposit, money market account and noninterest-bearing deposit balances, and by higher Eurodollar deposits. The increase in 2005 also reflected the impact of our expansion into the greater
Washington, D.C. area. Average total deposits represented 65% of total sources of funds for 2005 and 66% for 2004. Average transaction deposits were $39.5 billion for 2005 compared with $35.9 billion for 2004.

Average borrowed funds were $16.2 billion for 2005 and $12.5 billion for 2004. The following contributed to this increase:

•

Various issuances of senior and subordinated bank notes and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances throughout 2005, as further detailed within Capital and Funding
Sources in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review, along with the comparative impact of $500 million of subordinated bank notes issued in December 2004 and $500 million of senior bank notes issued in September 2004,

•

The assumption of approximately $345 million of subordinated debt in 2005 with the Riggs acquisition,

•

BlackRock’s issuance of $250 million of convertible debentures in February 2005, and

•

An increase in short-term borrowings to fund asset growth.

These
increases were partially offset by maturing FHLB advances, senior bank notes, and senior and subordinated debt in 2004 and 2005.

Shareholders’ equity
totaled $8.6 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $7.5 billion at December 31, 2004. See the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report for additional information.

IGHLIGHTS

We refer you to Item 1 of this Report for an overview of our business segments in Review of Lines of Business. Total business segment earnings were $1.5 billion for 2005 and $1.3 billion for 2004.

Retail Banking

Retail
Banking’s earnings totaled $682 million for 2005, an increase of $72 million, or 12%, compared with 2004. Continued organic customer growth and the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area drove a growing balance sheet and a
corresponding revenue increase of 6%. A sustained focus on expense management and improving credit quality also contributed to the 12% earnings growth.



Corporate & Institutional Banking

Earnings from Corporate & Institutional Banking were $480 million for 2005 and $443 million for 2004. The 8% increase in earnings compared with 2004 was driven
by balance sheet growth, improved fee income despite significantly lower gains on sales of institutional loans held for sale, and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. Our acquisition of Harris Williams in October 2005 contributed to
increases in both revenues and expenses.

BlackRock

BlackRock reported earnings of $234 million for 2005 and $143 million for 2004. Earnings growth in 2005 was primarily due to performance fees on equity hedge fund and real estate equity alternative products; higher
assets under management primarily as a result of organic growth and the acquisition of SSRM; and an increase in BlackRock Solutions revenue. Earnings for 2005 included $59 million of pretax LTIP expenses and nonrecurring pretax expenses of $9
million associated with the SSRM acquisition. Results for 2004 included a $104 million pretax impact from the LTIP expenses. See the 2002 BlackRock Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan section of Item 7 of this Report for additional
information regarding the BlackRock LTIP. BlackRock’s assets under management totaled $453 billion at December 31, 2005, an increase of 32% compared with the prior year-end level. The increase was attributable to the impact of the SSRM
acquisition, net new subscriptions and market appreciation.

PNC owns approximately 70% of BlackRock and we consolidate BlackRock into our financial
statements. Accordingly, approximately 30% of BlackRock’s earnings are recognized as minority interest expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. BlackRock financial information in Item 7 of this Report is presented on a stand-alone
basis. The market value of our BlackRock shares was approximately $4.8 billion at December 31, 2005, while the book value at that date was approximately $700 million.

PFPC

PFPC earned $104 million for
2005 and $70 million for 2004. The 49% increase in earnings in 2005 was attributable to improved operating leverage and strong performances from custody, securities lending, and managed account services operations, reduced intercompany debt
financing costs, a gain related to the resolution of a client contract dispute in the first quarter of 2005, and tax benefits related to foreign dividends repatriation and changes in state income tax apportionment methods.

PFPC’s accounting/administration net fund assets increased 15% and custody fund assets increased 6% as of December 31, 2005 compared with the balances at
December 31, 2004. The increases were driven by new business and asset inflows from existing customers, as well as comparatively favorable market conditions.

Other

The “Other” net
loss for 2005 was $104 million compared with a net loss of $27 million for 2004. The following factors, on an after-tax basis, contributed to the higher net loss in 2005 within “Other”:

•

Net securities losses in 2005 of $27 million compared with net securities gains of $38 million in 2004;

•

Implementation costs related to the One PNC initiative totaling $35 million in 2005;

•

Riggs acquisition integration costs recognized in 2005 totaling $20 million; and

•

The comparative impact of the first quarter 2004 gain of $22 million from the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts.

Partially offsetting the factors above were the following, on an after-tax basis:

•

The first quarter 2005 benefit of the $45 million deferred tax liability reversal related to the internal transfer of our investment in BlackRock, as referred to above under
“Summary Financial Results”; and

•

The $19 million comparative increase in equity management gains in 2005.

ECONCILIATION

The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal
income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, we also provide net interest income on a
taxable-equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP.

A reconciliation of net interest income as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement (GAAP basis) to net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis follows (in
millions):

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $198 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due to strong growth in
earning assets and deposits. Management expects net interest income to continue to grow and to be higher for full-year 2006 compared with 2005.

The net interest margin was 3.00% for 2005, a decline of 22 basis points
compared with 2004. The following factors contributed to the decline in net interest margin in 2005:

•

An increase in the average rate paid on deposits of 93 basis points for 2005 compared with 2004. The average rate paid on money market accounts, the largest single component of
interest-bearing deposits, increased 130 basis points, reflecting the increases in short-term interest rates that began in mid-2004.

•

An increase in the average rate paid on borrowed funds of 131 basis points for 2005 compared with 2004.

•

By comparison, the yield on interest-earning assets increased 68 basis points.

•

Higher balances of interest-earning trading assets for 2005, which negatively affected the overall yield on interest-earning assets.

The factors above were partially offset by the favorable impact on net interest margin in 2005 of an increase of 15 basis points related to noninterest-bearing sources
of funding. See Consolidated Income Statement Review under the 2004 Versus 2003 section of Item 7 of this Report for further information regarding 2003 taxable-equivalent net interest income and margin.

The provision for credit losses decreased $31 million, to $21 million, for 2005 compared with 2004. The decline in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to the benefit of a $53 million loan recovery in the
second quarter of 2005 resulting from a litigation settlement, in addition to continued strong asset quality. The favorable impact of these factors on the provision was partially offset by the impact of total average loan and loan commitments growth
in 2005 compared with the prior year.

We expect loan and loan commitment growth to continue to impact the provision during 2006. In addition, we do not
expect to sustain asset quality at its current level and we expect a higher provision for credit losses in 2006. However, based on the assets we currently hold and current business trends and activities, we believe that overall asset quality will
remain strong for at least the near term.

See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 for additional information
regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses. Also see Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters of Credit in that Credit Risk Management section for additional information regarding factors

NCOME

Summary

Noninterest income was $4.162 billion for 2005, an
increase of $599 million compared with 2004. Higher asset management fees was the largest factor in the increase, driven largely by BlackRock’s acquisition of SSRM in January 2005 and higher performance fees. In addition, noninterest income in
2005 reflected increases in all other major categories other than net securities losses in 2005 compared with net gains in 2004. We expect that the increase in our ownership in the Merchant Services business and the impact of the Harris Williams
acquisition will have a positive impact on noninterest income in 2006.

Additional analysis

Combined asset management and fund servicing fees amounted to $2.313 billion for 2005 compared with $1.811 billion for 2004. The increase reflected the impact of the
first quarter 2005 SSRM acquisition, higher performance fees at BlackRock, and other growth in assets managed and serviced.



Assets under management at December 31, 2005 totaled $494 billion compared with $383 billion at December 31,
2004. In addition to the impact of net new business during 2005, the acquisition of SSRM added $50 billion of assets under management during the first quarter of 2005. PFPC provided fund accounting/administration services for $830 billion of net
fund assets and provided custody services for $476 billion of fund assets at December 31, 2005, compared with $721 billion and $451 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2004. These increases were driven by net new business and asset
inflows from existing customers, as well as comparatively favorable market conditions.

Service charges on deposits increased $21 million for 2005 compared
with 2004. Although growth in service charges has been limited due to our offering of free checking in both the consumer and small business channels, free checking has positively impacted customer and demand deposit growth as well as other
deposit-related fees.

Brokerage fees increased $6 million, to $225 million, for 2005 compared with the prior year. The increase was primarily due to
higher mutual fund-related revenues in 2005.

Consumer services fees increased $23 million, to $287 million, in 2005 compared with 2004. Higher fees
reflected additional fees from debit card transactions, primarily due to higher volumes and the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area.

Corporate services revenue was $511 million for 2005, compared with $493 million in 2004. Corporate services revenue in 2005 benefited from the impact of higher net gains on commercial mortgage loan sales, higher fees related to commercial
mortgage servicing activities, increased loan syndication fees and higher capital markets revenues, including revenues attributable to Harris Williams, compared with the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a $45 million decline in
2005 of net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to our liquidation of institutional loans held for sale. Our liquidation of institutional loans held for sale is now complete.

Equity management (private equity) net gains on portfolio investments totaled $96 million for 2005 and $67 million for 2004.

Net securities losses amounted to $41 million for 2005 compared with net securities gains of $55 million in 2004. Our discussion under the Consolidated Balance Sheet
Review section of this Item 7 provides additional information on the impact on net securities losses of actions taken during the second quarter of 2005 regarding our securities portfolio.

Noninterest revenue from trading activities totaled $157 million for 2005 and $113 million for 2004. While customer activity represented the majority of trading revenue,
the increase compared with 2004 was primarily the result of proprietary trading activities. We provide additional information on our trading activities under Market Risk Management – Trading Risk in the Risk Management section of this
Item 7.

Other noninterest income increased $52 million, to $341 million, in 2005 compared with 2004. Other noninterest income typically fluctuates
from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed.

Other noninterest income for 2005
included the following pretax items:

•

A $33 million gain related to contributions of BlackRock stock to the PNC Foundation, transactions that also impacted noninterest expense, and

•

Income related to the 2005 SSRM and Riggs acquisitions.

These factors more than offset the impact of the following pretax gains in 2004:

•

A first quarter $34 million gain related to the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts, and

•

A second quarter $13 million gain recognized in connection with BlackRock’s sale of its interest in Trepp LLC, a provider of commercial mortgage-backed security information,
analytics and technology.

Corporate & Institutional Banking offers treasury management and capital markets-related products and services, commercial loan servicing and equipment leasing products that are marketed by several businesses
across PNC.

Treasury management revenue, which includes fees as well as net interest revenue from customer deposit balances, totaled $410 million for 2005
and $373 million for 2004. The 10% increase in revenue reflected the longer-term nature of treasury management deposits along with the rising interest rate environment, strong deposit growth, continued expansion and client utilization of commercial
card services, and a steady increase in business-to-business processing volumes. The acquisition of Riggs also contributed to the revenue growth in 2005.

Revenue from capital markets products and services was $175 million for 2005, compared with $140 million in 2004. The acquisition of Harris Williams and increases in loan syndication fees and other client-related activity drove the 25%
increase in capital markets revenue.

Midland Loan Services offers servicing, real estate advisory and technology solutions for the commercial real estate
finance industry. Midland’s revenue, which includes fees and net interest income from servicing portfolio deposit balances, totaled $131 million for 2005 and $108 million for



2004. The 21% revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in the commercial mortgage servicing portfolio and related
services.

Revenue from equipment leasing products was $69 million for 2005 and $84 million for 2004. The decline was primarily due to the interest cost of
funding the potential tax exposure on the cross-border leasing portfolio. The impact of cross-border leasing is expected to continue to have a negative impact on leasing revenue in 2006. See Cross-Border Leases and Related Tax and Accounting Matters
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7 for further information.

As a component of our advisory services to clients, we
provide a select set of insurance products to fulfill specific customer financial needs. Primary insurance offerings include:

•

Annuities,

•

Life,

•

Credit life,

•

Health,

•

Disability, and

•

Commercial lines coverage.

Client segments served by these insurance
solutions include those in Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking. Insurance products are sold by PNC-licensed insurance agents and through licensed third-party arrangements. We recognized revenue from these products of $61
million in 2005 and $65 million in 2004. The decrease reflected a decline in annuity fee revenue driven primarily by the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts in 2004.

PNC, through subsidiary companies, Alpine Indemnity Limited and PNC Insurance Corp., participates as a reinsurer for its general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation programs and as a direct
writer for its property and certified domestic terrorism programs.

In the normal course of business, PNC Insurance Corp. and Alpine Indemnity Limited
maintain insurance reserves for reported claims and for claims incurred but not reported based on actuarial assessments. We believe these reserves were adequate at December 31, 2005.

Total noninterest
expense was $4.333 billion for 2005, an increase of $598 million compared with 2004. The efficiency ratio was 69% for 2005 and 68% for 2004.

We expect
noninterest expense to be flat in 2006 compared with 2005 except for the increase in our ownership in the Merchant Services business and the impact of the Harris Williams acquisition.

Noninterest expense for 2005 included the following:

•

An increase of $325 million in BlackRock non-LTIP operating expenses that reflected the impact of costs resulting from the first quarter 2005 SSRM acquisition and other investments
to fund growth;

•

Costs totaling approximately $132 million resulting from our Riggs acquisition, including approximately $16 million of integration costs;

•

BlackRock LTIP charges of $64 million;

•

Implementation costs totaling $53 million related to the One PNC initiative;

•

Contributions of BlackRock stock to the PNC Foundation of $40 million; and

•

Costs totaling $17 million related to the Harris Williams acquisition.

The effect of these increases was partially offset by cost reductions of approximately $90 million realized in 2005 from the One PNC initiative. The impact of the Riggs integration and One PNC implementation costs was reflected in several
noninterest expense items in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Noninterest expense for 2004 included a $110 million charge associated with the BlackRock
LTIP and conversion-related and other nonrecurring costs totaling approximately $11 million related to our acquisition of United National Bancorp, Inc.

Apart from the impact of these items, noninterest expense increased $178 million, or 5%, in 2005 compared with 2004. These higher expenses were driven by investments in our businesses and increased sales incentives.

ATE

Our
effective tax rate was 30.8% for both 2005 and 2004. Several factors contributed to a relatively low effective tax rate for each year.

The low effective
rate for 2005 was primarily attributable to the impact of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the transfer of our ownership in BlackRock to our intermediate bank holding company. This transaction reduced our first quarter
2005 tax provision by $45 million, or $.16 per diluted share. See Note 2 Acquisitions in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

The following favorably impacted the effective tax rate for 2004:

•

A reduced state and local tax expense due to tax benefits of $18 million recorded in connection with New York state and city audit findings, primarily associated with BlackRock, and

•

A $14 million reduction in income tax expense following our determination that we no longer required an income tax reserve related to bank-owned life insurance.

We expect the effective tax rate in 2006 to be closer to the statutory tax rate.

The summarized balance sheet data above is based upon our Consolidated Balance
Sheet in Item 8 of this Report.

Higher total assets at December 31, 2005 compared with the prior year-end were driven by loan growth resulting
primarily from continued improvements in market loan demand, higher securities balances that reflected normal portfolio activity, purchases, and the impact of our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area.

An analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows.

NCOME

Loans increased $5.6 billion, or 13%, as of December 31, 2005 compared with December 31, 2004. Improvements in market loan demand, in addition to
targeted sales efforts across our banking businesses, drove the increase in total loans compared with the prior year-end. The impact of our Riggs acquisition added $2.7 billion of loans as of December 31, 2005. Loans at December 31, 2004
included $2.3 billion related to the Market Street conduit that we deconsolidated effective October 17, 2005.

Details Of Loans

As the table above indicates, the loans that we hold continued to be diversified among numerous industries and
types of businesses. The loans that we hold are also diversified across the geographic areas where we do business. See Note 7 Loans, Commitments To Extend Credit and Concentrations of Credit Risk in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

Commercial Lending Exposure (a)

(a)

Includes all commercial loans in the Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking business segments other than the loans of Market Street. We deconsolidated Market
Street from our Consolidated Balance Sheet effective October 17, 2005.

Cross-Border Leases and Related Tax and Accounting Matters

The equipment lease portfolio totaled $3.6 billion at December 31, 2005 and included approximately $1.7 billion of cross-border leases.
Cross-border leases are primarily leveraged leases of equipment located in foreign countries, primarily in western Europe and Australia. We no longer enter into cross-border lease transactions.



Aggregate residual value at risk on the total commercial lease portfolio at December 31, 2005 was $1.1 billion. We
have taken steps to mitigate $.6 billion of this residual risk, including residual value insurance coverage with third parties, third party guarantees, and other actions.

Upon completing examination of our 1998-2000 consolidated federal income tax returns, the IRS provided us with an examination report which proposed increases in our tax liability, principally arising from adjustments
to several of our cross-border lease transactions.

The proposed adjustments would reverse the tax treatment of these transactions as we reported them on
our filed tax returns. We believe the method we used to report these transactions is supported by appropriate tax law and have filed a protest and begun discussions of the IRS examination findings with the IRS appeals office. While we cannot predict
with certainty the result of filing the protest and resultant discussions, any resolution would most likely involve a change in the timing of tax deductions which, in turn, depending on the exact resolution, could significantly impact the economics
of these transactions. The IRS has begun an audit of our 2001-2003 consolidated federal income tax returns. We expect them to again make adjustments to the cross-border lease transactions referred to above as well as to new cross-border lease
transactions entered into during those years. We believe our reserves for these exposures were adequate at December 31, 2005.

In July 2005, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a proposed staff position to consider whether any change in the timing of tax benefits associated with these types of transactions should result in a recalculation under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. (“SFAS”) 13, “Accounting for Leases.” The FASB has had further discussions on this proposal in 2006. The FASB’s current position is that any cumulative adjustment will be recognized through
opening retained earnings in the year of adoption under the provisions of SFAS 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections – a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.” See Note 1 Accounting Policies in
the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on SFAS 154. Assuming that the FASB staff position becomes effective January 1, 2007, we believe that the cumulative adjustment from the
recalculations would be in the range of approximately $140 million to $160 million after-tax. Under the leveraged leasing accounting rules, any immediate or future reductions in earnings from the change in accounting would be recovered in subsequent
years.

In addition to the transactions referred to above, three lease-to-service contract transactions that we were party to were structured as
partnerships for tax purposes. These partnerships are under audit by the IRS. However, we do not believe that our exposure from these transactions is material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Aircraft and Vehicle Leasing Businesses

On September 1, 2004,
we acquired the business of the Aviation Finance Group, LLC (“AFG”), an Idaho-based company that specializes in loans to finance private aircraft. By combining the business of AFG with our existing business, we have increased our ability
to offer a variety of loans and leasing products to corporate aircraft customers. See Note 2 Acquisitions in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the sale of our subsidiary, PNC Vehicle Leasing LLC, and the related vehicle lease portfolio and other assets. In
connection with this transaction, we also terminated our related residual insurance policies with our remaining residual insurance carrier. As a result of these actions, we have completed the exit of the consumer vehicle leasing business, including
our related exposures to the used vehicle market and the payment of future residual insurance claims. We recognized a pretax net loss of $3 million related to this sale during the second quarter of 2004.

Net Unfunded Credit Commitments

Commitments to extend credit represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified
contractual conditions. Commercial commitments are reported net of participations, assignments and syndications, primarily to financial institutions, totaling $6.7 billion at both December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.

As a result of deconsolidating Market Street in October 2005, amounts related to Market Street were considered third party unfunded commitments at December 31,
2005. These unfunded credit commitments totaled $4.6 billion at December 31, 2005 and are included in the preceding table primarily within the “Commercial” and “Consumer” categories. See the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
And Consolidated VIEs section of Item 7 and Note 3 Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further information regarding Market Street.

The remaining increase in consumer net unfunded commitments at December 31, 2005 compared with the balance at December 31, 2004 was primarily due to net
unfunded commitments related to growth in open-ended home equity loans.

In addition to credit commitments, our net outstanding standby letters of credit
totaled $4.2 billion at December 31, 2005 and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2004. Standby letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of our customers if specified future events occur.

ECURITIES

Details Of Securities

(a)

Securities held to maturity at December 31, 2005 were less than $.5 million.

Securities represented 23% of total assets at December 31, 2005 compared with 21% at December 31, 2004. The increase in total securities compared with December 31, 2004 was primarily due to the acquisition of Riggs and normal
portfolio activity.

At December 31, 2005, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of $370 million, which represented
the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2004 was a net unrealized loss of $102 million. The increase in the net unrealized loss at December 31, 2005 reflected the impact on bond prices of
increases in interest rates during 2005 partially offset by the sales of securities during the second quarter of 2005 as discussed below.

We evaluate our
portfolio of securities available for sale in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps intended to improve our overall positioning. In late April and early May 2005 we sold $2.1 billion of securities
available for sale and terminated $1.0 billion of resale agreements that were most sensitive to extension risk due to rising short-term interest rates. We also purchased $2.1 billion of securities with higher yields and lower extension risk. These
transactions resulted in realized net securities and other losses of approximately $31 million, which are included in our results of operations for 2005.

The fair value of securities available for sale decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. Further increases in interest rates in 2006, if sustained, will adversely impact the fair value of securities available for sale going
forward compared with the fair value at December 31, 2005. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in shareholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax.

The expected weighted-average life of securities available for sale was 4 years and 1 month at December 31, 2005 compared with 2 years and 8 months
at December 31, 2004.

We estimate that at December 31, 2005 the effective duration of securities available for sale is 2.7 years for an
immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.4 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2004 were 2.7 years and 2.3 years, respectively.

Education loans held for sale totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2005 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2004 and represented the majority of our loans held for sale at each date. We classify substantially
all of our education loans as loans held for sale. Generally, we sell education loans when the loans are placed into repayment status. Gains on sales of education loans totaled $19 million for 2005, $30 million for 2004 and $20 million for 2003.
These gains are reflected in the other noninterest income line item in our Consolidated Income Statement and in the results of the Retail Banking segment.

Our liquidation of institutional loans held for sale resulted in net gains in excess of valuation adjustments of $7 million in 2005, $52 million in 2004 and $69 million in 2003. These gains are reflected in the corporate services line item
in our Consolidated Income Statement and in the results of the Corporate & Institutional Banking business segment. This liquidation has now been completed.

recorded in connection with the Riggs, SSRM and Harris Williams acquisitions totaled $1.0 billion in 2005. See Note 9 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further
information. In addition, accounts receivable included in other assets increased $.6 billion at December 31, 2005 compared with the prior year-end, due in part to increases at PFPC and BlackRock.

OURCES

(a)

Attributable primarily to Market Street, which was deconsolidated in October 2005.

Various seasonal and other factors impact our period-end deposit balances whereas average balances (discussed under the Balance Sheet Highlights section of this Item 7 above) are more indicative of underlying
business trends. The increase in deposits as of December 31, 2005 reflected sales and retention efforts related to core deposits as well as the impact of our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area.

Higher borrowed funds at December 31, 2005 were driven in part by the following 2005 transactions:

•

Senior bank note issuances of $350 million in March, $500 million in July and $75 million in August,

•

Senior debt issuances of $700 million in March and $400 million in December and BlackRock’s issuance of $250 million of convertible debentures in February,

•

Subordinated bank debt issuance of $500 million in September and the assumption of $345 million of subordinated debt related to the Riggs transaction,

•

$1 billion of FHLB advances issued in June, and

•

Higher short-term borrowings to fund asset growth.

These factors were
partially offset by maturities of $750 million of senior bank notes and $350 million of subordinated debt during 2005.

Capital

We manage our capital position by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt and equity instruments, making treasury stock
transactions, maintaining dividend policies and retaining earnings.

The increase of $1.1 billion in total shareholders’ equity at December 31,
2005 compared with December 31, 2004 primarily reflected the impact of retained earnings of $750 million and the issuance of $356 million of shares in connection with the Riggs acquisition.

Common shares outstanding at December 31, 2005 were 292.9 million, an increase of 10.3 million over December 31, 2004. We issued approximately
6.6 million shares of common stock during the second quarter of 2005 in connection with the Riggs acquisition and approximately .7 million shares during the fourth quarter in connection with the Harris Williams acquisition.

In February 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 20 million shares of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions
through February 2005. The 2004 repurchase authorization was a replacement and continuation of the prior repurchase program. Under these programs, we purchased 3.7 million common shares during 2004 at a total cost of $207 million.

A new program to purchase up to 20 million shares was authorized as of February 16, 2005 and replaced the 2004 program, which was terminated. During 2005,
we purchased .5 million common shares at a total cost of $26 million under both the 2005 and 2004 common stock repurchase programs, all of which occurred during the first quarter.

The 2005 common stock repurchase program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. The extent and timing of additional share repurchases under this program will depend on
a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, and the potential impact on our credit rating. The impact on our capital of asset
growth, including acquisitions, has restricted share repurchases and could continue to do so over the next several quarters although capital growth as a result of earnings and the anticipated consequences of the completion of BlackRock’s
acquisition of Merrill Lynch’s investment management business would increase our flexibility in this area.



Risk-Based Capital

The access to, and cost of, funding new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in
expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on a financial institution’s capital strength. The declines in the capital
ratios at December 31, 2005 compared with the ratios at December 31, 2004 were primarily caused by asset growth and the addition of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the Riggs, SSRM and Harris Williams transactions.

At December 31, 2005, each of our banking subsidiaries was considered “well capitalized” based on regulatory capital ratio requirements.
See the Supervision And Regulation section of Item 1 of this Report and Note 4 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. We believe our bank subsidiaries will
continue to meet these requirements in 2006.

Commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report, and

•

Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

The following provides a summary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”), including those in which we hold a significant variable interest but have not

(a)

Held by BlackRock.

(b)

Includes both PNC’s risk of loss and BlackRock’s risk of loss, limited to PNC’s ownership interest in BlackRock.

(c)

Includes off-balance sheet liquidity commitments to Market Street of $4.6 billion and other credit enhancements of $444 million.

Consolidated VIEs – PNC Is Primary Beneficiary

•

BlackRock is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that may be deemed to be VIEs and may hold interests therein, including investment advisory agreements
and equity securities, which may be considered variable interests. BlackRock engages in these transactions principally to address client needs through the launch of collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) and private investment funds.
BlackRock has not been deemed the primary beneficiary of these entities. Additional information about BlackRock is available in its SEC filings, which can be found at www.sec.gov and on BlackRock’s website, www.blackrock.com.

•

Market Street is a multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduit that is owned by an independent third party. Market Street’s activities are limited to the purchasing of
assets or making of loans secured by interests primarily in pools of receivables from US corporations that desire access to the commercial paper market. Market Street funds the purchases or loans by issuing commercial paper which has been rated
A1/P1 by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively, and is supported by pool-specific credit enhancement, liquidity facilities and program-level credit enhancement.

PNC Bank, N.A. provides certain administrative services, a portion of the program-level credit enhancement and the majority of liquidity facilities to
Market Street in exchange for fees negotiated based on market rates. Credit enhancement is provided in part by PNC Bank, N.A. in the form of a cash collateral account that is funded by a loan facility that expires March 25, 2010. See Note 7
Loans, Commitments To Extend Credit and Concentrations of Credit Risk and Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. PNC views its credit exposure to
Market Street transactions as



limited. All of Market Street’s assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004 collateralize the
commercial paper obligations. For the most part, PNC is not required to fund under the liquidity facilities if Market Street’s assets are in default. Our obligations are secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the sellers or another
third party. Neither creditors nor equity investors in Market Street have any recourse to our general credit. PNC received program administrator fees and commitment fees related to PNC’s portion of the liquidity facilities of $9.5 million and
$3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (“FIN 46”), we consolidated Market Street effective July 1, 2003 as we were deemed the primary beneficiary of Market Street. In October 2005, Market Street was restructured as a
limited liability company and entered into a subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (“Note”) with an unrelated third party. The principal amount of the Note was increased to $4.6 million by December 31, 2005 and has an original maturity
of eight years. The Note bears interest at 18% with any penalty interest/fees charged by Market Street on specific transactions accruing to the benefit of the Note holder. Proceeds from the issuance of the Note were placed in a first loss reserve
account that may be used to reimburse any losses incurred by Market Street, PNC Bank, N.A. or other providers under the liquidity facilities and the credit enhancement arrangements. As a result of the Note issuance, we reevaluated whether PNC
continued to be the primary beneficiary of Market Street under the provisions of FIN 46R. Based on this analysis, we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary and deconsolidated Market Street from our Consolidated Balance Sheet
effective October 17, 2005.

•

We make certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) pursuant
to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings and to assist us in achieving goals
associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types
of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity, with equity typically comprising 30% to 60% of the total project capital.

We consolidated those LIHTC investments in which we own a majority of the limited partnership interests. We also consolidated entities in which we, as a national syndicator of affordable housing equity, serve as the
general partner (together with the aforementioned LIHTC investments), and no other entity owns a majority of the limited partnership interests. In these syndication transactions, we create funds in which our subsidiary is the general partner and
sells limited partnership interests to third parties, and in some cases may also purchase a limited partnership interest in the fund. The fund’s limited partners can generally remove the general partner without cause at any time. The purpose of
this business is to generate income from the syndication of these funds and to generate servicing fees by managing the funds. General partner activities include selecting, evaluating, structuring, negotiating, and closing the fund investments in
operating limited partnerships, as well as oversight of the ongoing operations of the fund portfolio. The assets are primarily included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Neither creditors nor equity investors in the LIHTC
investments have any recourse to our general credit. The consolidated aggregate assets and debt of these LIHTC investments are provided in the Consolidated VIEs – PNC Is Primary Beneficiary table and reflected in the Corporate &
Institutional Banking business segment.

We have a significant variable interest in certain other limited partnerships that sponsor
affordable housing projects. We do not own a majority of the limited partnership interests in these entities and are not the primary beneficiary. We use the equity method to account for our investment in these entities. Information regarding these
partnership interests is reflected in the Non-Consolidated VIEs – Significant Variable Interests table.

We also have subsidiaries that invest in and
act as the investment manager for a private equity fund that is organized as a limited partnership as part of our equity management activities. The fund invests in private equity investments to generate capital appreciation and profits. As permitted
by FIN 46R, we have deferred applying the provisions of the interpretation for this entity pending further action by the FASB. Information on this entity follows:

third quarter of 2005 we reorganized our banking businesses into two units, Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking, and aligned our reporting accordingly.

Our treasury management activities, which include cash and investment management, receivables management, disbursement services, funds transfer services, information reporting, and global trade services; capital
markets products and services, which include foreign exchange, derivatives, loan syndications, securities underwriting, securities sales and trading, and mergers and acquisitions advisory and related services to middle-market companies; commercial
loan servicing, real estate advisory and technology solutions for the commercial real estate finance industry; and equipment leasing products are offered through Corporate & Institutional Banking and marketed by several businesses across
PNC.

Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and our operating structure. There is no comprehensive,
authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We refine our methodologies from
time to time as our management accounting practices are enhanced and our businesses and management structure change. Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis. As permitted under
GAAP, we have aggregated the business results for certain operating segments for financial reporting purposes.

Our capital measurement methodology is
based on the concept of economic capital. However, we have increased the capital assigned to certain business segments. Capital assigned to Retail Banking has been increased to 6% of funds to reflect the capital required for well-capitalized banks
and to approximate market comparables for this business. The capital for BlackRock and PFPC has been increased to reflect their legal entity shareholders’ equity. BlackRock’s capital is consistent with its separate public company financial
statement disclosures.

We have allocated the allowance for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on our
assessment of risk inherent in the loan portfolios. Our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services.

Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated results. The impact of these differences is primarily reflected in minority interest in income of
BlackRock and in the “Other” category in the Results of Businesses – Summary table that follows. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as
asset and liability management activities, related net securities gains or losses, certain trading activities, equity management activities, differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP),
corporate overhead and intercompany eliminations.

Business segment results, including inter-segment revenues, are included in Note 21 Segment Reporting in
the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Employee data as reported by each business segment in the tables that follow
reflect staff directly employed by the respective businesses and excludes corporate and shared services employees. Prior period employee statistics generally are not restated for organizational changes.

Results Of Businesses - Summary

(a)

Business segment revenue is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis. The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such,
these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, we also provide revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis by increasing the
interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of total consolidated revenue on a book (GAAP)
basis to total consolidated revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (in millions):

Retail Banking’s earnings increased $72 million, or 12%, for 2005 compared with 2004. Continued organic customer
growth and the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area drove a growing balance sheet and a corresponding revenue increase of 6%. A sustained focus on expense management and improving credit quality also contributed to the 12% earnings
growth.

Highlights of Retail Banking’s performance during 2005 include:

•

Consumer and small business checking relationships increased by 172,000, or 10%, compared with December 31, 2004.

•

Consumer-related new checking relationships increased 10%, average consumer demand deposits increased 7% and home equity loans increased 15% compared with the comparable prior year
amounts.

•

The small business area continued its positive momentum with strong customer and balance sheet growth. Average small business loans increased 19% over 2004 on the strength of
increased demand from both existing customers and new relationships. Small business deposits increased 6% over the same period and new checking relationships increased 8%.

•

The wealth management business sustained solid growth over 2004 as asset management fees increased $20 million as a result of pricing enhancements, certain one-time fees and the
expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. Assets under management totaled $49 billion at December 31, 2005 compared with $50 billion at December 31, 2004.

•

Our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area in the second quarter of 2005 has resulted in solid growth, with checking relationships increasing by 11% during the last six
months of 2005.

•

In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the acquisition of an additional 20% interest in our Merchant Services business from First Data. This transaction gives us a 60%
ownership interest and positions us to take advantage of the payment revenue sources from small business customers. Results of this business are now consolidated in our financial statements.

•

Noninterest expense increased $44 million compared with 2004 and reflected the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. Retail Banking’s efficiency ratio improved to
60% compared with 62% a year earlier.

•

Credit quality remained strong and stable. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loan outstandings were .23% for 2005 compared with .32% in 2004.

Total revenue for 2005 was $2.857 billion compared with $2.694 billion for the same period last year. Taxable-equivalent net interest income of $1.582 billion increased
$111 million, or 8%, compared with 2004 due to a 10% increase in average deposits and a 14% increase in average loan balances. The net interest income growth has been somewhat mitigated by a narrower spread between loan yields and deposit costs.

Noninterest income increased $52 million, or 4%, compared with 2004 primarily driven by increased asset management revenue, service charges on deposits
and consumer service fees. Growth in the latter two areas can be attributed mainly to a growing customer base. Increases in noninterest income were partially offset by:

•

A decrease in gains from sales of education loans of $11 million compared with 2004;

•

A $10 million pretax gain from the sale of certain investment consulting activities of Hawthorn recognized in 2004; and

•

Lower ATM surcharge revenue in 2005 from changing customer behaviors and a strategic decision to reduce the out-of-footprint ATM network.

The provision for credit losses declined $9 million in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due to a one-time impact in the first quarter of 2004 associated with the
decision to change the charge-off policy related to smaller nonperforming commercial loans. Overall credit quality remained strong as evidenced by the decline in nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans to .33% as of December 31, 2005
compared with .41% at the same time last year. We expect that the provision for credit losses will increase with loan growth. We have not been and we do not expect to be materially impacted by the recent changes in the federal bankruptcy laws.

Noninterest expense in 2005 totaled $1.715 billion, an increase of $44 million, or 3%, compared with 2004. Retail Banking incurred approximately $74
million in operating costs as a result of the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area in 2005 and recognized $11 million in nonrecurring costs in 2004 associated with the United National acquisition. Excluding the impact of these expenses,
noninterest expense declined $19 million compared with 2004. This decline was reflected primarily in staff expense as a result of One PNC initiatives.

Full-time employees at December 31, 2005 totaled 11,703, a decline of 97 from December 31, 2004. The expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area accounted for an increase in full-time employees of 621 at December 31,
2005. Excluding the impact of this expansion on full-time employees, the number of Retail Banking full-time employees at December 31, 2005 declined 6% compared with December 31, 2004.

We have adopted a relationship-based lending strategy to target specific customer sectors (homeowners, small businesses and auto dealerships) while seeking to maintain a
moderate risk profile in the loan portfolio.

•

Average home equity loans grew by $1.7 billion, or 15%, compared with 2004. The increase was attributable to $1.3 billion from organic loan growth, $.3 billion from expansion into
the greater Washington, D.C. area and $.1 billion from portfolio purchases. Consumer loan demand is starting to slow as a result of the rising rate environment.

•

Average commercial loans grew 14% on the strength of increased loan demand from existing small business customers and the acquisition of new relationships through our sales efforts.
New loan volume in the small business arena increased 16% over 2004.



•

Average residential mortgage loans increased $517 million, or 58%, primarily due to the addition of loans from the greater Washington, D.C. area acquisition. Payoffs in our existing
portfolio, which will continue throughout 2006, reduced the impact of the additional loans acquired.

Growing core checking deposits as a
lower cost-funding source and as the cornerstone product to build customer relationships are primary objectives of our deposit strategy. Average total deposits increased $3.9 billion, or 10%, compared with 2004. The deposit growth was driven by
increases in the number of checking relationships (new customer acquisition and the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area) and the recapture of consumer certificate of deposit balances as interest rates have risen.

During this rising rate environment, we expect the rate of growth in demand deposit balances to be less than the rate of growth for customer checking relationships.
Additionally, we expect to see customers shift their funds from lower interest-bearing deposits to higher yielding deposits or investment products. The shift was evident during the second half of 2005 and impacted the level of average demand
deposits in that period. Higher energy costs to consumers could also have a negative impact on demand deposit balance growth.

•

Average demand deposit growth of $909 million, or 6%, was driven by a $229 million increase in the core business due to continued growth in total checking relationships and $680
million attributable to the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area.

•

Small business checking relationship retention has improved. Consumer checking relationship retention remains steady and strong due to increased penetration rates of debit card,
online banking and online bill payment.

•

Customer balances in other deposit products remained consistent while certificates of deposits increased $2.5 billion. This increase was attributable to the rising interest rate
environment attracting customers back into this product.

Assets under management of $49 billion at December 31, 2005 declined $1
billion compared with the balance at December 31, 2004. The effects of comparatively higher equity markets and the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area were more than offset by net client asset outflows. Net client asset outflows
are the result of ordinary course distributions from trust and investment management accounts and account closures exceeding investment additions from new and existing clients. The net outflows were primarily related to a few significant low-margin
clients.

Nondiscretionary assets under administration of $84 billion at December 31, 2005 declined $9 billion compared with the balance at
December 31, 2004. The decline primarily reflects the loss of two sizeable master custody accounts with minimal earnings impact.

Earnings from Corporate & Institutional Banking for 2005 increased $37 million, or 8%, compared with the prior year. The increase in earnings compared with 2004
was driven by balance sheet growth and improved fee income. The impact of significantly lower net gains on sales of institutional loans held for sale was partially offset by a reduction in the provision for credit losses. While our acquisition of
Harris Williams in October 2005 contributed to increases in both revenues and expenses in the fourth quarter, the impact on earnings for 2005 was not significant.

Highlights for Corporate & Institutional Banking’s 2005 results included:

•

Average loan balances increased $2.1 billion, or 12%, over 2004, including the impact of the deconsolidation of the Market Street conduit. While usage has remained relatively
constant year over year, growth was driven by continued strong customer demand and PNC’s expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. Growth in all loan categories fueled the increase in outstandings.

•

Average deposits increased $1.9 billion, or 25%, compared with 2004, driven by sales of treasury management products, growth in our commercial mortgage servicing portfolio and
related deposits, and continued strong liquidity positions within our customer base.

•

Total revenue increased $71 million, or 6%, compared with 2004 due to higher taxable-equivalent net interest income and strong growth in noninterest income despite a $45 million
decline in net gains on institutional loans held for sale.

•

Noninterest expense increased $51 million, or 8%, compared with the prior year primarily due to expenses related to acquisition activity and customer growth, as well as an increase
in expenses associated with consolidated LIHTC investments.

•

Operating leverage improved in 2005 driven by the growth in revenue and a focus on controlling costs.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2005 increased $34 million, or 5%, compared with 2004 primarily as a result of higher loan balances funded mainly by higher deposits. The impact of the deconsolidation of
Market Street effective October 17, 2005, the interest cost of funding the potential tax exposure on the cross-border leasing portfolio, and a refined method of accounting for loan origination fees and costs partially offset these factors.
Based on market conditions, we expect a slower rate of loan growth in future periods. We also expect growth in deposits to continue in the near term.

The
provision for credit losses was a $30 million credit in 2005 compared with a $5 million provision for 2004. The negative provision for 2005 resulted primarily from a $53 million loan recovery in the second quarter of 2005. The increase in
nonperforming assets over prior year-end is attributable primarily to an increase in nonaccrual asset-based loans. Based on the assets we currently hold and current business trends and activities, we believe that overall asset quality will remain
strong at least for the near term. However, we anticipate that the provision for credit losses will increase in future quarters.



Noninterest income for 2005 increased $37 million, or 6%, compared with 2004 primarily due to higher fees from our
commercial mortgage servicing, treasury management, and capital markets products and services, including Harris Williams services, and higher net gains on commercial mortgage loans sales. These increases were partially offset by a $45 million
decrease in net gains on institutional loans held for sale. The liquidation of institutional loans held for sale is complete.

Noninterest expense for 2005
increased 8% compared with 2004 primarily as a result of higher staff and related expenses. Higher expenses were associated with the Harris Williams acquisition, our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area, higher compensation costs
associated with customer and revenue growth and a 20% increase in expenses associated with consolidated LIHTC investments.

Earnings at BlackRock increased $91 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Earnings growth in 2005 was primarily due to higher assets under management primarily as a result
of organic growth and the acquisition of SSRM; performance fees on equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSRM acquisition; and an increase in BlackRock Solutions

®

revenue. Earnings for 2005 included $59 million of pretax LTIP expenses and
nonrecurring pretax expenses of $9 million associated with the SSRM acquisition. Results for 2004 included a $104 million pretax impact from the LTIP expenses. Results for 2004 also included the sale of BlackRock’s equity interest in Trepp LLC
and the impact of $18 million of income tax benefits resulting from the resolution of New York state and city tax audit findings.

Total operating revenue
increased 64% compared with 2004 primarily due to a $385 million increase in investment advisory and administrative fees driven by increased assets under management totaling $453 billion at December 31, 2005, including $50 billion assumed in
the SSRM acquisition.

Total expense increased 52% in 2005 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of higher staffing levels following the SSRM
acquisition, higher incentive compensation expense and higher general and administration expense. General and administration expense rose in the comparison primarily due to an increase in marketing and promotional costs, a rise in occupancy expense
with the assumption of additional office space through the SSRM acquisition, and an increase in portfolio services costs related to supporting higher asset under management levels and increased trading activities.

Assets under management at December 31, 2005 increased $111 billion, or 32%, compared with December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to net
new business and the SSRM acquisition. Apart from the impact of the SSRM acquisition, the increase in assets under management in 2005 reflected net new subscriptions of $50 billion and market appreciation of $11 billion.

BlackRock continued to operate in a global marketplace characterized by substantial volatility during 2005. Increasing short-term interest rates, a flattening of the
yield curve and volatility in global equity and commodities markets created challenging conditions across BlackRock’s asset classes.

On
February 15, 2006, we announced that BlackRock and Merrill Lynch had entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Merrill Lynch will contribute its investment management business to BlackRock in exchange for newly issued BlackRock
common and preferred stock. Upon the closing of this transaction, which we expect to occur on or around September 30, 2006, BlackRock’s assets under management will increase to almost $1 trillion and Merrill Lynch will own an approximate
49% economic interest in BlackRock. We will continue to own approximately 44.5 million shares of BlackRock common stock, representing an ownership interest of approximately 34%. This transaction must be approved by BlackRock shareholders and is
subject to obtaining appropriate regulatory and other approvals. We currently control more than 80% of the voting interest in BlackRock and will vote our interest in support of the transaction.

Additional information on this transaction is included in Note 26 Subsequent Event in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, in our Current
Reports on Form 8-K filed February 15, 2006 and February 22, 2006, and in BlackRock’s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed February 15, 2006 and February 22, 2006.

PFPC

(c)

At December 31.

(d)

Includes alternative investment net assets serviced.

PFPC earnings for
2005 increased $34 million, or 49%, compared with 2004. The higher earnings for 2005 were attributable to overall improved operating leverage and strong contributions to operating income from custody, securities lending, and managed account services
operations, reduced intercompany debt financing costs, a gain related to the resolution of a client contract dispute in the first quarter of 2005, and tax benefits related to both foreign dividends repatriation and changes in state income tax
apportionment methods.

Highlights of PFPC’s performance in 2005 include:

•

Managed account services continued to grow its client base as assets increased 74%, to $51 billion, compared with 2004.

•

Alternative investment net assets serviced were $78 billion at December 31, 2005, a 74% increase from 2004, reflecting continued success in pursuing hedge fund and other
alternative investment business.

•

Offshore revenues increased 25% and assets serviced offshore increased 26% compared with 2004 reflecting continued strong offshore sales performance.

Operating revenue increased $75 million, or 9%, over the prior year reflecting continued business expansion of our existing clients, new business wins, and comparatively
favorable equity market conditions. Increases related to out-of-pocket and pass-through items of $11 million had no impact on earnings.

In January 2005
PFPC accepted approximately $10 million to resolve a client contract dispute, which is reflected as other revenue in the table.

Operating expense
increased 4% in 2005 compared with 2004 and reflected a sustained focus on managing expenses to achieve improved operating margins in an increasingly competitive environment. Of this increase, $11 million represented out-of-pocket and pass-through
items referred to above.

Operating income for 2004 benefited from accretion of $11 million related to a single discounted client contract liability which
ended during the second quarter of 2004.

Earnings for 2005 benefited from a reduction in pretax financing costs of $16 million, attributable to the debt
refinancing discussed below and the retirement of debt during 2004 totaling $115 million. PFPC repaid another $160 million in intercompany debt during 2005 and anticipates continued debt reductions in 2006.

Effective January 2005, PFPC restructured its remaining intercompany term debt obligations given the comparatively favorable interest rate environment at that time. PFPC
recorded debt prepayment penalties totaling $8 million on a pretax basis in the first quarter of 2005 to effect the restructuring, which was more than offset by resulting interest expense savings. This cost is reflected as nonoperating expense in
the table above.

Increases in both accounting/administration and custody fund assets at December 31, 2005 compared with December 31, 2004
resulted primarily from new business and asset inflows from existing customers. Subaccounting shareholder accounts serviced by PFPC increased over the year-earlier period due to net new business and growth in existing client accounts. Transfer
agency shareholder accounts declined compared with the balance at December 31, 2004 primarily resulting from lost business due to client consolidations. Total fund assets serviced by PFPC amounted to $1.9 trillion at December 31, 2005
compared with $1.8 trillion at December 31, 2004.

UDGMENTS

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject
to variations that may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.

We must use estimates,
assumptions, and judgments when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility.
Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such third-party
information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial
condition and results of operations.

Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit

We maintain allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at levels that we believe to be adequate to absorb estimated probable
credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We determine the adequacy of the allowances based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires
material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change, including, among others:

•

Expected default probabilities,

•

Exposure at default,

•

Loss given default,

•

Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans,

•

Value of collateral,

•

Estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and

•

Amounts for changes in economic conditions and potential estimation or judgmental errors.

In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, we make specific allocations to impaired loans, to pools of watchlist and nonwatchlist loans and to consumer and residential mortgage loans. We
also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not covered in specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies related to qualitative and measurement factors. While allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans, the
total reserve is available for all credit losses.

Commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are the most sensitive to changes in
assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We have allocated approximately $489 million, or 82%, of the total allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2005 to the commercial
loan category. Consumer and residential mortgage loan allocations are made at a total portfolio level based on historical loss experience adjusted for portfolio activity. Approximately $31 million, or 5.2%, of the total allowance for loan and lease
losses at December 31, 2005 have been allocated to these loans. The remainder of the allowance is allocated primarily to commercial real estate and lease financing loans.

To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future earnings. See the following for additional information: Allowances For Loan And
Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit in the Credit Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report, Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 8 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements, and
Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses in the Statistical Information section in Item 8 of this Report.

Private Equity Asset
Valuation

At December 31, 2005, private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $449 million compared with $470 million at
December 31, 2004. We value private equity assets at each balance sheet date based primarily on either, in the case of limited partnership investments, the financial statements received from the general partner or, for direct investments, the
estimated fair value of the investments. There is a time lag in our receipt of the financial information that is the primary basis for the valuation of our limited partnership interests. We recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005 valuation changes
related to limited partnership investments that reflected the impact of third quarter 2005 market conditions and performance of the underlying companies.

Due to the nature of the direct investments, we must make assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among others, to determine the estimated fair value of the
investments. The valuation procedures that we apply to direct investments include techniques such as cash flow multiples for the entity, independent appraisals of the value of the entity or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing
transaction.

We value affiliated partnership interests based on the underlying investments of the partnership utilizing procedures consistent with those
applied to direct investments.



We reflect changes in the value of equity management investments in our results of operations. Market conditions and
actual performance of the companies that we invest in could differ from these assumptions, resulting in lower valuations that could reduce earnings in future periods. Accordingly, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be
realized from these investments.

Lease Residuals

We provide financing for various types of equipment, aircraft, energy and power systems, and rolling stock through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual
value of the leased property, less unearned income. Residual value insurance or guarantees by governmental entities cover a significant portion of the residual value. Residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying
equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party, or otherwise insured against, we bear the risk
of ownership of the leased assets. This includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value, which could result in an impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future.
These residual values are reviewed for impairment no less than on an annual basis. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

Goodwill

Goodwill arising from business acquisitions
represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the fund servicing, Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking businesses. The
value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and international basis. We also rely upon continuing investments in processing
systems, the development of value-added service features, and the ease of access to our services.

As such, goodwill value is supported ultimately by
earnings, which is driven by the volume of business transacted and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. Lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our
inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a charge and reduced earnings in the future. At least annually, management evaluates events or changes in circumstances
that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 9 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional
information.

Revenue Recognition

We derive net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including:

•

Lending,

•

Securities portfolio,

•

Investment management and fund servicing,

•

Customer deposits,

•

Loan servicing,

•

Brokerage services,

•

Sale of loans and securities,

•

Certain private equity activities, and

•

Securities and derivatives trading activities including foreign exchange.

We also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, selling various insurance products, providing treasury management services and mergers and acquisitions advisory and
related services and participating in certain capital markets transactions.

The timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent
on estimates, judgments, assumptions, and interpretation of contractual terms. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products, market conditions or industry norms. See Note 1
Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

Income Taxes

Because our ownership interest in BlackRock, as measured by value, is less than 80%, federal tax law requires us to file two consolidated federal
income tax returns: one for PNC and subsidiaries excluding the consolidated results of BlackRock and its subsidiaries, and a second return solely for BlackRock and its subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries also file state and local income tax
returns in many jurisdictions.

In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or
subject to varying interpretations. In addition, filing requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations.

We evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculations
after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits. The result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an
estimate. We and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. In the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in
which we resolve the matter.

Our tax treatment of certain leasing transactions is currently being challenged by the IRS, as described in greater detail in
Cross-Border Leases and Related Tax and Accounting Matters in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report.

Legal
Contingencies

We are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, including those described in Note 5 Legal Proceedings in
the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and others arising in the normal course of our business. We review these matters with internal and external legal counsel and establish reserves when we determine that it
is probable that a



liability has been incurred and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly review and adjust the
reserves as appropriate to reflect changes in the status of the proceedings and claims.

The reserves that we establish for these types of contingencies
are based upon our opinion regarding the future outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims at the time. The final resolution of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims is frequently different, possibly significantly, from the
resolution we anticipated. Also, we may not be able to reasonably estimate a potential loss from a proceeding even if some liability is probable and an actual loss is later incurred. As a result, our ultimate financial exposure to legal and
regulatory proceedings and claims may be substantially different from what is reflected in the related reserves.

See Note 18 Stock-Based Compensation Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a description of BlackRock’s LTIP.

Under the BlackRock LTIP, awards vest at the end of any three-month period beginning on or after January 1, 2005 and ending on or prior to March 30, 2007
during which the average closing price of BlackRock’s common stock is at least $62 per share. During the first quarter of 2005, BlackRock’s average closing stock price exceeded the $62 threshold and the stock price provision was met. In
addition to the stock price threshold, the vesting of awards is contingent on the participants’ continued employment with BlackRock for periods ranging from two to five years through the payment date in early 2007.

We reported pretax charges in 2004 totaling $110 million in connection with the LTIP, including $96 million in the third quarter, based upon management’s
determination during the third quarter of 2004 that the likelihood of vesting of the LTIP awards was probable of reaching the stock price threshold. These amounts included a pro rata share of the estimated dilution of our investment in BlackRock
that is expected to occur in 2007 when we transfer shares of BlackRock stock owned by PNC to fund a portion of the LTIP awards.

We reported pretax expense
of $64 million in 2005, including $16 million during the fourth quarter, related to the LTIP awards.

We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (“plan” or “pension plan”) covering eligible
employees. Retirement benefits are derived from a cash balance formula based on compensation levels, age and length of service. Pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan
participants. Plan assets are currently approximately 60% invested in equity investments with most of the remainder invested in fixed income instruments. Plan fiduciaries determine and review the plan’s investment policy.

We calculate the expense associated with the pension plan in accordance with SFAS 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,” and we use assumptions and
methods that are compatible with the requirements of SFAS 87, including a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value. On an annual basis, we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan, including the discount rate,
rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets. Neither the discount rate nor the compensation increase assumptions significantly affect pension expense.

The expected long-term return on assets assumption does significantly affect pension expense. We intend to decrease the expected long-term return on plan assets assumption from the 8.5% used for 2005 to 8.25% for
determining net periodic cost for 2006. Also, under current accounting rules, the difference between expected long-term returns and actual returns are accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods. Each one percentage point
difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes expense in the following year to change by up to $3 million.

The table below reflects
the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in assumptions, using 2006 estimated expense as a baseline.

Change in Assumption

Estimated

Increase to 2006

Pension Expense

(In millions)

We currently estimate a pretax pension benefit of $1 million in 2006 compared with a pretax benefit of $8 million
in 2005.

In accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 132 (Revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,”
we may have to eliminate any prepaid pension asset and recognize a minimum pension liability if the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets at year-end. We would recognize the corresponding charge as a component of other
comprehensive income and it would reduce total shareholders’ equity, but it would not affect net income. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of plan assets was $1.627 billion, which exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation of $1.232
billion. The status at year-end 2006 will depend primarily upon 2006 investment returns and the level of contributions, if any, we make to the plan during 2006.

Plan asset investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements. However, contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions. Investment performance will drive the amount of permitted
contributions in future years. Also, current law sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan. In any event, any large near-term contributions to the plan will be at our discretion, as we expect that the minimum required
contributions under the law will be minimal or zero for several years.

During the second quarter of 2005, we acquired a frozen defined benefit pension
plan as a result of the Riggs acquisition. Plan assets and projected benefit obligations of the Riggs plan were approximately $107 million and $116 million, respectively, at acquisition date. The $9 million funding deficit was recognized as part of
the Riggs acquisition purchase price allocation. For determining contribution amounts to the plan, deficits are calculated using ERISA-mandated rules, and on this basis we contributed approximately $16 million to the Riggs plan during the third
quarter of 2005. We integrated the Riggs plan into the PNC plan on December 30, 2005.

We maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less
significant effect on financial results, including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees. See Note 17 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for
additional information.

We encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. This Risk Management section first provides an overview of the risk measurement,
control strategies, and monitoring aspects of our corporate-level risk management processes. Following that discussion is an analysis of the risk management process for what we view as our primary areas of risk: credit, operational, liquidity, and
market. The discussion of market risk is further subdivided into interest rate, trading, and equity and other investment risk areas. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also
addressed within the Risk Management section of this Item 7. In appropriate places within this section, historical performance is also addressed.

O

VERVIEW

As a financial services organization, we take a certain amount of risk in every business decision. For
example, every time we open an account or approve a loan for a customer, process a payment, hire a new employee, or implement a new computer system, we incur a certain amount of risk. As an organization, we must balance revenue generation and
profitability with the risks associated with our business activities. Risk management is not about eliminating risks, but about identifying and accepting risks and then effectively managing them so to optimize shareholder value.



The key to effective risk management is to be proactive in identifying, measuring, evaluating, and monitoring risk on an
ongoing basis. Risk management practices support decision-making, improve the success rate for new initiatives, and strengthen the organization.

We support risk
management through a governance structure involving the Board, senior management and a corporate risk management organization.

Although our Board as a
whole is responsible generally for oversight of risk management, committees of the Board provide oversight to specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure.

We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. The Executive Risk Management Committee
(“ERMC”), consisting of senior management executives, provides oversight for the establishment and implementation of new comprehensive risk management initiatives, reviews enterprise level risk profiles and discusses key risk issues.

The corporate risk management organization has the following key roles:

•

Facilitate the identification, assessment and monitoring of risk across PNC,

•

Provide support and oversight to the businesses, and

•

Identify and implement risk management best practices, as appropriate.

Risk Measurement

We conduct risk measurement activities specific to each area of risk. The primary vehicle for aggregation of
enterprise-wide risk is a comprehensive risk management methodology that is based on economic capital. This primary risk aggregation measure is supplemented with secondary measures of risk to arrive at an estimate of enterprise-wide risk. The
economic capital framework is a measure of potential losses above and beyond expected losses. Potential one year losses are capitalized to a level commensurate with a financial institution with an A rating by the credit rating agencies. Economic
capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses (Credit Risk), fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments (Market Risk), failure of people, processes or systems (Operational Risk), and income losses
associated with declining volumes, margins and/or fees, and the fixed cost structure of the business (Business Risk). We estimate credit and market risks at an exposure level while we estimate the remaining risk types at an institution or business
segment level. We routinely compare the output of our economic capital model with industry benchmarks.

Risk Control Strategies

We centrally manage policy development and exception oversight through corporate-level risk management. Corporate risk management is authorized to take
action to either prevent or mitigate exceptions to policies and is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk management policies. The Corporate Audit function performs an independent assessment of the internal control environment. Corporate
Audit plays a critical role in risk management, testing the operation of the internal control system and reporting findings to management and to the Audit Committee of the Board.

Risk Monitoring

Corporate risk management reports on a regular basis to our Board regarding the enterprise
risk profile of the Corporation. These reports aggregate and present the level of risk by type of risk and communicate significant risk issues, including performance relative to risk tolerance limits. Both the Board and the ERMC provide guidance on
actions to address key risk issues as identified in these reports.

Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in
accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions. Credit risk is one of the most
common risks in banking and is one of our most significant risks.

Approved risk tolerances, in addition to credit policies and procedures, set portfolio
objectives for the level of credit risk. We have established guidelines for acceptable levels of total borrower exposure, problem loans, and other credit measures. We seek to achieve our credit portfolio objectives by maintaining a customer base
that is diverse in borrower exposure and industry types. We use loan participations with third parties, loan sales and syndications, and the purchase of credit derivatives to reduce risk concentrations.

The credit granting businesses maintain direct responsibility for monitoring credit risk within PNC. The Corporate Credit Policy area provides independent oversight to
the measurement, monitoring and reporting of our credit risk and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. Corporate Audit also provides an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the credit risk management process and adequacy of credit risk
profile.



Nonperforming, Past Due And Potential Problem Assets

See the Nonperforming Assets And Related Information table in the Statistical Information section of Item 8 of this Report and included here by reference for details
of the types of nonperforming assets that we held at December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In addition, certain performing assets have interest payments that are past due or have the potential for future repayment problems.

Total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2005 increased $41 million, to $216 million, compared with the prior year-end primarily due to an increase in
nonaccrual asset-based loans.

Foreclosed lease assets at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 primarily represent our repossession of
collateral related to a single airline industry credit. This repossessed collateral is currently leased to a third party.

The amount of nonperforming
loans that was current as to principal and interest was $115 million at December 31, 2005 and $44 million at December 31, 2004. We anticipate an increase in nonperforming loans going forward as we do not expect to sustain asset quality at
its current level. However, based on the assets we currently hold and current business trends and activities, we believe that overall asset quality will remain strong at least for the near term.

Nonperforming Assets By Business

Change In Nonperforming Assets

Accruing Loans And Loans Held For Sale Past Due 90 Days Or More

Loans and loans held for sale that are not included in nonperforming or past due categories but cause us to be
uncertain about the borrower’s ability to comply with existing repayment terms over the next six months totaled $67 million and zero, respectively, at December 31, 2005, compared with $65 million and zero, respectively, at
December 31, 2004. Approximately 89% of these loans are in the Corporate & Institutional Banking portfolio.

Allowances For Loan And
Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit

We maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level we believe to be
adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. While we make allocations to specific
loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all loan and lease losses.

In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we
maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses
related to those credit exposures. This methodology is similar to the methodology we use for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses.

We refer you to Note 8 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of
credit, and to the Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses table in the Statistical Information section of Item 8 of this Report for additional information included herein by reference.

We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using a method prescribed by SFAS 114, “Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.” All
nonperforming loans are considered impaired under SFAS 114. Specific allowances for individual loans over a set dollar threshold are determined by our Special Asset Committee based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows
from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. We establish specific allowance on all other impaired loans based on the loss given default credit risk rating.

Allocations to non-impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans (pool reserve allocations) are assigned to pools of loans as defined by our
business structure and are based on internal probability of default and loss given default credit risk ratings.

Key
elements of the pool reserve methodology include:

•

Probability of default (“PD”), which is based on historical default analyses and is derived from the borrower’s internal PD credit risk rating and expected loan term;

•

Exposure at default (“EAD”), which is derived from historical default data; and

•

Loss given default (“LGD”), which is based on historical loss data, collateral value and other structural factors that may affect our ultimate ability to collect on the
loan and is derived from the loan’s internal LGD credit risk rating.



Our pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PDs, LGDs and EADs. In general, a
given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for non-impaired commercial loans. Our commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are most sensitive to changes in the
key risk parameters and pool reserve loss rates. To illustrate, if we increase the pool reserve loss rates by 5% for all categories of non-impaired commercial loans, then the aggregate of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allowance for
unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit would increase by $29 million. Additionally, other factors such as the rate of migration in the severity of problem loans or changes in the maturity distribution of the loans will contribute to the
final pool reserve allocations.

We make consumer (including residential mortgage) loan allocations at a total portfolio level by consumer product line
based on historical loss experience. We compute a four-quarter average loss rate from net charge-offs for the prior four quarters as a percentage of the average loans outstanding in those quarters. We apply this loss rate to loans outstanding at the
end of the current period to determine the consumer loan allocation.

We establish reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not considered in the
specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies, such as, but not limited to, industry concentrations and conditions, credit quality trends, recent loss experience in particular sectors of the portfolio, experience, ability and depth of lending
management, changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and the timing of available information. The amount of reserves for these qualitative factors is assigned to loan categories and to business segments based on the relative specific and
pool allocation amounts. Enhancements to the reserve methodology in the third quarter of 2005 resulted in more precise modeling of pool allocations and reduced the amount of reserve allocated for qualitative factors. This portion represented 9.9% of
the total allowance and .12% of total loans at December 31, 2005.

Charge-Offs And Recoveries

(a)

Includes a $53 million loan recovery.

(b)

During the first quarter of 2004, we changed our policy for recognizing charge-offs on smaller nonperforming commercial loans. This change resulted in the recognition of an
additional $24 million of gross charge-offs for the first quarter of 2004.

Apart from the impact of the items described in footnotes
(a) and (b) above, commercial net charge-offs declined $35 million in 2005 compared with the prior year primarily due to an improvement in the overall credit quality of the commercial loan portfolio. The increase in equipment lease
financing net charge-offs in 2005 compared with the prior year reflected an additional charge-off in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to a single leasing customer.

Aside from the impact of the $53 million loan recovery in 2005, increases in the provision for credit losses compared with 2004 and the allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of
credit as of December 31, 2005 reflected growth in loans and loan commitments and additional provisions related to a leasing customer. The provision includes amounts for probable losses on loans and credit exposure related to unfunded loan
commitments and letters of credit.

We do not expect to sustain asset quality at its current level. However, based on the assets we currently hold and
current business trends and activities, we believe that overall asset quality will remain strong at least for the near term. This outlook, combined with expected loan growth, may result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses in
future periods.

Credit Default Swaps

Credit default swaps provide, for a fee,
an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying financial instruments. We use the contracts to mitigate credit risk associated with commercial lending activities as well as proprietary derivative and
convertible bond trading. Credit default swaps are included in the Free-Standing Derivatives table in the Financial Derivatives section of this Risk Management discussion. We realized minimal net gains in connection with credit default swaps during
2005 and a net loss of $4.4 million in 2004.

Interest Rate Derivative Risk Participation Agreements

We enter into risk participation agreements to share credit exposure with other financial counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or take on credit
exposure to generate revenue. Risk participation agreements are included in the Free-Standing Derivatives table in the Financial Derivatives section of this Risk Management discussion.

Agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2003 are considered to be financial guarantees and, therefore, are not included in the Financial Derivatives section of this Risk Management discussion. Risk participation
agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2003 used by us to mitigate credit risk had a notional amount of $3 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $36 million at December 31, 2004. Risk participation agreements entered into in
which we assumed credit risk exposure had a total notional amount of $18 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $24 million at December 31, 2004.

Operational risk is defined as the risk of financial loss or other damage to us resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or from
external events. Operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways, including but not limited to the following:

•

Errors related to transaction processing and systems,

•

Breaches of the system of internal controls and compliance requirements, and

•

Business interruptions and execution of unauthorized transactions and fraud by employees or third parties.

Operational losses may arise from legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance with contracts, laws or regulations.

To monitor and control operational risk, we maintain a comprehensive framework including policies and a system of internal controls that is designed to manage risk and
to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of PNC. Management at each business unit is primarily responsible for its operational risk management program, given that operational risk management is integral to
direct business management and most easily effected at the business unit level. Corporate Operational Risk Management, reporting to the Chief Risk Officer, oversees day-to-day operation risk management activities.

Technology Risk

The technology risk management program is a
significant component of the operational risk framework. We have an integrated security and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure a secure, sound, and compliant infrastructure for information management. The technology risk
management process is aligned with the strategic direction of the businesses and is integrated into the technology management culture, structure and practices. The application of this framework across the enterprise helps to support comprehensive
and reliable internal controls.

Our business resiliency program manages the organization’s capabilities to provide services in the case of an event
that results in material disruption of business activities. Prioritization of investments in people, processes, technology and facilities are based on different types of events, business risk and criticality. Comprehensive testing validates our
resiliency capabilities on an ongoing basis, and an integrated governance model is designed to help assure transparent management reporting.

Insurance

As a component of our risk management practices, we purchase insurance programs designed to protect us against accidental
loss or losses which, in the aggregate, may significantly affect personnel, property, financial objectives, or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups.

PNC, through subsidiary companies, Alpine Indemnity Limited and PNC Insurance Corp., participates as a reinsurer for its general liability, automobile liability and
workers’ compensation programs and as a direct writer for its property and certified domestic terrorism programs. PNC’s risks associated with its participation as a reinsurer or direct writer for these programs are mitigated through policy
limits, annual aggregate limits, umbrella/excess liability coverage and reinsurance ceded beyond per occurrence deductible limits.

Liquidity risk is the risk of potential loss if we were
unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. We manage liquidity risk to help ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal “business as usual” and stressful
circumstances.

Asset and Liability Management (“ALM”) is accountable for managing the liquidity position within the limits and guidelines set
forth in our risk management policies. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight for the measurement, monitoring and reporting of PNC’s liquidity risk.

We typically maintain our liquidity position through:

•

A large and stable deposit base derived from our retail and wholesale banking activities,

•

A portfolio of liquid investment securities,

•

Diversified sources of short-term and long-term wholesale funding, and

•

Significant unused borrowing capacity at both the FHLB and the Federal Reserve discount window.

Liquid assets consist of short-term investments (federal funds sold, resale agreements and other short-term investments) and securities available for sale. At December 31, 2005, our liquid assets totaled $23.6
billion, with $10.8 billion pledged as collateral for borrowings, trust, and other commitments.

PNC Bank, N.A. is a member of the FHLB and as such has
access to advances from the FHLB secured generally by residential mortgages, other real estate related loans, and mortgage-backed securities. At December 31, 2005, our total unused borrowing capacity from the FHLB under current collateral
requirements was $23.3 billion.

We can also obtain funding through alternative forms of borrowing, including federal funds purchased, repurchase
agreements, and short-term and long-term debt issuances. In July 2004, PNC Bank, N.A. established a program to offer up to $20 billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt obligations with maturities of more than nine months. As of
December 31, 2005, PNC Bank, N.A. had issued $2.4 billion of debt under this program, including the following 2005 issuances:

•

$350 million of floating rate notes were issued in March 2005 and mature in April 2006 with interest payable monthly at the rate of 1-month LIBOR minus 3.5 basis points.

•

Senior bank notes totaling $500 million were issued in July 2005 and $75 million were issued in



August 2005. These issuances mature in January 2007 and February 2007, respectively. Interest will be reset monthly to 1-month LIBOR minus 3 basis points and
will be paid monthly on each issuance.

•

$500 million of subordinated bank notes were issued in September 2005 and mature in September 2017. These notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed annual rate of 4.875%.

None of the 2005 issuances outlined above are redeemable or subject to repayment at the option of the holder prior to maturity.

In December 2004, PNC Bank, N.A. established a program to offer up to $3.0 billion of its commercial paper. As of December 31, 2005, $10 million of commercial
paper was outstanding under this program.

Our parent company’s routine funding needs consist primarily of dividends to PNC shareholders, share
repurchases, debt service, the funding of non-bank affiliates, and acquisitions. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet these requirements over the succeeding 12-month period.
In managing parent company liquidity we consider funding sources, such as expected dividends to be received from PNC Bank, N.A. and potential debt issuance, and discretionary funding uses, the most significant of which is the external dividend to be
paid on PNC’s stock.

The principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, N.A., which may be impacted by the
following:

•

Capital needs,

•

Laws and regulations,

•

Corporate policies,

•

Contractual restrictions, and

•

Other factors.

Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on
the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. We provide additional information on these limitations in Note 4 Regulatory Matters in the
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and include such information here by reference. Dividends may also be impacted by the bank’s capital needs and by contractual restrictions. The amount available for
dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank, N.A. without prior regulatory approval was approximately $567 million at December 31, 2005.

In
addition to dividends from PNC Bank, N.A., other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and short-term investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2005, the parent company had
approximately $1.4 billion in funds available from its cash and short-term investments.

We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and
PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of securities in public or private markets. BlackRock, one of our majority-owned non-bank subsidiaries, also has access to public and private financing.

In March 2005, PNC issued two series of senior debt under PNC’s effective shelf registration statements. The first series consisted of $350 million of 4.2% Senior Notes due
2008 and the second series consisted of $350 million of 4.5% Senior Notes due 2010. The Senior Notes due 2008 were issued at a price of 99.953%, resulting in proceeds to PNC of approximately $350 million. The Senior Notes due 2010 were issued at a
price of 99.774%, resulting in proceeds to PNC of approximately $349 million.

•

PNC issued $400 million of senior notes in December 2005 that mature in December 2010. These notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 5.125%.

None of the 2005 issuances outlined above are redeemable or subject to repayment at the option of the holder prior to maturity.

At December 31, 2005, we had unused capacity under effective shelf registration statements of approximately $1.6 billion of debt or equity securities.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, no parent company senior debt matured. As of December 31, 2005, there were $1.1 billion of parent company contractual
obligations with maturities of less than one year.

Market risk is
the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the
following activities, among others:

•

Traditional banking activities of taking deposits and extending loans,

•

Private equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and

•

Trading in fixed income products, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange, as a result of customer activities, underwriting, and proprietary trading.

We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor, and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent
oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board.

Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect
the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities. Because of repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect
expected near-term earnings, but the economic values of these assets and liabilities as well.

ALM centrally manages interest rate risk subject to interest
rate risk limits and certain policies approved by the Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) and the Risk Committee of the Board.

Sensitivity
results and market interest rate benchmarks for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 follow:



Interest Sensitivity Analysis

In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we
routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. The following Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios table reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month
periods assuming either the PNC Economist’s most likely rate forecast or implied market forward rates which result in a flatter rate scenario. We are inherently sensitive to lower rates, combined with a flatter yield curve.

When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve,
the volume and characteristics of new business, and the behavior of existing positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented
in the following table. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at market rates.

All changes in
forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.

The graph below presents the yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternative scenarios one year forward.

Over the last several years, we have taken steps to position our balance sheet to benefit from rising long-term interest rates.
As a result of this program, we closed the year in an essentially rate-neutral position. Going forward, we believe that we have the deposit funding base and flexibility to change our investment profile to take advantage, where appropriate, of
changing interest rates and to adjust to changing market conditions.

Our trading activities include the underwriting of fixed income and equity securities, as well as
customer-driven and proprietary trading in fixed income securities, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange contracts.

For each trading group (e.g.,
fixed income, derivatives, foreign exchange), we have implemented a set of risk limits that govern that particular group. Our overall corporate trading risk policy governs the nature and allocation of these limits.

We use a variety of statistical and non-statistical measurements to assess the level of market risk arising from trading activities. We use value-at-risk
(“VaR”) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in trading activities. VaR offers a common measure to compare trading risk across portfolios with exposures to different types of market factors. As required under the Market
Risk Amendment to the Basel Accord, we calculate risk-weighted capital for trading activities, which is driven by average VaR usage. For internal risk management purposes, we also estimate the amount of economic capital required by trading
activities at a 99.9% level of confidence over a three-month horizon. This measure is driven by both average VaR usage and potential future usage based on portfolio VaR limits.

The Risk Committee of the Board establishes an enterprise-wide VaR limit on trading activities. VaR limits for individual business units are established by ALCO.



The following table shows VaR usage for 2005 by product type:

VaR Usage by Product Type

To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise-wide, we use a
process known as backtesting. The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of trading-related gains or losses against the VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. We would expect a maximum of two to three
instances a year in which actual losses exceeded the prior day VaR measure. During the full year of 2005, there were no such instances at the enterprise-wide level.

The following graph shows a comparison of enterprise-wide trading-related gains and losses against prior day VaR for the period.

Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking
deposits, and underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations, and later-stage growth financings in a variety of industries. We have
investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments. In addition, we have investments in non-affiliated funds that invest in early stage and technology companies. New commitments to all non-affiliated
private equity funds will continue to be minimal. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors.

The primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is economic capital. Economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk.
It is the worst-case value depreciation over one year within a 99.9% confidence level. Given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. Market Risk Management provides independent
oversight of the valuation process.

Various PNC business units manage our private equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible
for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.

Private Equity

The private equity portfolio is comprised of investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment.



Private equity investments are reported at fair value. Changes in the values of private equity investments are reflected
in our results of operations. Due to the nature of the direct investments, we must make assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among other factors, to determine the
estimated fair value of the investments. Market conditions and actual performance of the investments could differ from these assumptions. Accordingly, lower valuations may occur that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. Also, the
valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments. See Private Equity Asset Valuation in the Critical Accounting Policies And Judgments section of Item 7 of this Report for additional information.

At December 31, 2005, private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $449 million compared with $470 million at December 31,
2004. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 38% of the amount is invested directly in a variety of companies and approximately 62% is invested in various limited partnerships. Private equity unfunded commitments totaled $78 million at
December 31, 2005 compared with $119 million at December 31, 2004.

Additionally, in October 2005, we committed $200 million to PNC Mezzanine
Partners III, L.P., a $350 million mezzanine fund, that will invest principally in subordinated debt securities with an equity component. Funding of this investment is expected to occur over a five-year period. The limited partnership will be
consolidated for financial reporting purposes as PNC will have a 57% ownership interest.

Other Investments

We also make investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. As of December 31, 2005, major
investments of this type included low income housing tax credits and capitalized servicing rights for commercial mortgage loans. Other investments include BlackRock’s mutual funds, hedge funds, and CDOs for which the economic values could be
driven by either the fixed-income market or the equity markets, or both.

NFLATION

Our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not
affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. During periods of inflation, monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains. The concept of
purchasing power, however, is not an adequate indicator of the effect of inflation on banks because it does not take into account changes in interest rates, which are an important determinant of our earnings.

F

D

ERIVATIVES

We use a
variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk
related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate and total return swaps, interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments used by us for interest rate risk management.

Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. For interest rate swaps and total return swaps, options and futures contracts,
only periodic cash payments and, with respect to options, premiums, are exchanged. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.

Not all elements of interest rate, market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for
their intended purposes due to unanticipated market characteristics, among other reasons.

Accounting Hedges - Fair Value Hedging Strategies

We enter into interest rate and total return swaps, interest rate caps, floors and futures derivative contracts to hedge designated commercial
mortgage loans held for sale, commercial loans, bank notes, senior debt and subordinated debt for changes in fair value primarily due to changes in interest rates. Adjustments related to the ineffective portion of fair value hedging instruments are
recorded in interest income, interest expense or noninterest income depending on the hedged item.

Accounting Hedges - Cash Flow Hedging Strategy

We enter into interest rate swap contracts to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in
order to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest income. The fair value of these derivatives is reported in other assets or other liabilities and offset in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the effective portion
of the derivatives. When the hedged transaction culminates, any unrealized gains or losses related to these swap contracts are removed from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are included in interest income. Any ineffectiveness of the
strategy, as defined by our documented policies and procedures, is reported in interest income.

Free-Standing Derivatives

To accommodate customer needs, we also enter into financial derivative transactions primarily consisting of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, futures,
swaptions, and foreign exchange and equity contracts. We manage our market risk exposure from customer positions through transactions with third-party dealers. The credit risk associated with derivatives executed with customers is essentially the
same as that involved in extending loans and is subject to normal credit policies. We may obtain collateral based on our assessment of the customer. For derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in trading
noninterest income.



Also included in free-standing derivatives are transactions that we enter into for risk management and proprietary
purposes that are not designated as accounting hedges, primarily interest rate and basis swaps, interest rate caps and floors, credit default swaps, option contracts and certain interest rate-locked loan origination commitments as well as
commitments to buy or sell mortgage loans.

Basis swaps are agreements involving the exchange of payments, based on notional amounts, of two floating rate
financial instruments denominated in the same currency, one pegged to one reference rate and the other tied to a second reference rate (e.g., swapping payments tied to one-month LIBOR for payments tied to three-month LIBOR). We use these contracts
to mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced interest rate.

Interest rate-lock commitments for, as well as commitments to buy or
sell, mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered free-standing derivatives. Our interest rate exposure on certain commercial mortgage interest rate lock commitments is economically hedged with pay-fixed interest rate swaps and forward
sales agreements. These contracts mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced rate.

We purchase and sell credit default swaps to
mitigate the economic impact of credit losses on specifically identified existing lending relationships or to generate revenue from proprietary trading activities. These derivatives typically are based upon the change in value, due to changing
credit spreads, of publicly-issued bonds.

We enter into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other financial
counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue. We will make/receive payments under these guarantees if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under certain credit agreements.
Agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2003 are considered financial guarantees. Agreements entered into after June 30, 2003 are considered free-standing derivatives.

We occasionally purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative. At the inception of the financial instrument, we assess whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative
are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument (host contract), whether the financial instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative and the host contract is measured at fair value with changes in
fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would not meet the definition of a derivative. If the embedded derivative does not meet these three conditions, the embedded derivative
would qualify as a derivative instrument and be recorded apart from the host contract and carried at fair value with changes recorded in current earnings.

Free-standing derivatives also include positions we take based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and the market based upon stated risk management objectives.



The following tables provide the notional amount and fair value of financial derivatives used for risk
management and designated as accounting hedges as well as free-standing derivatives at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Weighted-average interest rates presented are based on contractual terms, if fixed, or the implied forward yield curve at each
respective date, if floating. The credit risk amounts of these derivatives as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 are presented in Note 16 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Summary Results

Consolidated net income for 2004 was $1.197 billion or $4.21 per diluted share compared with $1.001 billion or $3.55 per diluted share for 2003.

Results for 2004 reflected the impact of charges totaling $49 million after taxes, or $.17 per diluted share, related to the BlackRock LTIP as described
under “2002 BlackRock Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan” in Item 7 of this Report.

Results for 2003 included expenses totaling $87
million after taxes, or $.31 per diluted share, in connection with the agreement with the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), including related legal and consulting costs. Net income for 2003 also included the cumulative effect of
a change in accounting principle that negatively impacted earnings by $28 million, or $.10 per diluted share.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income was $1.969 billion for 2004 compared with $1.996 billion for 2003. Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $1.989 billion in 2004, a
decline of $17 million, or 1%, compared with 2003. The net interest margin was 3.22% for 2004, a decline of 42 basis points compared with 2003. The continued low interest rate environment, a decline in loan yields that significantly exceeded the
decrease in average rates paid on deposits, and sales and maturities of securities that were replaced at lower yields all contributed to a lower net interest margin compared with 2003. The impact of the United National acquisition in the first
quarter of 2004 partially offset these factors.

Provision For Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was $52 million for 2004 compared with $177 million for 2003. The significant decline in the provision for credit losses compared with 2003 was primarily due to the overall improvement
in the credit quality of the loan portfolio during 2004. This improved credit quality reflected a 46% decline in nonperforming loans since December 31, 2003 and a reduction in problems related to performing credits. The favorable impact of
these factors on the provision was partially offset by the impact of overall loan growth in 2004.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income was $3.563 billion for 2004 compared with $3.257 billion for 2003, an increase of $306 million, or 9%.

Higher noninterest income in 2004 reflected the following:

•

An increase of $188 million, or 12%, in asset management and fund servicing fees combined,

•

Equity management (private equity activities) net gains of $67 million in 2004 compared with net losses of $25 million in the prior year,

•

Pretax gains totaling $47 million from two sale transactions that occurred during the first half of 2004 as described in the analysis of other noninterest income below, and

•

The impact of the addition of United National’s business, which contributed approximately $21 million of noninterest income during 2004.

Lower net securities gains, lower trading revenue and lower gains from loan sales partially offset the impact of these positive factors in the comparison with 2003.

Additional Analysis

Combined asset management
and fund servicing fees totaled $1.811 billion for 2004, an increase of $188 million compared with 2003. This increase reflected growth in assets managed and serviced, partially due to improved equity market conditions that began in 2003 and
continued into 2004.

Consolidated assets under management were $383 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of $29 billion from December 31,
2003, primarily due to growth in assets managed by BlackRock. PFPC provided fund accounting/administration services for $721 billion of net fund assets at December 31, 2004 compared with $654 billion at December 31, 2003. PFPC also
provided custody services for $451 billion of fund assets at December 31, 2004, an increase of $50 billion from the prior year-end. Net new business, comparatively improved equity market conditions and asset inflows from existing clients all
contributed to the increases in the PFPC statistics.

Service charges on deposits totaled $252 million for 2004, an increase of $13 million or 5% compared
with 2003. Additional checking relationships, which increased 8% as of December 31, 2004, drove the improvement in this area.

Brokerage fees totaled
$219 million for 2004 and $184 million for 2003. The 19% increase compared with 2003 reflected higher non-trading, fee-based brokerage revenue.

Consumer
services fees grew 5% in 2004, to $264 million, compared with the prior year. Higher fees for 2004 were partially due to additional fees from debit card transactions that reflected higher volumes, including the impact of United National customers,
partially offset by the impact of the sale of certain out-of-footprint ATMs.

Visa settled litigation in 2003 with major retailers regarding pricing and
usage of customer debit cards. The settlement effectively lowered prices paid by merchants to Visa and its member banks beginning August 1, 2003. Although PNC was not a defendant in the litigation, the settlement lowered future revenue from
certain types of debit card transactions. The lost revenue impact to PNC in 2004 was approximately $10 million and for 2003 was approximately $6 million.

Corporate services revenue was $493 million for 2004, a decline of $13 million or 3% compared with 2003. Net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to our liquidation of institutional loans held for sale are reflected in this line
item and totaled $52 million for 2004 compared with $69 million for 2003. Higher fees related to an increase in commercial mortgage servicing activities and higher letters of credit fees



partially offset the decline in net gains on institutional loans held for sale compared with the prior year.

Equity management net gains on portfolio investments totaled $67 million for 2004 compared with net losses of $25 million for 2003.

Net securities gains were $55 million in 2004 compared with $116 million in 2003. Net securities gains for 2003 included $25 million related to the liquidation that year
of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions.

Noninterest revenue from trading activities totaled $113 million for 2004 and $127 million
for 2003. We provide additional information on our trading activities under Market Risk Management – Trading Risk in the Risk Management section of this Item 7.

Other noninterest income totaled $289 million for 2004, an increase of $53 million or 22% compared with 2003. Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from year to year depending on the nature and magnitude of
transactions completed. Other noninterest income for 2004 included the following:

•

A $34 million pretax gain related to the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts as described under DIG B36 Impact on 2003 Results and 2004 Sale of Modified Coinsurance Contracts
below, and

•

A $13 million pretax gain recognized during the second quarter of 2004 in connection with BlackRock’s sale of its interest in Trepp LLC.

In addition to these items, the increase in other noninterest income for 2004 compared with the prior year included the recognition of $25 million of private equity
dividends in 2004 and the comparative impact of $12 million related to the mid-2003 adoption of FIN 46.

Partially offsetting the impact of these items on
other noninterest income was a $7 million decline in leasing revenue resulting from the 2004 sale of our vehicle leasing.

As required by the FASB, effective October 1, 2003 we adopted the provisions of Derivatives Implementation Group Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. B36, “Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance
Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments” (“DIG B36”), for our annuity coinsurance agreements.
Our initial adoption of the provisions of DIG B36 to existing coinsurance agreements as of October 1, 2003 was reported in our Consolidated Income Statement as the cumulative effect of an accounting change and reduced both fourth quarter and
full year 2003 net income by $28 million, or $.10 per diluted share. Subsequent to initial adoption, other noninterest income increased by $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of DIG B36.

During the first quarter of 2004, we recognized a $34 million pretax gain on the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts. We continue to sell various annuity products
from which we earn commission income as further described under Product Revenue in Item 7 of this Report.

Noninterest Expense

Total noninterest expense was $3.735 billion for 2004, an increase of $259 million or 7% compared with $3.476 billion in 2003. The efficiency ratio was 68% for 2004 and
66% for 2003.

Noninterest expense for 2004 included the following:

•

Pretax charges totaling $110 million, including $96 million recorded in the third quarter, associated with the BlackRock LTIP;

•

Costs totaling approximately $78 million resulting from the United National acquisition, including approximately $11 million of conversion-related and other nonrecurring costs; and

•

A $22 million reduction in the benefit of accretion related to a discounted PFPC client contract liability that ended during the second quarter of 2004.

In addition to these items, the increase in noninterest expense for 2004 compared with 2003 included the impact of the following items, which had no effect on 2004
consolidated net income:

•

An increase of $30 million related to the mid-2003 adoption of FIN 46, and

•

An increase of $22 million in PFPC out-of-pocket and pass-through expenses which are offset in noninterest income.

Noninterest expense for 2003 included the impact of the following items:

•

Expenses totaling $120 million recognized in connection with a subsidiary’s second quarter 2003 agreement with the DOJ, including $5 million of related legal and consulting
costs;

•

Costs totaling $29 million paid in connection with our 2003 liquidation of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions. The impact of these costs was mostly offset
by related net securities gains included in noninterest income;

•

Distributions on capital securities totaling $28 million;

•

Facilities charges totaling $25 million related to leased space consistent with the requirements of SFAS 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities;” and

•

A $25 million benefit from the vehicle leasing settlement during the fourth quarter of 2003.

Apart from the items described above, noninterest expense for 2004 increased $174 million compared with 2003. Higher expenses in 2004 were primarily attributable to higher sales-based compensation, stock-based
incentive compensation and marketing costs. These charges more than offset the benefit of lower pension expense in the comparison and an $87 million incremental benefit in 2004 from efficiency initiatives.



Effective Tax Rate

Our effective tax rate for 2004 was 30.8% compared with 33.7% for 2003. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2004 was primarily attributable to the following:

•

A reduced state and local tax expense due to tax benefits of $18 million recorded in connection with New York state and city audits, principally associated with BlackRock, and

•

A $14 million reduction in income tax expense following our determination in the third quarter of 2004 that we no longer required an income tax reserve related to bank-owned life
insurance.

Loans

Loans increased $7.2 billion, or 20%, as of
December 31, 2004 compared with December 31, 2003. The increase in total loans reflected the following:

•

Home equity loans increased $2.9 billion, reflecting organic growth and the purchase of approximately $660 million of home equity loans in early 2004,

•

Demand for commercial loans grew during the year, reflected in the $2.4 billion increase in this loan category, and

•

Automobile and other consumer loans combined increased $.8 billion.

The
favorable impact of these factors on our loan balances was partially offset by the effect of the sale of the vehicle leasing portfolio in 2004. We added $1.9 billion of loans with the United National acquisition in 2004, as reflected in various loan
categories.

Securities

Total securities at
December 31, 2004 were $16.8 billion compared with $15.7 billion at December 31, 2003. Securities represented 21% of total assets at December 31, 2004 compared with 23% at December 31, 2003. The increase in total securities
compared with December 31, 2003 was primarily due to increases in U.S. Treasury and government agencies and mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by declines in commercial mortgage-backed and asset- backed securities.

At December 31, 2004, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of $102 million, which represented the difference between fair value
and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2003 was a net unrealized gain of $4 million. The impact on bond prices of increases in interest rates during 2004 was reflected in the net unrealized loss position at December 31,
2004. The expected weighted-average life of securities available for sale was 2 years and 8 months at December 31, 2004 compared with 2 years and 11 months at December 31, 2003.

Loans Held For Sale

Education loans held for sale totaled $1.1
billion at December 31, 2004, and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and represented the majority of our loans held for sale at each date. Loans held for sale remaining from our 2001 institutional lending repositioning totaled $5 million at
December 31, 2004 and $70 million at December 31, 2003.

Asset Quality

Nonperforming assets were $175 million at December 31, 2004, a decline of $153 million from December 31, 2003. The decline in nonperforming assets reflected the significant improvement in overall asset
quality during 2004. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans, loans held for sale and foreclosed assets was .39% at December 31, 2004 compared with .87% at December 31, 2003. The allowance for loan and lease losses was $607
million and represented 1.40% of total loans and 424% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2004. The comparable amounts were $632 million, 1.74% and 238%, respectively, at December 31, 2003.

Funding Sources

Total funding sources were $65.2 billion at
December 31, 2004 and $56.7 billion at December 31, 2003, an increase of $8.5 billion. This increase reflected the impact of the following 2004 developments:

•

Our United National acquisition,

•

An 8% increase in checking relationships,

•

An increase in time deposits in foreign offices that reflected our increased use of Eurodollar deposits as a short-term funding mechanism,

•

The issuance of $500 million of 18 month, floating rate bank notes in September 2004 and $500 million of 5.25% subordinated bank notes due 2017 in December 2004, and

•

An increase in other short-term borrowings to fund asset growth.

These increases were partially offset by debt maturities of $2.4 billion during 2004.

Shareholders’ Equity

The increase of $.8 billion, to $7.5 billion, in total shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2004 compared with the prior year-end was
primarily attributable to $360 million of common stock issued as part of the January 2004 United National acquisition and a higher retention of earnings through 2004 in anticipation of the SSRM acquisition by BlackRock and the pending acquisition of
Riggs. Partially offsetting this increase was a decline in the fair value of securities available for sale and cash flow hedge derivatives due to the impact of rising interest rates that began during the second quarter of 2004 and continued into the
latter half of the year. These fair value changes are captured in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholders’ equity.



Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2004 were 7.6% for leverage, 9.0% for tier 1 risk-based and 13.0% for
total risk-based capital. The regulatory capital ratios were 8.2% for leverage, 9.5% for tier 1 risk-based and 13.8% for total risk-based capital at December 31, 2003.

Glossary of Terms

Accounting/administration net fund assets

- Net domestic and foreign fund investment assets
for which we provide accounting and administration services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Adjusted average total
assets

- Primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on available-for-sale debt securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets.

Annualized

- Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity.

Assets under management

- Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Basis point

- One hundredth of a percentage point.

Charge-off

- Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from a bank’s balance sheet because the loan is considered uncollectible. A charge-off is also recorded when a loan is transferred to held for
sale and the loan’s market value is less than its carrying amount.

Common shareholders’ equity to total assets

- Common
shareholders’ equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders’ equity equals total shareholders’ equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock.

Credit derivatives

- Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event of one or more referenced credits. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection buyer and protection
seller at the inception of a transaction, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency and failure to meet payment obligations when due. The buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon
the occurrence, if any, of a credit event.

Custody assets

- All investment assets held on behalf of clients under safekeeping arrangements. We do
not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Investment assets held in custody at other institutions on our behalf are included in the appropriate asset categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as if physically held by us.

Derivatives

- Financial contracts whose value is derived from publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market
indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including forward contracts, futures, options and swaps.

Duration of equity

-
An estimate of the rate sensitivity of a firm’s economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity (

i.e.,

positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability
sensitivity (

i.e.,

vulnerable to rising rates). For example, if the duration is +1.5 years, the economic value of equity declines by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.

Earning assets

- Assets that generate income, which include: federal funds sold; resale agreements; other short-term investments, including trading securities;
loans held for sale; loans, net of unearned income; securities; and certain other assets.

Economic capital

- Represents the amount of resources
that a business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency. It is based on a measurement of economic risk, as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies. The economic capital measurement process
involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with an institution’s target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a “common currency” of risk that allows an
institution to compare different risks on a similar basis.

Economic value of equity (“EVE”)

- The present value of the expected cash
flows of our existing assets less the present value of the expected cash flows of our existing liabilities, plus the present value of the net cash flows of our existing off-balance sheet positions.

Effective duration

- A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of
on- and off- balance sheet positions.

Efficiency

- Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income
and noninterest income.

Foreign exchange contracts

- Contracts that provide for the future receipt and delivery of foreign currency at previously
agreed-upon terms.

Funds transfer pricing

- A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources
and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of business segments. These balances are assigned funding rates that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures, using the
least-cost funding sources available.



Futures and forward contracts

- Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a
specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument.

GAAP

- Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Interest rate floors and
caps

- Interest rate protection instruments that involve payment from the seller to the buyer of an interest differential, which represents the difference between a short-term rate (e.g., three-month LIBOR) and an agreed-upon rate (the strike
rate) applied to a notional principal amount.

Interest rate swap contracts

- Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability
management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on notional principal amounts.

Leverage ratio

- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by adjusted average total assets.

Net interest margin

- Annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets.

Nondiscretionary assets under administration

- Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a non-discretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Noninterest income to total revenue

- Noninterest income divided by the sum of net interest income and
noninterest income.

Nonperforming assets

- Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans, nonaccrual loans held
for sale, and foreclosed assets and other assets. Interest income does not accrue on assets classified as nonperforming.

Nonperforming loans

-
Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, lease financing, consumer, commercial real estate and residential mortgage customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include nonaccrual loans held for sale or
foreclosed and other assets. Interest income does not accrue on loans classified as nonperforming.

Notional amount

- - A number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivatives contract.

Operating leverage

- The period to period percentage
change in total revenue less the percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive percentage indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (i.e., positive operating leverage) while a negative percentage implies expense growth exceeded
revenue growth (i.e., negative operating leverage).

Options

- Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the
obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a period or at a specified date in the future.

Recovery

- Cash proceeds received on a loan that had previously been charged off. The amount received is credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses.

Return on average capital

- Annualized net income divided by average capital.

Return on average assets

- Annualized net income divided by average assets.

Return on average common equity

- Annualized net income divided by average common shareholders’ equity.

Risk-weighted assets

- Primarily computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights (as defined by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to
assets and off-balance sheet instruments.

Securitization

- The process of legally transforming financial assets
into securities.

Swaptions

– Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an
interest rate swap agreement during a period or at a specified date in the future.

Tangible common capital ratio

- Common shareholders’ equity
less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights) divided by assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights).

Taxable-equivalent interest

- The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a
taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets is increased to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable
investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement.

Tier 1 risk-based capital

- Tier 1 risk-based
capital equals: total shareholders’ equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain minority interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain other intangible assets, less equity investments in nonfinancial companies
and less net unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities and net unrealized
holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders’ equity for tier 1 risk-based capital purposes.

Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio

- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.



Total fund assets serviced

- Total domestic and offshore fund investment assets for which we provide related
processing services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Total return swap

- A non-traditional swap where one party
agrees to pay the other the “total return” of a defined underlying asset (e.g., loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are
passed through to the counterparty. The counterparty is therefore assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset.

Total risk-based
capital

- Tier 1 risk-based capital plus qualifying senior and subordinated debt, other minority interest not qualified as tier 1, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations.

Total risk-based capital ratio

- Total risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.

Transaction deposits

- The sum of money market and interest-bearing demand deposits and demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits.

Yield curve (shape of the yield curve, flat yield curve)

- A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the
same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a “normal” or “positive” yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A “flat” yield curve exists when yields are the same
for short-term and long-term bonds. A “steep” yield curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds.

NFORMATION

We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook or expectations for earnings, revenues, expenses and/or other matters regarding or affecting PNC that are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“outlook,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project” and other similar words and expressions.

Forward-looking statements
are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements. Actual
results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that we anticipated in our forward-looking statements, and future results could differ materially from our historical performance.

Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties. We provide greater detail regarding these factors elsewhere in this
Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.

•

Our business and operating results are affected by business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business. We are affected by
changes in our customers’ financial performance, as well as changes in customer preferences and behavior, including as a result of changing economic conditions.

•

The value of our assets and liabilities, as well as our overall financial performance, are affected by changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt and equity markets.
Actions by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates, can affect our activities and financial results.

•

Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as on our credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and
revenues.



•

Our ability to implement our One PNC initiative, as well as other business initiatives and strategies we may pursue, could affect our financial performance over the next several
years.

•

Our ability to grow successfully through acquisitions is impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the
integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing. These uncertainties are present in transactions such as the pending acquisition by BlackRock of Merrill Lynch’s investment management business and continue to be present with
respect to the integration of Riggs National Corporation.

•

Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses or our financial condition or results of operations or our competitive position or
reputation. Reputational impacts, in turn, could affect matters such as business generation and retention, our ability to attract and retain management, liquidity and funding. These developments could include (a) the resolution of legal
proceedings or regulatory and other governmental inquiries; (b) increased litigation risk from recent regulatory and other governmental developments; (c) the results of the regulatory examination process, our failure to satisfy the
requirements of agreements with governmental agencies, and regulators’ future use of supervisory and enforcement tools; (d) legislative and regulatory reforms, including changes to laws and regulations involving tax, pension and the
protection of confidential customer information; and (e) changes in accounting policies and principles.

•

Our business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through the
effective use of third-party insurance and capital management techniques.

•

Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can have an impact on our ability to respond to customer needs and to meet competitive demands. The adequacy of our
intellectual property protection, and the extent of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others, can also impact our business and operating results.

•

Our business and operating results can be affected by widespread natural disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities, either as a result of the impact on the
economy and financial and capital markets generally or on us or on our customers, suppliers or other counterparties specifically.

Also,
risks and uncertainties that could affect the results anticipated in forward-looking statements or from historical performance relating to our majority-owned subsidiary BlackRock, Inc. are discussed in more detail in BlackRock’s filings with
the SEC, accessible on the SEC’s website and on or through BlackRock’s website at www.blackrock.com.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of The PNC Financial Services Group,
Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated March 3, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

RESENTATION

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent
company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly owned, and certain partnership interests and variable interest entities. We prepared these statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“generally accepted accounting principles” or “GAAP”). We have eliminated all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform with the 2005 presentation. These
reclassifications did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Special Purpose Entities

Special purpose entities are broadly defined as legal entities structured for a particular purpose. We use special purpose entities in various
legal forms to conduct normal business activities. Special purpose entities that meet the criteria for a Qualifying Special Purpose Entity (“QSPE”) as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (“SFAS”) 140,
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” are not required to be consolidated. We review special purpose entities that are not QSPEs for consolidation in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46R”).

In general, a variable interest entity (“VIE”) is a special purpose entity formed as a corporation, partnership, limited liability corporation, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold
assets that either:

•

Does not have equity investors with voting rights that can directly or indirectly make decisions about the entity’s activities through those voting rights or similar rights, or

•

Has equity investors that do not provide enough cash or other financial resources for the entity to support its activities.

A VIE often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property.

We consolidate a VIE if we are considered to be its primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE’s
activities, is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns, or both. Upon consolidation of a VIE, we generally record all of the VIE’s assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value, with future changes
based upon consolidation accounting principles. See Note 3 Variable Interest Entities for more information about non-consolidated VIEs in which we hold a significant interest.

OMBINATIONS

We record the net assets of companies that we acquire at their

estimated fair value of the net assets acquired.

ECOGNITION

We earn net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including:

•

Lending,

•

Securities portfolio,

•

Investment management and fund servicing,

•

Customer deposits,

•

Loan servicing,

•

Brokerage services, and

•

Securities and derivatives trading activities including foreign exchange.



We also earn revenue from selling loans and securities, and we recognize income or loss from certain private equity
activities. We also earn fees and commissions from:

•

Issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees,

•

Selling various insurance products,

•

Providing treasury management services,

•

Providing mergers and acquisitions advisory and related services, and

•

Participating in certain capital markets transactions.

We recognize
revenue from loan servicing, securities and derivatives and foreign exchange trading, and securities underwriting activities as they are earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur or as services are provided. Revenue earned on
interest-earning assets is recognized based on the effective yield of the financial instrument. Service charges on deposit accounts are recognized as charged. Brokerage fees and gains on the sale of securities and certain derivatives are recognized
on a trade-date basis.

We recognize asset management and fund servicing fees primarily as the services are performed. Asset management fees are primarily
based on a percentage of the fair value of the assets under management and performance fees are primarily based on a percentage of the returns on such assets. Certain performance fees are earned upon attaining specified investment return thresholds
and are recorded as earned. Fund servicing fees are primarily based on a percentage of the fair value of the fund assets and the number of shareholder accounts we service.

We recognize revenue from the sale of loans upon closing of the transaction. We record private equity income or loss based on changes in the valuation of the underlying investments or when we dispose of our interest.
Dividend income from private equity investments is generally recognized when received.

In certain circumstances, revenue is reported net of associated
expenses in accordance with applicable accounting guidance and industry practice.

NVESTMENTS

We have interests in various types of
investments. The accounting for these investments is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, items such as:

•

Marketability of the investment,

•

Ownership interest,

•

Our plans for the investment, and

•

The nature of the investment.

Private Equity Investments

We report private equity investments, which include direct investments in companies, interests in limited partnerships, and affiliated partnership
interests, at estimated fair values. These estimates are based upon available information and may not necessarily represent amounts that we will ultimately realize through distribution, sale or liquidation of the investments. The valuation
procedures applied to direct investments include techniques such as multiples of cash flow of the entity, independent appraisals of the entity or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. We value affiliated partnership
interests based on the underlying investments of the partnership using procedures consistent with those applied to direct investments. We generally value limited partnership investments based on the financial statements we receive from the general
partner. We include all private equity investments in the consolidated balance sheet in other assets. Changes in the fair value of these assets are recognized in noninterest income.

We consolidate private equity investments when we are the sole general partner in a limited partnership and have determined that we have control of the partnership.

Equity Securities and Partnership Interests

We account for equity investments other than private equity investments under one of the following methods:

•

Marketable equity securities are recorded on a trade-date basis and are accounted for at fair value based on the securities’ quoted market prices from a national securities
exchange. Dividend income on these securities is recognized in net interest income. Those purchased with the intention of recognizing short-term profits are placed in the trading account, carried at market value and classified as short-term
investments. Gains and losses on trading securities are included in noninterest income. Marketable equity securities not classified as trading are designated as securities available for sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and
losses, net of income taxes, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Any unrealized losses that we have determined to be other than temporary are recognized in the period that the determination is made.

•

Investments in nonmarketable equity securities are recorded using the cost or equity method of accounting. The cost method is used for those investments in which we
do not have significant influence over the investee. Under this method, there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value. If the decline is determined to be other than temporary, we write down the cost
basis of the investment to a new cost basis that represents realizable value. The amount of the write-down is accounted for as a loss included in noninterest income in the period the determination is made. Distributions received from income on cost
method investments are included in interest or noninterest income depending on the type of



investment. We use the equity method for those investments in which we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Under the equity
method, we record our equity ownership share of the net income or loss of the investee in noninterest income. We include nonmarketable equity securities in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.

For investments in limited partnerships that are not required to be consolidated, we use either the cost method or the equity method as described above for nonmarketable
equity securities. We use the equity method if our limited partner ownership interest in the partnership is greater than 3%. We use the cost method for the remaining limited partnership investments. We account for general partnership interests under
the equity method when we have determined that we do not have control over these entities and are not required to consolidate them. General and limited partnership investments are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.

Debt Securities

Debt securities are recorded
on a trade-date basis. We classify debt securities as securities and carry them at amortized cost if we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Debt securities that we purchase for short-term appreciation or other
trading purposes are carried at market value and classified as short-term investments. Gains and losses on these securities are included in noninterest income. Debt securities not classified as held to maturity or trading are designated as
securities available for sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of available for sale debt
securities are recognized as a securities loss included in noninterest income in the period in which the determination is made. We review for impairment all debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position on a quarterly basis.

We include all interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the interest method, in net interest income. We compute
gains and losses realized on the sale of debt securities available for sale on a specific security basis and include them in noninterest income.

We designate
loans and related loan commitments as held for sale when we have a positive intent to sell them. We transfer loans and commitments to the loans held for sale category at the lower of cost or fair market value. At the time of transfer, related
write-downs on the loans and commitments are recorded as charge-offs or as a separate liability. We establish a new cost basis upon transfer and recognize any subsequent lower of cost or market adjustment as a valuation allowance with charges
included in noninterest income. Gains or losses on the actual sale of these loans are also included in noninterest income.

We apply the lower of cost or
market analysis on pools of homogeneous loans and commitments on a net aggregate basis. For non-homogeneous loans and commitments, we do this analysis on an individual loan and commitment basis.

Interest income with respect to loans held for sale other than those in nonaccrual status is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding.

In certain circumstances, loans and commitments designated as held for sale may be later transferred back to the loan portfolio based on a change in strategy to retain
the credit exposure to those customers. We transfer these loans and commitments to the portfolio at the lower of cost or market value.

Loans are stated at the principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned

interest income as earned. Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs, and loan premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized to income, over periods not exceeding the contractual life of the loan, using methods that approximate the
interest method.

We also provide financing for various types of equipment, aircraft, energy and power systems, and rolling stock through a variety of
lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Leveraged leases, a form of financing lease, are carried net of nonrecourse debt.
We recognize income over the term of the lease using methods that approximate the interest method. Lease residual values are reviewed for other-than-temporary impairment on at least an annual basis. Gains or losses on the sale of leased assets are
included in other noninterest income while valuation adjustments on lease residuals are included in other noninterest expense.

We recognize the sale of loans
or other financial assets when the transferred assets are legally isolated from our creditors and the appropriate accounting criteria are met. We also sell mortgage and other loans through secondary market securitizations. In certain cases, we may
retain a portion or all of the securities issued, interest-only strips, one or more subordinated tranches, servicing rights and, in some cases, cash reserve accounts, all of which are considered retained interests in the transferred assets. Our loan
sales and securitizations are generally structured without recourse to us and with no restrictions on the retained interests. In the event we are obligated for recourse liabilities in a sale, our policy is to record such liabilities at fair value
upon closing of the transaction. Gains or losses recognized on the sale of the loans depend on the allocation of carrying value between the loans sold and the retained interests, based on their relative fair market values at the date of sale. We
generally estimate fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows



using assumptions as to discount rates, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit losses and servicing costs, if applicable. Gains or losses on these
transactions are reported in noninterest income.

Servicing rights retained are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair market value and are
amortized over their estimated lives in proportion to estimated net servicing income.

Each quarter, we evaluate our servicing assets for impairment by
categorizing the pools of assets underlying servicing rights by product type. A valuation allowance is recorded and reduces current income when the carrying amount of a specific asset category exceeds its fair value.

We classify other securities retained as debt securities available for sale or other assets, depending on the form of the retained interest. Retained interests that are
subject to prepayment risk are reviewed on a quarterly basis for impairment. If the fair value of the retained interest is below its carrying amount and the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, then the decline is reflected as a charge
to earnings. We recognize other adjustments to the fair market value of retained interests classified as securities through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.

Nonperforming assets include:

•

Nonaccrual loans,

•

Troubled debt restructurings,

•

Nonaccrual loans held for sale, and

•

Foreclosed assets.

Other than consumer loans, we generally classify
loans and loans held for sale as nonaccrual when we determine that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful or when a default of interest or principal has existed for 90 days or more and the loans are not well-secured or in the process of
collection. When the accrual of interest is discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and unpaid interest accrued in the prior year, if any, is charged against the allowance for loan and lease
losses. We charge-off loans other than consumer loans based on the facts and circumstances of the individual loan.

Consumer loans well-secured by
residential real estate, including home equity and home equity lines of credit, are classified as nonaccrual at 12 months past due. We charge-off these loans based on the facts and circumstances of the individual loan.

For consumer loans not well-secured or in the process of collection, we classify home equity loans as nonaccrual at 120 days past due and home equity lines of credit as
nonaccrual at 180 days past due and record them at the lower of cost or market value, less liquidation costs. These consumer loans are generally charged-off in the month they become 120 days past due for closed-end loans and 180 days past due for
revolving lines of credit.

A loan is categorized as a troubled debt restructuring in the period of restructuring if a significant concession is granted
due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower.

Nonperforming loans are generally not returned to performing status until the obligation
is brought current and the borrower has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and collection of the contractual principal and interest is no longer doubtful. Nonaccrual commercial and commercial real
estate loans and troubled debt restructurings are designated as impaired loans. We recognize interest collected on these loans on the cash basis or cost recovery method.

Foreclosed assets are comprised of any asset seized or property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. These assets are recorded on the date acquired at the lower of
the related loan balance or market value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs. We estimate market values primarily based on appraisals when available or quoted market prices on liquid assets. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are valued
at the lower of the amount recorded at acquisition date or the current market value less estimated disposition costs. Valuation adjustments on these assets and gains or losses realized from disposition of such property are reflected in noninterest
expense.

We maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that we believe to be adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan
portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses, which is charged against operating results, and decreased by the amount of charge-offs, net of recoveries. Our determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on
periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change, including, among others:

•

Expected default probabilities,

•

Loss given default,

•

Exposure at default,

•

Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans,

•

Value of collateral,

•

Estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and

•

Amounts for changes in economic conditions and potential estimation or judgmental errors.

In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, we make specific allocations to impaired loans, to pools of watchlist and nonwatchlist loans and to consumer and residential mortgage loans. We
also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not covered in specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies related to qualitative and measurement factors. While allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans, the
total reserve is available for all credit losses.



Specific allocations are made to significant impaired loans and are determined in accordance with SFAS 114,
“Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,” with impairment measured generally based on the present value of the loan’s expected cash flows, the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the loan’s
collateral. We establish a specific allowance on all other impaired loans based on the loan’s loss given default credit risk rating.

Allocations to
loan pools are developed by business segment based on probability of default and loss given default risk ratings by using historical loss trends and our judgment concerning those trends and other relevant factors. These factors may include, among
others:

•

Actual versus estimated losses,

•

Regional and national economic conditions, and

•

Business segment and portfolio concentrations.

Loss factors are based on
industry and/or internal experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that, based on our judgment, impact the collectibility of the portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Consumer and residential mortgage loan allocations are made at a
total portfolio level based on historical loss experience adjusted for portfolio activity.

While our pool reserve methodologies strive to reflect all risk
factors, there continues to be a certain element of uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential estimation errors and imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent lag of information. We provide additional reserves that
are designed to provide coverage for expected losses attributable to such risks. In addition, these incremental reserves also include factors which may not be directly measured in the determination of specific or pooled reserves. These factors
include:

•

Industry concentration and conditions,

•

Credit quality trends,

•

Recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio,

•

Experience, ability and depth of lending management,

•

Changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and

•

Bank regulatory considerations.

We provide
servicing under various commercial loan servicing contracts. These contracts are either purchased in the market place or retained as part of a commercial mortgage loan securitization or loan sale. If a contract is purchased, it is recorded at cost.
If a contract is retained, the servicing right is recorded based on its relative fair value to all of the assets securitized or sold. Fair value is based on the present value of the expected future cash flows, including assumptions as to:

•

Interest rates for escrow and deposit balance earnings,

•

Discount rates,

•

Estimated prepayment speeds, and

•

Estimated servicing costs.

We record the asset as an other intangible
asset and amortize it over its estimated life in proportion to estimated net servicing income. On a quarterly basis, we test the asset for impairment. If the estimated fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is
recognized. Servicing fees are recognized as they are earned and are reported net of amortization expense in noninterest income.

CTIVITIES

We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process to manage interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We use substantially all such instruments to
manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate and total return swaps, interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest rate risk management.

Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. We manage these risks as part of our asset and liability management process and
through credit policies and procedures. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk by entering into transactions with only high-quality institutions, establishing credit limits, and generally requiring bilateral netting and collateral agreements.

We recognize all derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities in other assets or other liabilities. The accounting for changes in
the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. For derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in trading noninterest income.

For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we must designate the hedging instrument, based on the exposure
being hedged, as either a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. We have no derivatives that hedge the net investment in a foreign operation.

We formally document the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy before undertaking a hedge.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivatives and related hedged items must be designated as a hedge. For hedging relationships in which effectiveness is measured, we formally assess, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, if
the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued.

For derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability attributable to a particular
risk), changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative are recognized in earnings and offset by recognizing changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. To the extent the hedge is ineffective, the changes
in fair value will not offset and the difference is reflected in the same financial statement category as the hedged item.

For derivatives designated as
cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows), the effective portions of the gain or loss on derivatives are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently
reclassified in interest income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The change in fair value of any ineffective portion of the hedging derivative is recognized immediately as a charge to earnings.

We discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that the derivative is no longer an effective hedge; the derivative expires or is sold, terminated
or exercised; or the derivative is de-designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge or it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period. If we determine that the derivative no
longer qualifies as a fair value or cash flow hedge and therefore hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will continue to be recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in current earnings. For a
discontinued fair value hedge, the previously hedged item is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because
it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative will continue to be recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in current earnings, and the gains and losses in accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) will be recognized immediately into earnings. When we discontinue hedge accounting because the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or no longer designated, the amount reported in other comprehensive income up to
the date of sale, termination or de-designation continues to be reported in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction affects earnings.



We did not terminate any cash flow hedges in 2005, 2004 or 2003 due to a determination that a forecasted transaction was
no longer likely to occur.

We occasionally purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative. At the inception of the
transaction we assess if economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument (host contract), whether the financial instrument that embodies both the
embedded derivative and the host contract is measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would not meet the definition of a derivative. If
the embedded derivative does not meet these three conditions, the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument and be recorded apart from the host contract and carried at fair value with changes recorded in current earnings.

We enter into commitments to make loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is set prior to funding (interest rate lock commitments). We also enter into
commitments to purchase mortgage loans (purchase commitments). Both interest rate lock commitments and purchase commitments on mortgage loans that will be held for resale are accounted for as free-standing derivatives. Interest rate lock commitments
and purchase commitments that are considered to be derivatives are recorded at fair value in other assets or other liabilities. Fair value of interest rate lock commitments and purchase commitments is determined as the change in value that occurs
after the inception of the commitment considering the projected security price, fees collected from the borrower and costs to originate, adjusted for anticipated fallout risk. We recognize the gain or loss from the change in fair value of these
derivatives in trading noninterest income.

RONOUNCEMENTS

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140,” that
permits fair value remeasurement of certain hybrid financial instruments, clarifies the scope of SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” regarding interest-only and principal-only strips, and provides
further guidance on certain issues regarding beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, concentrations of credit risk and qualifying special purpose entities. SFAS 155 is effective for all instruments acquired or issued as of the first
fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006 and may be applied to certain other financial instruments held prior to the adoption date. Earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year providing the entity has
not yet issued financial statements. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. (“FSP”) FAS 115-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.” This FSP clarified and reaffirmed existing guidance as to when
an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. Certain disclosures about unrealized losses on available for sale debt and equity securities that have not been
recognized as other-than-temporary impairments are required under FSP 115-1. The FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. As the FSP reaffirms existing guidance, we do not expect this FSP to have a significant impact
on our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2005, the total unrealized losses in the securities available for sale portfolio was $373 million compared with total unrealized losses of $125 million at December 31, 2004.

In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) of the FASB issued EITF Issue 04-5, “Determining Whether a General Partner, or the
General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights.” EITF 04-5 provides that the general partner(s) is presumed to control the limited partnership, unless the limited
partners possess either substantive participating rights or the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partner(s) without cause (“kick-out rights”). Kick-out rights are substantive if they
can be exercised by a simple majority of the limited partners voting interests. The guidance applies to limited partnerships formed or modified after June 29, 2005, and to existing limited partnerships no later than January 1, 2006. The
adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections – a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.” SFAS 154 generally requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of all voluntary
changes in accounting principle and changes required when a new pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. This standard applies to PNC beginning January 1, 2006.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”). SFAS 123R replaces SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25.
SFAS 123R requires compensation cost related to share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value. In April 2005, the SEC issued a rule which delayed the required effective date to the beginning
of an entity’s fiscal year which begins after June 15, 2005. Accordingly, we will adopt SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective method of transition. This method requires the provisions of SFAS 123R be
applied to new awards and awards modified, repurchased or cancelled after the effective date. In November, 2005 the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 123R-3, “Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
Awards.” This FSP provides a transition election for calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R which may be made up to one year from the initial adoption
of SFAS 123R. Based on our review of the provisions of SFAS 123R and because we previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on January 1, 2003, we do not expect the adoption of the revised standard to have a significant
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”) created a one-time opportunity for US
companies to repatriate undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries at a substantially reduced federal tax rate. The reduced rate is achieved via an 85% dividends received deduction. To qualify for this deduction, repatriation of foreign
earnings was to be completed by December 31, 2005. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004”, which
requires that the total effect on income tax expense be disclosed in the enterprise’s financial statements for the period when the evaluation is completed. The impact of the foreign earnings repatriation provision of the AJCA on our
consolidated financial statements is discussed in Note 20 Income Taxes.

Also in December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions

.” SFAS 153 amends the APB 29 exception to fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges to apply only to those exchanges which lack commercial
substance, as defined in the standard. SFAS 153 was effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges that we entered into on or after July 1, 2005. The application of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements in 2005.



In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.” FSP 106-2 provides guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy and other provisions of The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. We adopted FSP 106-2 in the
third quarter of 2004. See Note 17 Employee Benefit Plans for additional information.

In December 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants issued Statement of Position 03-3, “Accounting for Loans and Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer” (“SOP 03-3”). SOP 03-3 addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected
to be collected from an initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences relate, at least in part, to a deterioration of credit quality. SOP 03-3 prohibits companies from carrying over valuation allowances
in the initial accounting for such loans and limits the yield that may be accreted to the excess of undiscounted expected cash flows over the initial investment in the loan. Decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment and increases
are recognized prospectively through an adjustment of the loan yield. SOP 03-3 was effective for loans and debt securities acquired by PNC on or after January 1, 2005. Application of this guidance did not have a significant effect on our
financial condition or results of operations in 2005.

2005 ACQUISITIONS

SSRM HOLDINGS, INC.

Effective January 31, 2005, our majority-owned subsidiary, BlackRock, closed the acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. (“SSRM”), the
holding company of State Street Research & Management Company and SSR Realty Advisors Inc., from MetLife, Inc. (“MetLife”) for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $265 million in cash and approximately 550,000 shares of
BlackRock restricted class A common stock valued at $37 million. SSRM, through its subsidiaries, actively manages stock, bond, balanced and real estate portfolios for both institutional and individual investors. Substantially all of SSRM’s
operations were integrated into BlackRock as of the closing date. BlackRock acquired assets under management totaling $50 billion in connection with this transaction.

The stock purchase agreement for the SSRM transaction provides for an additional payment to MetLife of up to $75 million based on BlackRock achieving specified retention levels of assets under management and run-rate
revenue for the year ended January 31, 2006. Based on assets under management levels and run-rate revenue as of January 31, 2006, the additional liability on this contingency is $50 million. In addition, the stock purchase agreement provides
for two other contingent payments. MetLife will receive 32.5% of any performance fees earned, as of March 31, 2006, on a certain large institutional real estate client. As of December 31, 2005, no performance fees had been earned on this
institutional real estate client as the measurement date had not concluded. In addition, on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSRM transaction, MetLife could receive an additional payment up to a maximum of $10 million based on
BlackRock’s retained assets under management associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans.

As of December 31,
2005, BlackRock was unable to estimate the potential obligations under these contingent payments because it was unable to predict at that time what specific retention levels of run-rate revenue would be for certain acquired accounts on the first
anniversary of closing the SSRM transaction, what performance fees would be earned on the institutional real estate client and what BlackRock’s retained assets under management would be on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the SSRM
transaction.

Contingent payments settled subsequent to the SSRM closing on January 31, 2005 but prior to December 31, 2005 reduced the
contingent liability established at the closing to $39.5 million at December 31, 2005. The $50 million contingency payment due January 31, 2006 eliminated this contingent liability balance. The $10.5 million excess of the January 31,
2006 contingency payment over the contingent liability balance at December 31, 2005 and additional contingency payments, if any, will be reflected as additional purchase price and recorded as goodwill.

On January 18, 2005, our ownership in BlackRock was transferred from PNC Bank, N.A. to PNC Bancorp, Inc., our intermediate bank holding company. The transfer was
effected primarily to give BlackRock more operating flexibility, particularly in connection with its acquisition of SSRM. As a result of the transfer, certain deferred tax liabilities recorded by PNC were reversed in the first quarter of 2005 in
accordance with SFAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” The reversal of deferred tax liabilities increased our earnings by $45 million, or approximately $.16 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2005.

In January 2005, BlackRock issued a bridge promissory note for $150 million, using the proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price for the SSRM acquisition. In
February 2005, BlackRock issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures. BlackRock used a portion of the net proceeds from this issuance to retire the bridge promissory note. These convertible debentures are included with
bank notes and senior debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005.

We are involved with various entities in the normal course of business that may be deemed to be VIEs. We consolidated certain VIEs as of December 31, 2005 and 2004
for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary.

Information about the VIEs in which we hold significant variable interests but have not
consolidated and those VIEs that we have consolidated in our financial statements follows:

Non-Consolidated VIEs
– Significant Variable Interests

(a)

Held by BlackRock.

(b)

Includes both PNC’s risk of loss and BlackRock’s risk of loss, limited to PNC’s ownership interest in BlackRock.

(c)

Includes off-balance sheet liquidity commitments to Market Street of $4.6 billion and other credit enhancements of $444 million.

Consolidated VIEs – PNC Is Primary Beneficiary

•

BlackRock is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that may be deemed to be VIEs and may hold interests therein, including investment advisory agreements
and equity securities, which may be considered variable interests. BlackRock engages in these transactions principally to address client needs through the launch of collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) and private investment funds.
BlackRock has not been deemed the primary beneficiary of these entities. Additional information about BlackRock is available in its SEC filings, which can be found at www.sec.gov and on BlackRock’s website, www.blackrock.com.

Market Street Funding LLC (“Market Street”), formerly Market Street Funding Corporation, is a multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduit that is owned by an
independent third party. Market Street’s activities are limited to the purchasing of assets or making of loans secured by interests primarily in pools of receivables from US corporations that desire access to the commercial paper market. Market
Street funds the purchases or loans by issuing commercial paper which has been rated A1/P1 by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively, and is supported by pool-specific credit enhancement, liquidity facilities and
program-level credit enhancement.

PNC Bank, N.A. provides certain administrative services, a portion of the program-level
credit enhancement and the majority of liquidity facilities to Market Street in exchange for fees negotiated based on market rates. Credit enhancement is provided in part by PNC Bank, N.A. in the form of a cash collateral account that is funded by a
loan facility that expires March 25, 2010. See Note 7 Loans, Commitments To Extend Credit and Concentrations of Credit Risk and Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees for additional information. PNC views its credit exposure to Market Street
transactions as limited. All of Market Street’s assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004 collateralize the commercial paper obligations. For the most part, PNC is not required to fund under the liquidity facilities if Market Street’s
assets are in default. Our obligations are secondary to the risk of first loss provided by sellers or another third party. Neither creditors nor equity investors in Market Street have any recourse to our general credit. PNC received program
administrator fees and commitment fees related to PNC’s portion of the liquidity facilities of $9.5 million and $3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (“FIN 46”), we consolidated Market
Street effective July 1, 2003 as we were deemed the primary beneficiary of Market Street. In October 2005, Market Street was restructured as a limited liability company and entered into a subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (“Note”)
with an unrelated third party. The principal amount of the Note was increased to $4.6 million by December 31, 2005 and has an original maturity of eight years. The Note bears interest at 18% with any penalty interest/fees charged by Market
Street on specific transactions accruing to the benefit of the Note holder. Proceeds from the issuance of the Note were placed in a first loss reserve account that may be used to reimburse any losses incurred by Market Street, PNC Bank, N.A. or
other providers under the liquidity facilities and the credit enhancement arrangements. As a result of the Note issuance, we reevaluated whether PNC continued to be the primary beneficiary of Market Street under the provisions of FIN 46R. Based on
this analysis, we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary and deconsolidated Market Street from our Consolidated Balance Sheet effective October 17, 2005.

•

We make certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) pursuant
to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings and to assist us in achieving goals
associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types
of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity, with equity typically comprising 30% to 60% of the total project capital.

We consolidated those LIHTC investments in which we own a majority of the limited partnership interests. We also consolidated entities in which we, as a national syndicator of affordable housing equity, serve as the
general partner (together with the aforementioned LIHTC investments), and no other entity owns a majority of the limited partnership interests. In these syndication transactions, we create funds in which our subsidiary is the general partner and
sells limited partnership interests to third parties, and in some cases may also purchase a limited partnership interest in the fund. The fund’s limited partners can generally remove the general partner without cause at any time. The purpose of
this business is to generate income from the syndication of these funds and to generate servicing fees by managing the funds. General partner activities include selecting, evaluating, structuring, negotiating, and closing the fund investments in
operating limited partnerships, as well as oversight of the ongoing operations of the fund portfolio. The assets are primarily included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Neither creditors nor equity investors in the LIHTC
investments have any recourse to our general credit. The consolidated aggregate assets and debt of these LIHTC investments are provided in the Consolidated VIEs – PNC Is Primary Beneficiary table and reflected in the Corporate &
Institutional Banking business segment.

We have a significant variable interest in certain other limited partnerships that sponsor
affordable housing projects. We do not own a majority of the limited partnership interests in these entities and are not the primary beneficiary. We use the equity method to account for our investment in these entities. Information regarding these
partnership interests is reflected in the Non-Consolidated VIEs – Significant Variable Interests table.



We also have subsidiaries that invest in and act as the investment manager for a private equity fund that is organized as
a limited partnership as part of our equity management activities. The fund invests in private equity investments to generate capital appreciation and profits. As permitted by FIN 46R, we have deferred applying the provisions of the interpretation
for this entity pending further action by the FASB. Information on this entity follows:

ATTERS

We are subject to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies and undergo periodic examinations by such regulatory authorities.

The access to and cost of funding new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and
nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution’s capital strength. The minimum regulatory capital ratios are 4% for tier 1 risk-based, 8% for total risk-based and 3% for leverage. However, regulators may
require higher capital levels when particular circumstances warrant. To qualify as “well capitalized,” regulators require banks to maintain capital ratios of at least 6% for tier 1 risk-based, 10% for total risk-based and 5% for leverage.
At December 31, 2005, each of our bank subsidiaries met the “well capitalized” capital ratio requirements. We believe our bank subsidiaries will continue to meet these requirements in 2006.

The following table sets forth regulatory capital ratios for PNC and its only significant bank subsidiary, PNC Bank, N.A.

Regulatory Capital

The principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, N.A., which may be
impacted by the following:

•

Capital needs,

•

Laws and regulations,

•

Corporate policies,

•

Contractual restrictions, and

•

Other factors.

Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on
the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank, N.A. without prior regulatory approval was approximately $567 million at
December 31, 2005.

In 2004, PNC Bank, N.A. received regulatory approval to reduce its capital through the in-kind transfer of its ownership interest
in BlackRock to PNC Bank, N.A.’s direct parent, PNC Bancorp, Inc. This transfer was completed in January 2005 and resulted in a reduction in regulatory capital for PNC Bank, N.A. of approximately $500 million. PNC Bank, N.A.’s capital was
replenished in January 2005 by its $500 million issuance of preferred stock, on an intercompany basis, to the top tier parent company of PNC.

Under
federal law, bank subsidiaries generally may not extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries on terms and under circumstances that are not substantially the same as comparable extensions of credit to nonaffiliates. No extension
of credit may be made to the parent company or a non-bank subsidiary which is in excess of 10% of the capital stock and surplus of such bank subsidiary or in excess of 20% of the capital and surplus of such bank subsidiary as to aggregate extensions
of credit to the parent company and its non-bank subsidiaries. Such extensions of credit, with limited exceptions, must be fully collateralized by certain specified assets. In certain circumstances, federal regulatory authorities may impose more
restrictive limitations.

Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank
(“FRB”). During 2005, subsidiary banks maintained reserves which averaged $196 million.

ROCEEDINGS

Some of our subsidiaries are defendants (or have potential contractual contribution obligations to other defendants) in
several pending lawsuits brought during late 2002 and 2003 arising out of the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications Corporation and its subsidiaries. There also are threatened additional proceedings arising out of the same matters. One of the
lawsuits was brought, on Adelphia’s behalf by the unsecured creditors’ committee and equity committee in Adelphia’s consolidated bankruptcy proceeding and was removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York by order dated February 9, 2006. The other lawsuits, one of which is a putative consolidated class action, were brought by holders of debt and equity securities of Adelphia and have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in that district
court. These lawsuits arise out of lending and securities underwriting activities engaged in by these PNC subsidiaries together with other financial services companies. In the aggregate, more than 400 other financial services companies and numerous
other companies and individuals have been named as defendants in one or more of the lawsuits. Collectively, with respect to some or all of the defendants, the lawsuits allege federal law claims, including violations of federal securities and other
federal laws, violations of common law duties, aiding and abetting such violations, voidable preference payments, and fraudulent transfers, among other matters. The lawsuits seek unquantified monetary damages, interest, attorneys’ fees and
other expenses, and a return of the alleged voidable preference and fraudulent transfer payments, among other remedies. We believe that we have defenses to the claims against us in these lawsuits, as well as potential claims against third parties,
and intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously. These lawsuits involve complex issues of law and fact, presenting complicated relationships among the many financial and other participants in the events giving rise to these lawsuits, and have not
progressed to the point where we can predict the outcome of these lawsuits. It is not possible to determine what the likely aggregate recoveries on the part of the plaintiffs in these matters might be or the portion of any such recoveries for which
we would ultimately be responsible, but the final consequences to PNC could be material.



On April 29, 2005, an amended complaint was filed in the putative class action against PNC; PNC Bank, N.A.; our
Pension Plan and its Pension Committee in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (originally filed in December 2004). The complaint claims violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (“ERISA”), arising out of the January 1, 1999 conversion of our Pension Plan from a traditional defined benefit formula into a “cash balance” formula, the design and continued operation of the Plan, and other related
matters. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all current and former employee-participants in and beneficiaries of the Plan as of December 31, 1998 and thereafter. Plaintiffs also seek to represent a subclass of all current and former
employee- participants in and beneficiaries of the Plan as of December 31, 1998 and thereafter who were or would have become eligible for an early retirement subsidy under the former Plan at some time prior to the date of the amended complaint.
The plaintiffs are seeking unquantified damages and equitable relief available under ERISA, including interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees. On November 21 2005, the court granted our motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Plaintiffs have
appealed this ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. We believe that we have substantial defenses to the claims against us in this lawsuit and intend to defend it vigorously.

In its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, Riggs disclosed a number of pending lawsuits. All material lawsuits have been finally resolved or settlement
agreements have been reached, in some cases subject to final documentation or court approval. None of the pending settlement amounts where the settlement has not been completed is material to PNC. The pending settlement amount for each of these
lawsuits has been reserved upon the recording of our acquisition of Riggs.

As a result of the acquisition of Riggs, PNC is now responsible for Riggs’
obligations to provide indemnification to its directors, officers, and, in some cases, employees and agents against certain liabilities incurred as a result of their service on behalf of or at the request of Riggs. PNC is also now responsible for
Riggs’ obligations to advance on behalf of covered individuals costs incurred in connection with certain claims or proceedings, subject to written undertakings to repay all amounts so advanced if it is ultimately determined that the individual
is not entitled to indemnification. Since the acquisition, we have advanced such costs on behalf of covered individuals from Riggs and expect to continue to do so in the future at least with respect to lawsuits and other legal matters identified in
Riggs’ first quarter 2005 Form 10-Q.

There are several pending judicial or administrative proceedings or other matters arising out of the three 2001
PAGIC transactions. These pending proceedings or other matters are described below. Among the requirements of a June 2003 Deferred Prosecution Agreement that one of our subsidiaries entered into relating to the PAGIC transactions was the
establishment of a Restitution Fund through our $90 million contribution. The Restitution Fund will be available to satisfy claims, including for the settlement of the pending securities litigation referred to below. Louis W. Fryman, chairman of Fox
Rothschild LLP in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is administering the Restitution Fund.

In December 2004 and January and March 2005, we entered into
settlement agreements relating to certain of the lawsuits and other claims arising out of the PAGIC transactions. These settlements are described below, following a description of each of these pending proceedings and other matters.

The several putative class action complaints filed during 2002 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania arising out of the PAGIC
transactions were consolidated in a consolidated class action complaint brought on behalf of purchasers of our common stock between July 19, 2001 and July 18, 2002 (the “Class Period”). The consolidated class action complaint
names PNC, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer, our Controller, and our independent auditors for 2001 as defendants and seeks unquantified damages, interest, attorneys’ fees and other expenses. The
consolidated class action complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws related to disclosures regarding the PAGIC transactions and related matters.



In August 2002, the United States Department of Labor began a formal investigation of the Administrative Committee of our
Incentive Savings Plan (“Plan”) in connection with the Administrative Committee’s conduct relating to our common stock held by the Plan. Both the Administrative Committee and PNC have cooperated fully with the investigation. In June
2003, the Administrative Committee retained Independent Fiduciary Services, Inc. (“IFS”) to serve as an independent fiduciary charged with the exclusive authority and responsibility to act on behalf of the Plan in connection with the
pending securities litigation referred to above and to evaluate any legal rights the Plan might have against any parties relating to the PAGIC transactions. This authority includes representing the Plan’s interests in connection with the
Restitution Fund set up under the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The Department of Labor has communicated with IFS in connection with the engagement.

We
received a letter in June 2003 on behalf of an alleged shareholder demanding that we take appropriate legal action against our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer, and our Controller, as well as any other
individuals or entities allegedly responsible for causing damage to PNC as a result of the PAGIC transactions. The Board referred this matter to a special committee of the Board for evaluation. The special committee completed its evaluation and
reported its findings to the Board of Directors and to counsel for the alleged shareholder. The special committee recommended against bringing any claims against our current or former executive officers but made certain recommendations with respect
to resolution of potential claims we had with respect to certain other third parties.

In July 2003, the lead underwriter on our Executive Blended Risk
insurance coverage filed a lawsuit for a declaratory judgment against PNC and PNC ICLC in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The complaint seeks a determination that the defendants breached the terms and
conditions of the policy and, as a result, the policy does not provide coverage for any loss relating to or arising out of the Department of Justice investigation or the PAGIC transactions. Alternatively, the complaint seeks a determination that the
policy does not provide coverage for the payments made pursuant to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The complaint also seeks attorneys’ fees and costs. In July 2004, the court granted our motion to stay the action until resolution of the
claims against PNC in the pending consolidated class action described above.

On December 17, 2004, we entered into a tentative settlement of the
consolidated class action. On March 25, 2005, the parties filed a stipulation of settlement of this lawsuit with the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. This settlement also covered claims by the plaintiffs
against AIG Financial Products and others related to the PAGIC transactions.

On December 17, 2004, we also settled all claims between us, on the one
hand, and AIG Financial Products and its affiliate, American International Surplus Lines Insurance Company (“AISLIC”), on the other hand, related to the PAGIC transactions. AIG Financial Products was our counterparty in the PAGIC
transactions, and AISLIC is one of the insurers under our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage. Subsequently, we settled claims against two of the other insurers under our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage, as described below. Each of
the amounts in these settlements represents a portion of the insurer’s share of our overall claim against our insurers with respect to any amounts disbursed out of the Restitution Fund. We are preserving our claim against our insurers with
which we have not settled.

The tentative settlement of the consolidated class action remains subject to court approval. The court held a hearing on
August 4, 2005 to determine whether to approve the proposed settlement agreement of the consolidated class action.



The following are the key elements of these settlements that remain conditional at present, pending court approval of the
tentative settlement of the consolidated class action:

•

Payments into Settlement Fund

. The insurers under our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage have funded $30 million to be used for the benefit of the class. AIG Financial
Products has funded an additional $4 million to be used for the same purpose. The plaintiffs have been in contact with Mr. Fryman, the administrator of the Restitution Fund, and intend to coordinate the administration and distribution of these
settlement funds with the distribution of the Restitution Fund. Neither PNC nor any of our current or former officers, directors or employees will be required to contribute any funds to this settlement.

•

Assignment of Claims

. We have assigned to the plaintiffs claims we may have against the non-settling defendant in the consolidated class action and all other unaffiliated
third parties (other than AIG Financial Products and its predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and their respective directors, officers and employees (collectively, “AIG”)) relating to the subject matter of this
lawsuit.

•

Insurance Claims

. In March 2005, we settled our claim against one of our insurers under our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage related to our contribution of $90
million to the Restitution Fund. Under this settlement, the insurer has paid us $11.25 million, but we are obligated to return this amount if the settlement of the consolidated class action referred to above does not receive court approval, does not
become effective or becomes unenforceable. The amount of this settlement will not be recognized in our income statement until the potential obligation to return the funds has been eliminated. This settlement was in addition to settlements with
AISLIC in December 2004 and with another of our insurers under the Executive Blended Risk policy in January 2005.

•

Other Claims

. In connection with the settlement of the consolidated class action, the claims of IFS on behalf of our Incentive Savings Plan and its participants are being
resolved and the class covered by the settlement is being expanded to include participants in the Plan. The Department of Labor is not, however, a party to this settlement and thus the settlement does not necessarily resolve its investigation.

In addition, the derivative claims asserted by one of our putative shareholders and any other derivative demands that may be
filed in connection with the PAGIC transactions are being resolved as a result of the settlement of the consolidated class action.

•

Releases

. We are releasing the insurers providing our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage from any further liability to PNC arising out of the events that gave rise to
the consolidated class action, except for the claims against these insurers (other than those with whom we have settled) relating to the $90 million payment to the Restitution Fund. In addition, PNC and AIG are releasing each other with respect to
all claims between us arising out of the PAGIC transactions.

We will be responsible for the costs of administering the settlement and the
Restitution Fund and may incur additional costs in the future in connection with the advancement of expenses and/or indemnification obligations related to the subject matter of this lawsuit. We do not expect such costs to be material.

In connection with industry-wide investigations of practices in the mutual fund industry including market timing, late day trading, employee trading in mutual funds and
other matters, several of our subsidiaries have received requests for information and other inquiries from state and federal governmental and regulatory authorities. These subsidiaries are fully cooperating in all of these matters.

In addition to the proceedings or other matters described above, PNC and persons to whom we may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, are
subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other
legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in the proceedings or
other matters specifically described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period.

ECURITIES

(a)

Securities held to maturity at December 31, 2005 totaled less than $.5 million.



Securities represented 23% of total assets at December 31, 2005 compared with 21% at December 31, 2004 and 23%
at December 31, 2003.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our most significant concentration of credit risk related to investments issued by the US
Government and its agencies. This exposure amounted to $3.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2004.

At
December 31, 2005, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of $370 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003 were net unrealized losses of $102 million and net unrealized gains of $4 million, respectively. The impact on bond prices of increases in interest rates during 2005 was reflected in the net unrealized loss position at
December 31, 2005.

The fair value of securities available for sale decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. Net unrealized gains and
losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in shareholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax.

The expected weighted-average life of securities available for sale was 4 years and 1 month at December 31, 2005, 2 years and 8 months at December 31, 2004, and 2 years and 11 months at December 31, 2003.

The following table presents unrealized loss and fair value of securities at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 for which an other-than-temporary
impairment has not been recognized. These securities are segregated between investments that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and greater than twelve months.

We do not believe any individual unrealized loss as of December 31, 2005 represents an other-than-temporary
impairment. The $72 million unrealized losses reported for US Treasuries and government agencies were primarily related to agency debenture securities. The $251 million unrealized losses reported for mortgage-backed securities relate primarily to
securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and private institutions. The $37 million unrealized losses reported for commercial mortgage-backed securities relate primarily to fixed rate
securities. The $10 million unrealized losses associated with asset-backed securities relate primarily to securities collateralized by home equity, automobile and credit card loans. The majority of the unrealized losses associated with both mortgage
and asset-backed securities are attributable to changes in interest rates and not from the deterioration of the credit quality of the issuer.

The carrying value of securities pledged to secure public and trust deposits and repurchase agreements and for
other purposes was $10.8 billion at December 31, 2005 and $8.1 billion at December 31, 2004. The fair value of securities accepted as collateral that we are permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge was $273 million at
December 31, 2005 and is a component of federal funds sold and resale agreements on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. All of this amount was sold or repledged to others.

The following table presents, by remaining contractual maturity, the amortized cost, fair value and weighted-average yield of debt securities at December 31, 2005.

Contractual Maturity Of Debt Securities

Based on current interest rates and expected prepayment speeds, the total weighted-average expected maturity of
mortgage-backed securities was 3 years and 9 months, of commercial mortgage-backed securities was 5 years and of asset-backed securities was 3 years at December 31, 2005. Weighted-average yields are based on historical cost with effective
yields weighted for the contractual maturity of each security.

Loans outstanding were as follows:

Total loans, net of unearned income, at December 31, 2004 included $2.3 billion related to Market Street. See
Note 3 Variable Interest Entities regarding the deconsolidation of Market Street effective October 17, 2005.

We realized net gains from sales of
commercial mortgages of $61 million in 2005, $50 million in 2004, and $52 million in 2003. Net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to the liquidation of our institutional loans held for sale totaled $7 million in 2005, $52 million in
2004, and $69 million in 2003. The liquidation of our institutional loans held for sale is complete. Gains on sales of education loans totaled $19 million in 2005, $30 million in 2004, and $20 million in 2003.

Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate exposure is
material in relation to our total credit exposure. Loans outstanding and related unfunded commitments are concentrated in our primary geographic markets. At December 31, 2005, no specific industry concentration exceeded 4.2% of total commercial
loans outstanding and unfunded commitments.

In the normal course of business, we originate or purchase loan products whose contractual features, when
concentrated, may increase our exposure as a holder and servicer of those loan products. Possible product terms and features that may create a concentration of credit risk would include loan products whose terms permit negative amortization, a high
loan-to-value ratio, features that may expose the borrower to future increases in repayments above increases in market interest rates, below-market interest rates and interest-only loans, among others.

We originate interest-only loans to commercial borrowers. These products are standard in the financial services industry and the features of these products are
considered during the underwriting process to mitigate the increased risk of this product feature that may result in borrowers not being able to make interest and principal payments when due. We do not believe that these product features create a
concentration of credit risk.

We also originate home equity loans and lines of credit that result in a credit concentration of high loan-to-value ratio
loan products at the time of origination. In addition, these loans are concentrated in our primary geographic markets as discussed above. At December 31, 2005, $5.6 billion of the $15.2 billion of home equity and other consumer loans (included
in “Consumer” in the table above) had a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80%. These loans are collateralized primarily by 1-4 family residential properties. As part of our asset and liability management activities, we also periodically
purchase residential mortgage loans that are collateralized by 1-4 family residential properties. At December 31, 2005, $3.8 billion of the $7.3 billion of residential mortgage loans were interest-only loans.

Net Unfunded Credit Commitments

Commitments to extend credit represent arrangements to lend funds subject to specified contractual conditions. At
both December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, commercial commitments are reported net of $6.7 billion of participations, assignments and syndications, primarily to financial services companies. Commitments generally have fixed expiration
dates, may require payment of a fee, and contain termination clauses in the event the customer’s credit quality deteriorates. Based on our historical experience, most commitments expire unfunded, and therefore cash requirements are
substantially less than the total commitment.

As a result of deconsolidating Market Street in October 2005, amounts related to Market Street were
considered third party unfunded commitments at December 31, 2005. These unfunded credit commitments totaled $4.6 billion at December 31, 2005 and are included in the preceding table primarily within the “Commercial” and
“Consumer” categories.



Net outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $4.2 billion at December 31, 2005 and $3.7 billion at
December 31, 2004. Standby letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of customers if certain specified future events occur. Such instruments are typically issued to support industrial revenue bonds, commercial paper, and
bid-or-performance related contracts. Maturities for standby letters of credit ranged from 2006 to 2015. See Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees for additional information.

At December 31, 2005, the largest industry concentration was for multifamily, which accounted for approximately 8.4% of the total letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances. Consumer home equity lines of
credit accounted for 77.5% of consumer unfunded credit commitments.

At December 31, 2005, we pledged $1.4 billion of loans to the FRB and $25.7
billion of loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) as collateral for the contingent ability to borrow, if necessary.

Certain directors and
executive officers of PNC and its subsidiaries, as well as certain affiliated companies of these directors and officers, were customers of and had loans with subsidiary banks in the ordinary course of business. All such loans were on substantially
the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other customers and did not involve more than a normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features. The
aggregate principal amounts of these loans were $21 million at December 31, 2005 and $19 million at December 31, 2004. During 2005, new loans of $63 million were funded and repayments totaled $61 million.

A summary of the changes in goodwill by business during 2005 follows:

Goodwill

We added $420 million of goodwill and $74 million of customer-related intangible assets in connection with our May
2005 acquisition of Riggs. Goodwill arising from the Riggs transaction is reflected in the Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking business segments in the table above. Substantially all of the other intangible assets recorded
in connection with the Riggs acquisition are included in the Retail Banking segment.

BlackRock recorded $293 million of customer-related and $13 million
of other intangible assets as described below in connection with its January 2005 SSRM acquisition.

Our Harris Williams acquisition resulted in the
addition of $144 million of goodwill and $32 million of other intangible assets in 2005, all of which are reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking business segment.

Note 2 Acquisitions contains further information on the Riggs, SSRM and Harris Williams transactions.

The increase in PFPC’s goodwill during 2005 was primarily due to an additional $24 million of goodwill and a corresponding liability recognized in connection with
the achievement of the contingent consideration threshold related to its 2003 ADVISORport acquisition. The additional consideration is expected to be paid in 2006.

Our ownership of BlackRock continues to change primarily when BlackRock repurchases its shares in the open market and issues shares for an acquisition or pursuant to its employee compensation plans. We recognize goodwill because BlackRock
repurchases its shares at an amount greater than book value and this results in an increase in our percentage ownership interest. The net impact of BlackRock’s stock activity during 2005, including the issuance of shares in the SSRM
acquisition, did not have a significant impact on goodwill.

The gross carrying amount, accumulated amortization and net carrying amount of other
intangible assets by major category consisted of the following:

Other Intangible Assets

(a)

Amounts for 2005 were reduced by retirements totaling $32 million, comprised of $25 million for Corporate & Institutional Banking and $7 million for Retail Banking.

Most of our other intangible assets have finite lives and are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis or, in the case of mortgage and
other loan servicing rights and certain core deposit intangibles, on an accelerated basis. In connection with the SSRM acquisition, BlackRock recorded $293 million of management contracts during 2005, of which approximately $229 million are
considered to have indefinite lives.

For customer-related intangibles, the estimated remaining useful lives range from approximately one year to 20 years,
with a weighted-average remaining useful life of approximately 7 years. Our mortgage and other loan servicing rights are amortized primarily over a period of seven to ten years in proportion to the estimated net servicing income from the related
loans.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill and net other intangible assets during 2005 follows:

Changes in Goodwill and Other Intangibles

(a)

Amounts for goodwill and customer-related intangibles reflect a transfer of $9 million and $4 million, respectively, from “Riggs acquisition” to “Merchant
Services” in connection with our acquisition of an increased ownership interest in Merchant Services during the fourth quarter of 2005.

(b)

See note (a) under the “Other Intangible Assets” table above.



Amortization expense on intangible assets for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $74 million, $52 million and $47 million,
respectively. Amortization expense on existing intangible assets for 2006 through 2010 is estimated to be as follows:

•

2006: $97 million,

•

2007: $89 million,

•

2008: $86 million,

•

2009: $80 million, and

•

2010: $61 million.

We conduct an annual goodwill impairment test on our
reporting units. We conducted this review during the fourth quarter of 2005, using data from September 30, 2005. Aside from any adverse triggering events that may occur earlier in the year, we will perform an annual test during the fourth
quarter of each year. The fair value of our reporting units is determined by using discounted cash flow and market comparability methodologies.

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we sold commercial mortgage loans totaling $284 million, $460 million and $401 million, respectively, in securitization transactions through
programs with the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”). The transactions and resulting receipt and subsequent sale of securities qualify as sales under the appropriate accounting criteria and resulted in pretax gains of $7
million in 2005 and $8 million in both 2004 and 2003. Additionally, we sold commercial mortgage loans of $3.1 billion in 2005, $1.6 billion in 2004 and $1.1 billion in 2003 for cash in other loan sales transactions. These transactions resulted in
pretax gains of $54 million in 2005, $42 million in 2004 and $44 million in 2003.

For the transactions above, we continue to perform servicing and
recognized servicing assets of $23 million in 2005, $14 million in 2004 and $13 million in 2003. In addition, we purchased servicing rights for commercial mortgage loans from third parties of approximately $112 million in 2005, $47 million in 2004
and $23 million in 2003.

In addition to the cash proceeds from the sales transactions above, net cash flows in 2005, 2004 and 2003 related to those
transactions were not significant.

Changes in the commercial mortgage servicing assets were as follows:

Commercial Mortgage Servicing Assets

(a)

2005 included $25 million of fully amortized retirements.

Assuming a
prepayment speed of 12%-15% for the respective strata discounted at 9%-10%, the estimated fair value of commercial mortgage servicing rights was $403 million at December 31, 2005. A 10% and 20% adverse change in all assumptions used to
determine fair value at December 31, 2005, results in a $30 million and $59 million decrease in fair value, respectively. No valuation allowance was necessary at December 31, 2005 or December 31, 2004.

We also own interest-only strips related to education loans totaling $58 million and $60 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.
These strips were retained from the sales of education loans to a third party trust prior to 2003. Loans that are held by the trust supporting the value of the strips were $123 million and $178 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004, respectively. The principal of these loans is effectively guaranteed by the federal government.

These capital securities represent non-voting preferred beneficial interests in the assets of PNC
Institutional Capital Trusts A and B, PNC Capital Trusts C and D, UNB Capital Trust I and Capital Statutory Trust II, and the Riggs Capital Trust and Capital Trust II (the “Trusts”). Trust A is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of PNC
Bank, N.A., PNC’s principal bank subsidiary. All other Trusts are wholly owned finance subsidiaries of PNC. The UNB Trusts were acquired effective January 1, 2004 as part of the United National acquisition. The Riggs Trusts were acquired
in May 2005 as part of the Riggs acquisition. In the event of certain changes or amendments to regulatory requirements or federal tax rules, the capital securities are redeemable in whole. With the exception of Riggs Capital Trust, the financial
statements of the Trusts are not included in PNC’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

•

Trust A, formed in December 1996, issued $350 million of 7.95% capital securities due December 15, 2026, that are redeemable after December 15, 2006 at a premium that

Trust D, formed in December 2003, issued $300 million of 6.125% capital securities due December 15, 2033 that are redeemable on or after December 18, 2008 at par.

•

UNB Capital Trust I, formed in March 1997 with $16 million outstanding of 10.01% capital securities due March 15, 2027, that are redeemable on or after March 15, 2007 at a
premium that declines from 105.00% to par on or after March 15, 2017.

UNB Capital Statutory Trust II, formed in December 2001, issued $30 million of capital securities due December 18, 2031, bearing interest at a floating rate per annum equal to
3-month LIBOR plus 360 basis points. The rate in effect at December 31, 2005 was 8.10%. Trust II is redeemable on or after December 18, 2006 at par.

•

Riggs Capital Trust was formed in December 1996 when $150 million of 8 5/8% capital securities were issued. These securities are due December 31, 2026, and are
redeemable after December 31, 2006 at a premium that declines from 104.313% to par on or after December 31, 2016. Riggs had acquired more than 50% of the capital securities and, therefore, under FIN 46R PNC is deemed to be the primary
beneficiary of the Trust. Accordingly, the financial statements of this Trust are included in PNC’s consolidated financial statements. The net



outstanding capital securities of $73 million are included as junior subordinated debt, and the related dividends are included in interest expense.

•

Riggs Capital Trust II was formed in March 1997 when $200 million of 8 7/8% capital securities were issued. These securities are due March 15, 2027, and are redeemable after
March 15, 2007 at a premium that declines from 104.438% to par on or after March 15, 2017. Riggs had acquired less than 50% of the capital securities and, therefore, under FIN 46R PNC is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
Accordingly, the financial statements of this Trust are not consolidated into PNC’s financial results. Junior subordinated debt of $206 million owed by PNC to this Trust is included in PNC’s balance sheet, with the related service cost
included in interest expense. The $50 million of acquired capital securities are included as securities available for sale, with the related dividends included in interest income.

At December 31, 2005, PNC’s junior subordinated debt of $1.538 billion included the $73 million of net outstanding capital securities of Riggs Capital Trust as
described above. The balance represents debentures issued by PNC or our subsidiary, PNC Bank, N.A., and purchased and held as assets by the Trusts.

The
obligations of the respective parent of each Trust, when taken collectively, are the equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee of the obligations of such Trust under the terms of the Capital Securities. Such guarantee is subordinate in right
of payment in the same manner as other junior subordinated debt. There are certain restrictions on PNC’s overall ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries. For additional disclosure on these funding restrictions, including an explanation of
dividend and intercompany loan limitations, see Note 4 Regulatory Matters.

stock or equivalent preferred stock at half of market value.

We have a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan. Holders of preferred stock and PNC
common stock may participate in the plan, which provides that additional shares of common stock may be purchased at market value with reinvested dividends and voluntary cash payments. Common shares issued pursuant to this plan were: 688,665 shares
in 2005, 744,266 shares in 2004, and 799,820 shares in 2003.

At December 31, 2005, we had reserved approximately 38.6 million common shares to
be issued in connection with certain stock plans and the conversion of certain debt and equity securities.

In February 2004, our Board of Directors
authorized the purchase of up to 20 million shares of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions through February 2005. The 2004 repurchase authorization was a replacement and continuation of the prior repurchase

ERIVATIVES

We use a variety of derivative financial instruments to help manage interest rate, market and credit risk and reduce the effects that changes in
interest rates may have on net income, fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility. These instruments include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, futures contracts, and total return swaps.

Fair Value Hedging Strategies

We enter into interest
rate and total return swaps, interest rate caps, floors and futures derivative contracts to hedge designated commercial mortgage loans held for sale, commercial loans, bank notes, senior debt and subordinated debt for changes in fair value primarily
due to changes in interest rates. Adjustments related to the ineffective portion of fair value hedging instruments are recorded in interest income, interest expense or noninterest income depending on the hedged item.



Cash Flow Hedging Strategy

We enter into interest rate swap contracts to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest income. We are hedging
our exposure to the variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for a maximum of 10 years for hedges converting floating-rate commercial loans to fixed. The fair value of these derivatives is reported in other assets or other
liabilities and offset in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the effective portion of the derivatives. When the hedged transaction culminates, any unrealized gains or losses related to these swap contracts are reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings and are included in interest income. Ineffectiveness of the strategy, as defined by risk
management policies and procedures, if any, is reported in interest income.

During the next twelve months, we expect to reclassify to earnings $8.6
million of pretax net losses, or $5.6 million after-tax, on cash flow hedge derivatives currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates
and the addition of other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2005. These net losses are anticipated to result from net cash flows on receive fixed interest rate swaps that would impact interest income recognized on the related floating rate
commercial loans.

As of December 31, 2005 we have determined that there were no hedging positions where it was probable that certain forecasted
transactions may not occur within the originally designated time period.

For those hedge relationships that do not qualify for assuming no
ineffectiveness, any ineffectiveness present in the hedge relationship is recognized in current earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in value of these derivatives resulted in a $3 million net loss in 2005 compared with a net loss of $5
million in 2004.

Free-Standing Derivatives

To
accommodate customer needs, we also enter into financial derivative transactions primarily consisting of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, futures, swaptions, and foreign exchange and equity contracts. We manage our market risk
exposure from customer positions through transactions with third-party dealers. The credit risk associated with derivatives executed with customers is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans and is subject to normal credit policies.
We may obtain collateral based on our assessment of the customer. For derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in trading noninterest income.

Basis swaps are agreements involving the exchange of payments, based on notional amounts, of two floating rate financial instruments denominated in the same currency, one pegged to one reference rate and the other
tied to a second reference rate (e.g., swapping payments tied to one-month LIBOR for payments tied to three-month LIBOR). We use these contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced interest rate.

We purchase and sell credit default swaps to mitigate the economic impact of credit losses on specifically identified existing lending relationships or to generate
revenue from proprietary trading activities. These derivatives typically are based on the change in value, due to changing credit spreads, of publicly-issued bonds.

Interest rate lock commitments for, as well as commitments to buy or sell, mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered free-standing derivatives. Our interest rate exposure on certain commercial mortgage
interest rate lock commitments is economically hedged with pay-fixed interest rate swaps and forward sales agreements. These contracts mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced rate.

Free-standing derivatives also include positions we take based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and the market
based on stated risk management objectives.

Derivative Counterparty Credit Risk

By purchasing and writing derivative contracts we are exposed to credit risk if the counterparties fail to perform. Our credit risk is equal to the fair value gain in the derivative contract. We minimize credit risk
through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures and collateral requirements. We generally enter into transactions with counterparties that carry high quality credit ratings.

We enter into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue. Risk
participation agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2003 were considered financial guarantees and therefore not included in derivatives. Agreements entered into subsequent to June 30, 2003 are included in the derivative table that
follows. We determine that we meet our objective of reducing credit risk associated with certain counterparties to derivative contracts when the participation agreements share in their proportional credit losses of those counterparties.

We generally have established agreements with our major derivative dealer counterparties that provide for exchanges of marketable securities or cash to collateralize
either party’s positions. At December 31, 2005 we held cash and US government and mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $100 million and pledged mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $163 million under these agreements.



The total notional or contractual amounts, estimated net fair value and credit risk for
derivatives were as follows:

We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Retirement benefits are derived from a cash balance formula based on compensation levels, age and length of service.
Pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants.

We also maintain
nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees. All retirement benefits provided under these plans are unfunded and we make any payments to plan participants. We also provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for
qualifying retired employees (“postretirement benefits”) through various plans.

During the second quarter of 2005, we acquired a frozen defined
benefit pension plan as a result of the Riggs acquisition. Plan assets and projected benefit obligations of the Riggs plan were approximately $107 million and $116 million, respectively, at acquisition date. The $9 million funding deficit was
recognized as part of the Riggs acquisition purchase price allocation. For determining contribution amounts to the plan, deficits are calculated using ERISA-mandated rules, and on this basis we contributed approximately $16 million to the Riggs plan
during the third quarter of 2005. We integrated the Riggs plan into the PNC plan on December 30, 2005.

We use a measurement date of December 31
for plan assets and benefit obligations. A reconciliation of the changes in the projected benefit obligation for qualified and nonqualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans as well as the change in plan assets for the qualified pension
plan is as follows:

The fair value of the qualified pension plan assets exceeds both the accumulated benefit obligation and the
projected benefit obligation. The nonqualified pension plan, which contains several individual plans that are accounted for together, is unfunded. Contributions from us and, in the case of postretirement benefit plans, participant contributions
cover all benefits paid under the nonqualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plans. The benefit obligations, asset values, funded status and balance sheet impacts are shown in the above table.

Assets related to our qualified pension plan (the “Plan”) are held in trust (the “Trust”). The trustee is PNC Bank, N.A. The Trust is
exempt from tax pursuant to section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). The Plan is qualified under section 401(a) of the Code. Plan assets consist primarily of listed domestic and international equity securities and US
government, agency, and corporate debt securities and, in 2005, real estate investments. Plan assets do not include common or preferred stock or any debt of PNC.

The Pension Plan Administrative Committee (the “Committee”) adopted the current Pension Plan Investment Policy Statement, including the updated target allocations and allowable ranges shown below, on November 29, 2005.

The long-term investment strategy for pension plan assets is to:

•

Meet present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries,

•

Cover reasonable expenses incurred to provide such benefits, including expense incurred in the administration of the Trust and the Plan,

•

Provide sufficient liquidity to meet benefit and expense payment requirements on a timely basis, and

•

Provide a total return that, over the long term, maximizes the ratio of trust assets to liabilities by maximizing investment return, at an appropriate level of risk.

The Plan’s specific investment objective is to meet or exceed the investment policy benchmark over the long term. The investment policy
benchmark compares actual performance to a weighted market index, and measures the contribution of active investment management and policy implementation. This investment objective is expected to be achieved over the long term (one or more market
cycles) and is measured over rolling five-year periods. Total return calculations are time-weighted and are net of investment-related fees and expenses.

The asset allocations for the Trust at the end of 2005 and 2004, and the target allocation for 2006, by asset category, are as follows:

The slight overweight in domestic equity at year-end 2005 and 2004 is attributable to the targeted allocation in
Private Equity, which continues to be committed but which is funded over time as suitable opportunities for private equity investment are identified and as calls for funding are made. The Investment Policy Statement provides that, from time to time,
domestic equity may serve as a proxy (substitute) for private equity. Additionally, target allocation changes, which were effective November 29, 2005, included reducing the High Yield Fixed Income allocation from 10% to 5% and creating a new
Real Estate allocation of 5%. It is anticipated that this transition will be completed during 2006 as suitable investment opportunities become available.

We believe that, over the long term, asset allocation is the single greatest determinant of risk. Asset allocation will deviate from the target percentages due to market movement, cash flows, and investment manager performance. Material
deviations from the asset allocation targets can alter the expected return and risk of the Trust. On the other hand, frequent rebalancing to the asset allocation targets may result in significant transaction costs, which can impair the Trust’s
ability to meet its investment objective. Accordingly, the Trust portfolio is periodically rebalanced to maintain asset allocation within the target ranges described above.

In addition to being diversified across asset classes, the Trust is diversified within each asset class. Secondary diversification provides a reasonable basis for the expectation that no single security or class of
securities will have a disproportionate impact on the total risk and return of the Trust.



The Committee selects investment managers for the Trust based on the contributions that their respective investment
styles and processes are expected to make to the investment performance of the overall portfolio. The managers’ Investment Objectives and Guidelines, which are a part of each manager’s Investment Management Agreement, document performance
expectations and each manager’s role in the portfolio. The Committee uses the Investment Objectives and Guidelines to establish, guide, control and measure the strategy and performance for each manager.

The purpose of investment manager guidelines is to:

•

Establish the investment objective and performance standards for each manager,

•

Provide the manager with the capability to evaluate the risks of all financial instruments or other assets in which the manager’s account is invested, and

•

Prevent the manager from exposing its account to excessive levels of risk, undesired or inappropriate risk, or disproportionate concentration of risk.

The guidelines also indicate which investments and strategies the manager is permitted to use to achieve its performance objectives, and which investments and strategies
it is prohibited from using.

Where public market investment strategies may include the use of derivatives and/or currency management, language is
incorporated in the managers’ guidelines to define allowable and prohibited transactions and/or strategies. Derivatives are typically employed by investment managers to modify risk/return characteristics of their portfolio(s), implement asset
allocation changes in a cost-effective manner, or reduce transaction costs. Under the managers’ investment guidelines, derivatives may not be used solely for speculation or leverage. Derivatives are used only in circumstances where they offer
the most efficient economic means of improving risk/reward profile of the portfolio.

BlackRock, PFPC and our Retail Banking business segment receive
compensation for providing investment management, trustee and custodial services for the majority of the Trust portfolio. Compensation for such services is paid by PNC. Non-affiliate service providers for the Trust are compensated from plan assets.

The following table provides information regarding our estimated future cash flows related to our various plans:

Estimated Cash Flows

The qualified pension plan contributions are deposited into the Trust, and the qualified pension plan benefit
payments are paid from the Trust. For the other plans, total contributions and the benefit payments are the same and represent expected benefit amounts, which are paid from general assets. Postretirement benefits are net of participant
contributions.



The components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost/(income) were as
follows:

The weighted-average assumptions used (as of the beginning of each year) to determine net periodic costs shown
above were as follows:

The weighted-average assumptions used (as of the end of each year) to determine year-end obligations for both
pension and postretirement benefits were as follows:

As of December 31, 2005, the discount rate assumption was determined independently for each plan reflecting
the duration of each plan’s obligations. Specifically, a yield curve was produced for a universe containing the majority of US-issued Aa grade corporate bonds, all of which were non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions). Excluded
from this yield curve were the 10% of the bonds with the highest yields and the 10% with the lowest yields. For each plan, the discount rate was determined as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value obligation as that
using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.

The health care cost trend rate assumptions shown in the preceding tables relate only to the
postretirement benefit plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was enacted. The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, known as “Medicare
Part D,” and a federal subsidy to sponsors of postretirement plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Our actuaries have attested that the benefits we provide to certain participants are at least
actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D, and, accordingly, we will be entitled to a subsidy.

In accordance with FSP 106-2, the effects of the Act were
considered an actuarial gain on December 31, 2004, and recognized in the same manner as other actuarial gains and losses. The Act reduced 2005 net periodic cost by $1 million.

We have a contributory, qualified defined contribution plan that covers substantially all employees except those covered by other plans as identified below. Under this
plan, employee contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation as defined by the plan are matched 100%, subject to Code limitations. The plan is a 401(k) plan and includes an employee stock ownership (“ESOP”) feature. Employee
contributions are invested in a number of investment options available under the plan, including a PNC common stock fund and several BlackRock mutual funds, at the direction of the employee. All shares of PNC common stock held by the plan are part
of the ESOP. Employee contributions to the plan for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were matched primarily by shares of PNC common stock held in treasury, except in the case of those participants who have exercised their diversification election rights to have
their matching portion in other investments available within the plan. Effective November 22, 2005, we amended the plan to provide all participants the ability to diversify the matching portion of their plan account invested in shares of PNC
common stock into other investments available within the plan. Prior to this



amendment, only participants age 50 or older were permitted to exercise this diversification option. Employee benefits expense related to this plan was $47
million in 2005, $48 million in 2004 and $49 million in 2003. We measured employee benefits expense as the fair value of the shares and cash contributed to the plan by PNC.

Additionally, Hilliard Lyons sponsors a contributory, qualified defined contribution plan that covers substantially all of its employees who are not covered by the plan described above. Contributions to this plan are
made in cash and include a base contribution for those participants employed at December 31, a matching of employee contributions, and a discretionary profit sharing contribution as determined by Hilliard Lyons’ Executive Compensation
Committee. Employee benefits expense for this plan was $6 million in 2005 and $5 million in both 2004 and 2003.

Effective July 1, 2004, we adopted a
separate qualified defined contribution plan that covers substantially all US-based PFPC employees not covered by our plan. The plan is a 401(k) plan and includes an ESOP feature. Under this plan, employee contributions of up to 6% of eligible
compensation as defined by the plan may be matched annually based on PFPC performance levels. Participants must be employed as of December 31 of each year to receive this annual contribution. The performance-based employer matching contribution
will be made primarily in shares of PNC common stock held in treasury, except in the case of those participants who have exercised their diversification election rights to have their matching portion in other investments available within the plan.
Mandatory employer contributions to this plan are made in cash and include employer basic and transitional contributions. Employee-directed contributions are invested in a number of investment options available under the plan, including a PNC common
stock fund and several BlackRock mutual funds, at the direction of the employee. Effective November 22, 2005, we amended the plan to provide all participants the ability to diversify the matching portion of their plan account invested in shares
of PNC common stock into other investments available within the plan. Prior to this amendment, only participants age 50 or older were permitted to exercise this diversification option. Employee benefits expense for this plan, which was effective
July 1, 2004, was $12 million in 2005 and $5 million for 2004. We measured employee benefits expense as the fair value of the shares and cash contributed to the plan.

We also maintain a nonqualified supplemental savings plan for certain employees.

We have a long-term incentive award plan (“Incentive Plan”) that provides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, performance units, and restricted stock and other incentive shares to executives and, other than incentive stock options, to non-employee directors. In any given year, the number of shares of PNC common stock available for grant
under the Incentive Plan is limited to no more than 3% of total issued shares of common stock determined at the end of the preceding calendar year. Of this amount, no more than 20% is available for restricted stock and other incentive share awards.
As of December 31, 2005 no incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights or performance unit awards were outstanding.

Options are granted at exercise prices not less than the market
value of common stock on the date of grant. Generally, options granted since 1999 become exercisable in installments after the grant date. Options granted prior to 1999 are mainly exercisable 12 months after the grant date. No option may be
exercisable after 10 years from its grant date. Payment of the option price may be in cash or previously owned shares of common stock at market value on the exercise date.

Generally, options granted under the Incentive Plan vest ratably over a three year period as long as the grantee remains an employee or, in certain cases, retires from PNC. For all options granted prior to the
adoption of SFAS 123(R), we recognized compensation expense over the three-year vesting period. If an employee retired prior to the end of the three-year vesting period, we accelerated the expensing of all unrecognized compensation costs at the
retirement date. As required upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), we will recognize compensation expense for options granted to retirement-eligible employees after January 1, 2006 within the first year of the grant date, in accordance with the service
period provisions of the Incentive Plan.

A summary of stock option activity follows:



Information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2005 follows:

Options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 include options for 30,000 shares that were granted to non-employee
directors in each year.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $8.72, $9.64, and $8.11 per option,
respectively. At December 31, 2004 and 2003 options for 12,693,000 and 10,426,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were exercisable at a weighted-average price of $56.41 and $55.21, respectively.

There were no options granted in excess of market value in 2005, 2004 or 2003. Shares of common stock available during the next year for the granting of options and
other awards under the Incentive Plan were 10,584,683 at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

As discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies, we adopted the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 prospectively to all employee awards including stock options granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003. As permitted under SFAS 123, we recognize compensation expense for stock options on a
straight-line basis over the pro rata vesting period. Compensation expense for stock options recognized in 2005 was $31 million compared with $22 million in 2004 and $12 million in 2003.

In 2003, we granted incentive share awards representing a maximum of 659,250 shares of PNC common stock to certain senior executives pursuant to the
Incentive Plan. Issuance of shares pursuant to these incentive awards was subject to the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals over a three-year period that ended December 31, 2005 and the approval of the Personnel
and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. In February 2006, the Committee approved the issuance of 549,375 shares of common stock to satisfy these incentive awards. One-half of the shares vested immediately while the other half were
issued as restricted shares with a vesting period ending December 31, 2006. Expense related to incentive share awards is recognized over the performance period and the employee service period.

In 2004, we granted incentive share awards representing a maximum of 879,000 shares of PNC common stock to certain senior executives pursuant to the Incentive Plan. In
addition, awards under this grant would be increased by the amount of phantom dividends on the awards during the performance period converted to incentive shares and added to the award amount. Issuance of shares pursuant to these incentive awards
was subject to the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals over a two-year period that ended December 31, 2005 and the approval of the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Any shares awarded
under this grant, other than those related to the conversion of phantom dividends, would be reduced on a share-for-share basis for shares issued pursuant to the 2003 incentive share awards discussed above. In February 2006, the Committee approved
the issuance of 110,812 shares of common stock to satisfy the incentive awards under this grant. One-half of the shares vested immediately while the other half were issued as restricted shares with a vesting period ending December 31, 2006.

In 2000, we granted 245,000 shares of restricted stock to senior executives with a three-year vesting period. Of these, 35,000 shares were forfeited in
2002. The restricted period for all but 40,000 of the restricted shares ended November 15, 2003.

In 2002, we granted 109,138 shares of restricted
stock to senior executives with vesting periods ranging from 24 months to 50 months. There were 737 and 1,551 restricted shares forfeited during 2004 and 2002, respectively. The restricted period for all but 48,686 shares ended during 2005.

In 2003, we granted 520,446 shares of restricted stock to senior executives with vesting periods ranging from 24 months to 47 months. There were 8,456,
2,607 and 7,062 restricted shares forfeited in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In 2004, we granted 342,188 shares of restricted stock to senior
executives with vesting periods ranging from 17 months to 43 months. Of these, 3,712 shares were forfeited in 2005 and 1,610 shares were forfeited in 2004. Additionally, we granted 369,854 shares of restricted stock to certain key employees. These
shares vest 100% after three years. Of these, 26,934 shares were forfeited in 2005 and 11,232 shares were forfeited in 2004.

In 2005, we granted 440,631
shares of restricted stock to senior executives with vesting periods ranging from 36 months to 48 months. Of these, 3,245 restricted shares were forfeited in 2005. Additionally, we granted 339,110 shares of restricted stock to certain key employees.
These shares vest 100% after three years. Of these, 24,635 restricted shares were forfeited in 2005.

We also granted 37,500, 63,500 and 67,900 shares of
restricted stock to certain key employees in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These shares vest 25% after three years, 25% after four years and 50% after five years. Shares forfeited were 11,500, 11,375 and 10,975 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.



The weighted-average grant-date fair value of incentive share and restricted stock awards granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003
was $53.81, $54.46 and $44.23 per share, respectively. We recognized compensation expense for incentive share and restricted stock awards totaling $44 million, $25 million and $20 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

A table is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies that sets forth pro forma net income and basic and diluted earnings per share as if compensation expense had been
recognized under SFAS 123, as amended, for stock options and the ESPP for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

For purposes of computing 2005 stock option expense and pro
forma results, we estimated the fair value of stock options and ESPP shares using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model requires the use of numerous assumptions, many of which are highly subjective in nature. Therefore, the pro forma
results are estimates of results of operations as if compensation expense had been recognized for all stock-based compensation plans and are not indicative of the impact on future periods.

The following assumptions were used in the option pricing model for purposes of estimating pro forma results as well as 2005 stock option expense.

•

The risk-free interest rate is based on the US Treasury yield curve;

•

The dividend yield represents average yields over the previous three-year period;

•

Volatility is measured using the fluctuation in month-end closing stock prices over a five-year period; and

•

The expected life assumption represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on a weighted average of historical option activity.

BlackRock’s long-term retention and incentive plan (“LTIP”) permits the
grant of up to $240 million in deferred compensation awards (the “LTIP Awards”), subject to the achievement of certain performance hurdles by BlackRock no later than March 2007. If the performance hurdles are achieved, up to $200 million
of the LTIP Awards will be funded with up to 4 million shares of BlackRock Class A common stock to be surrendered by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants in 2007, less income tax withholding. Shares attributable to value in excess of
our $200 million LTIP funding requirement will be available to support BlackRock’s future long-term retention and incentive programs but are not subject to surrender until the programs are approved by BlackRock’s Compensation Committee of
its Board of Directors and, as the majority shareholder, PNC. In connection with the Merrill Lynch transaction (see Note 26 Subsequent Event), we have confirmed our commitment to make available the full 4 million shares for use in the LTIP and
future long-term incentive programs and clarified with BlackRock the circumstances under which any shares remaining after satisfaction of our obligations with respect to the LTIP will be made available. As a result of establishing the circumstances
under which we will make these shares available, upon completion of the Merrill Lynch transaction, we will no longer have any approval rights with respect to any future program meeting the agreed upon standards. In addition, shares distributed to
LTIP participants in 2007 will include an option to put such distributed shares back to BlackRock at fair market value. BlackRock will fund the remainder of the LTIP Awards with up to $40 million in cash. BlackRock has granted approximately $230
million in LTIP Awards, net of forfeitures.

The LTIP Awards vest at the end of any three-month period beginning on or after January 1, 2005 and
ending on or prior to March 30, 2007 during which the average closing price of BlackRock’s common stock is at least $62 per share. During the first quarter of 2005, BlackRock’s average closing stock price exceeded the $62 threshold
and the stock price provision was met. In addition to the stock price threshold, the vesting of awards is contingent on the participants’ continued employment with BlackRock for periods ranging from two to five years through the payment date in
early 2007.

We reported pretax charges in 2004 totaling $110 million in connection with the LTIP, including $96 million in the third quarter, based upon
management’s determination during the third quarter of 2004 that the likelihood of vesting of the LTIP Awards was probable of reaching the stock price threshold. These amounts included a pro rata share of the estimated dilution of our
investment in BlackRock that is expected to occur in 2007 when we transfer shares of BlackRock stock owned by PNC to fund a portion of the LTIP Awards.

We
reported pretax expense of $64 million in 2005, including $16 million during the fourth quarter, related to the LTIP Awards.

EPORTING

We operate four major businesses engaged in providing banking, asset management and global fund processing products and services.

During the
third quarter of 2005 we reorganized our banking businesses into two units, Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking, aligning our reporting with our client base and with the organizational changes we made in connection with our
One PNC initiative. The Retail Banking business segment comprises consumer and small business customers. The Corporate & Institutional Banking business segment includes middle market and corporate customers. Amounts previously reported
under several of our former business segments (Regional Community Banking, PNC Advisors and Wholesale Banking) have been reclassified to reflect this new reporting structure. Intercompany eliminations and other adjustments made to combine Regional
Community Banking and PNC Advisors for prior periods were not significant. Our Current Reports on Form 8-K dated September 30, 2005 and December 28, 2005 contain additional information regarding this new segment reporting structure.

Assets, revenue and earnings attributable to foreign activities were not material in the periods presented.

Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and our operating structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of
guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We refine our methodologies from time to time as our
management accounting practices are enhanced and our businesses and management structure change. Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis. As permitted under GAAP, we have
aggregated the business results for certain operating segments for financial reporting purposes.

Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and
capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product maturities, duration and other factors. Capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to the banking and processing businesses using
our risk-based economic capital model. We increased the capital assigned to Retail Banking to 6% of funds to reflect the capital required for well-capitalized banks and to approximate market comparables for this business. The capital for BlackRock
and PFPC has been increased to reflect their legal entity shareholders’ equity. BlackRock’s capital is consistent with its separate public company financial statement disclosures.



We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on
our assessment of risk inherent in the loan portfolios. Our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services.

Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated results. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Intercompany
Eliminations” and “Other” categories. “Intercompany Eliminations” reflects activities conducted among our businesses that are eliminated in the consolidated results. “Other” includes residual activities that do not
meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities, related net securities gains or losses, certain trading activities, equity management activities and minority interest in income
of BlackRock, differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), and corporate overhead.

We issue standby letters of

or performance obligation to the third party under the terms of the contract, then upon the request of the guaranteed party, we would be obligated to make payment to them. The standby letters of credit and risk participations in standby letters of
credit and bankers’ acceptances outstanding on December 31, 2005 had terms ranging from less than one year to 10 years. The aggregate maximum amount of future payments we could be required to make under outstanding standby letters of
credit and risk participations in standby letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances was $6.4 billion at December 31, 2005.

Assets valued as of
December 31, 2005 of approximately $1 billion secured certain specifically identified standby letters of credit. Approximately $2.2 billion in recourse provisions from third parties was also available for this purpose as of December 31,
2005. In addition, a portion of the remaining standby letters of credit and letter of credit risk participations issued on behalf of specific customers is also secured by collateral or guarantees that secure the customers’ other obligations to
us. The carrying amount of the liability for our obligations related to standby letters of credit and risk participations in standby letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances was $60 million at December 31, 2005.

NDEMNIFICATIONS

We are a party to numerous acquisition or divestiture agreements under which we have purchased or sold, or
agreed to purchase or sell, various types of assets. These agreements can cover the purchase or sale of:

•

Entire businesses,

•

Loan portfolios,

•

Branch banks,

•

Partial interests in companies, or

•

Other types of assets.



These agreements generally include indemnification provisions under which we indemnify the third parties to these
agreements against a variety of risks to the indemnified parties as a result of the transaction in question. When PNC is the seller, the indemnification provisions will generally also provide the buyer with protection relating to the quality of the
assets we are selling and the extent of any liabilities being assumed by the buyer. Due to the nature of these indemnification provisions, we cannot quantify the total potential exposure to us resulting from them.

We provide indemnification in connection with securities offering transactions in which we are involved. When we are the issuer of the securities, we provide
indemnification to the underwriters or placement agents analogous to the indemnification provided to the purchasers of businesses from us, as described above. When we are an underwriter or placement agent, we provide a limited indemnification to the
issuer related to our actions in connection with the offering and, if there are other underwriters, indemnification to the other underwriters intended to result in an appropriate sharing of the risk of participating in the offering. Due to the
nature of these indemnification provisions, we cannot quantify the total potential exposure to us resulting from them.

We enter into certain types of
agreements that include provisions for indemnifying third parties, such as:

•

Agreements relating to providing various servicing and processing functions to third parties,

•

Agreements relating to the creation of trusts or other legal entities to facilitate leasing transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions (loan securitizations)
and certain other off-balance sheet transactions,

•

Syndicated credit agreements, as a syndicate member,

•

Sales of individual loans,

•

Arrangements with brokers to facilitate the hedging of derivative and convertible arbitrage activities, and

•

Litigation settlement agreements.

Due to the nature of these
indemnification provisions, we cannot calculate our aggregate potential exposure under them.

We enter into certain types of agreements, including leases,
assignments of leases, and subleases, in which we agree to indemnify third parties for acts by our agents, assignees and/or sublessees, and employees. While we do not believe these indemnification liabilities are material, either individually or in
total, we cannot calculate our potential exposure.

We enter into contracts for the delivery of technology service in which we indemnify the other party
against claims of patent and copyright infringement by third parties. Due to the nature of these indemnification provisions, we cannot calculate our aggregate potential exposure under this type of indemnification.

We engage in certain insurance activities which require our employees to be bonded. We satisfy this bonding requirement by issuing letters of credit in a total amount of
approximately $5 million.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts with third parties under which the third parties provide services on
behalf of PNC. In many of these contracts, we agree to indemnify the third party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnity vary from contract to contract and the amount of the indemnification liability, if any, cannot
be determined.

We are a general or limited partner in certain asset management and investment limited partnerships, many of which contain indemnification
provisions that would require us to make payments in excess of our remaining funding commitments. While in certain of these partnerships the maximum liability to us is limited to the sum of our unfunded commitments and partnership distributions
received by us, in the others the indemnification liability is unlimited. As a result, we cannot determine our aggregate potential exposure for these indemnifications.

Pursuant to their bylaws, PNC and its subsidiaries provide indemnification to directors, officers and, in some cases, employees and agents against certain liabilities incurred as a result of their service on behalf of
or at the request of PNC and its subsidiaries. PNC and its subsidiaries also advance on behalf of covered individuals costs incurred in connection with certain claims or proceedings, subject to written undertakings by each such individual to repay
all amounts so advanced if it is ultimately determined that the individual is not entitled to indemnification. We generally are responsible for similar indemnifications and advancement obligations that companies we acquire, including Riggs, had to
their officers, directors and sometimes employees and agents at the time of acquisition. We advanced such costs on behalf of several such individuals (including some from Riggs) with respect to pending litigation or investigations during 2005. It is
not possible for us to determine the aggregate potential exposure resulting from the obligation to provide this indemnity or to advance such costs.

In
connection with the lending of securities held by PFPC as an intermediary on behalf of certain of its clients, we provide indemnification to those clients against the failure of the borrowers to return the securities. The market value of the
securities lent is fully secured on a daily basis; therefore, the exposure to us is limited to temporary shortfalls in the collateral as a result of short-term fluctuations in trading prices of the loaned securities. At December 31, 2005, the
total maximum potential exposure as a result of these indemnity obligations was approximately $5 billion, although we held collateral at the time in excess of that amount.

We write caps and floors for customers, risk management and
proprietary trading purposes. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of the written caps and floors liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was $14 million. Our ultimate obligation under written options is based on future market conditions
and is only quantifiable at settlement. We manage our market risk exposure from customer positions through transactions with third-party dealers.



We also enter into credit default swaps under which we buy loss protection from or sell loss protection to a counterparty
in the event of default of a reference obligation. The fair value of the contracts sold on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was a net asset of $3 million at December 31, 2005. The maximum amount we would be required to pay under the credit
default swaps in which we sold protection, assuming all reference obligations default at a total loss, without recoveries, was $396 million at December 31, 2005. We purchased $343 million notional of credit default swaps to mitigate the
exposure of certain written credit default swaps at December 31, 2005.

We have entered into various contingent performance guarantees through credit
risk participation arrangements with terms ranging from less than 1 year to 12 years. We will be required to make payments under these guarantees if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under certain credit agreements with third parties.
Our exposure under these agreements is approximately $179 million at December 31, 2005.

On February 15, 2006, we announced that BlackRock and Merrill Lynch had entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Merrill Lynch will contribute its
investment management business to BlackRock in exchange for newly issued BlackRock common and preferred stock. Upon the closing of this transaction, which we expect to occur on or around September 30, 2006, Merrill Lynch will own an approximate 49%
economic interest in BlackRock.

As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 70% of BlackRock. Upon closing of this transaction, the carrying
value of our investment in BlackRock will increase and, as a result, we will recognize an after-tax gain. We will deconsolidate BlackRock from PNC’s financial statements as required under generally accepted accounting principles and account for
our investment in BlackRock under the equity method of accounting. We will continue to own approximately 44.5 million shares of BlackRock common stock, representing an ownership interest of approximately 34% of the larger company, and will have
two seats on BlackRock’s Board of Directors including one director on the Executive Committee.

This transaction must be approved by BlackRock
shareholders and is subject to obtaining appropriate regulatory and other approvals. We currently control more than 80% of the voting interest in BlackRock and will vote our interest in support of the transaction.

Additional information on this transaction is included in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed February 15, 2006 and February 22, 2006 and in BlackRock’s

Amounts for 2005 reflect the impact of a $53 million loan recovery in that year. Excluding this recovery, net charge-offs would have been .18% of average loans and the allowance as

Excluding $714 million of provision in 2001 related to the institutional lending repositioning initiative, provision for credit losses would have been .42% of average loans.

The following table presents the assignment of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the categories of loans as a percentage of total
loans. Changes in the allocation over time reflect the changes in loan portfolio composition, risk profile and refinements to reserve methodologies. For purposes of this presentation, a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses has been
assigned to loan categories based on the relative specific and pool allocation amounts to provide coverage for probable losses not covered in specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies related to qualitative and measurement factors. At

ITEM 9A – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (“PNC”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. The internal control
system is augmented by written policies and procedures and by audits performed by an internal audit staff, which reports to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Internal auditors test the operation of the internal control system and report
findings to management and the Audit Committee, and appropriate corrective and other actions are taken to address identified control deficiencies and other opportunities for improving the system. The Audit Committee, composed solely of independent
directors, provides oversight to management’s conduct of the financial reporting process.

There are inherent limitations in the
effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability
of financial reporting and financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.

We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of PNC’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that PNC maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
Report, has issued a report on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of PNC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP follows.

(b)

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

We have audited
management’s assessment, included in the accompanying “Management’s Responsibility For Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding



prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended of the Company and our report dated March 3,
2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Internal Controls and Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2005, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our internal control over financial reporting.

Based on
that evaluation, our management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2005, and that there has been no change
in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
