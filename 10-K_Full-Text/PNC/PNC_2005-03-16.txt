VERVIEW

We are one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United
States, operating businesses engaged in regional community banking, wholesale banking, wealth management, asset management, and global fund processing services. We operate directly and through numerous subsidiaries, providing many of our products
and services nationally and others in our primary geographic markets in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Ohio and Kentucky. We also provide certain asset management and global fund processing services internationally. At December 31, 2004, our
consolidated total assets, deposits and shareholders’ equity were $79.7 billion, $53.3 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively.

We were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1983 with the consolidation of Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National
Corporation. Since 1983, we have diversified our geographical presence, business mix and product capabilities through internal growth and strategic bank and non-bank acquisitions and the formation of various non-banking subsidiaries.

We include information on significant recent acquisitions and a pending acquisition in Note 3
Acquisitions and Note 31 Subsequent Events and include information on divestitures in Note 6 Discontinued Operations of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and here by reference.

Regional Community Banking

Regional
Community Banking provides deposit, lending, and cash management services, and investment services through PNC Investments, LLC, to approximately 2.2 million consumer and small business customers within PNC’s primary geographic footprint.

Our goal is to generate sustainable revenue growth by consistently increasing
our customer base. We seek additional revenue growth by attempting to sell additional products and services to these customers.

In addition, we are focused on optimizing our network of branches by opening stand-alone and in-store branches in attractive sites while consolidating or selling branches
with less opportunity for growth.



We completed our acquisition of United National Bancorp, Inc. (“United National”) on January 1, 2004. United
National shareholders received an aggregate of approximately $321 million in cash and 6.6 million shares of our common stock valued at $360 million. As a result of the acquisition, we added $3.7 billion of assets (including $.6 billion of goodwill),
$2.3 billion of deposits, $1.0 billion of borrowed funds and $.4 billion of shareholders’ equity to our Average Consolidated Balance Sheet for the quarter ended March 31, 2004.

Wholesale Banking

Wholesale Banking
provides lending, treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial loan servicing to mid-sized corporations, government entities and selectively to large corporations. Lending products include secured and unsecured
loans, letters of credit and equipment leases. Treasury management services include cash and investment management, receivables management, disbursement services, funds transfer services, information reporting and global trade services. Capital
markets products include foreign exchange, derivatives, loan syndications and securities underwriting and distribution. Wholesale Banking provides products and services generally within our primary geographic markets and provides certain products
and services nationally.

under management at December 31, 2004. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, liquidity and equity mutual funds, separate accounts and alternative investment
products. Mutual funds include the flagship fund families,

value. BlackRock’s strategies for growth in assets under management include a focus on achieving client investment performance objectives while maintaining stringent risk controls and providing best in class client service. The business
dedicates significant resources to attracting and retaining talented professionals and to the ongoing enhancement of its investment technology and operating capabilities to deliver on its strategy.

BlackRock is approximately 71% owned by PNC and is consolidated into PNC’s financial
statements. Accordingly, approximately 29% of BlackRock’s earnings are recognized as minority interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

Effective January 31, 2005, BlackRock acquired SSRM Holdings, Inc. (“SSRM”), the holding company of State Street Research & Management Company and SSR
Realty Advisors Inc., from MetLife, Inc. SSRM, through its subsidiaries, actively manages stock, bond, balanced and real estate portfolios for both institutional and individual investors with approximately $55 billion in assets under management at
December 31, 2004. At closing, MetLife, Inc. received approximately $285 million in cash and approximately 550,000 shares of BlackRock restricted class A common stock. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to BlackRock’s
earnings. Additional cash consideration, which could increase the purchase price by up to 25%, may be paid over 5 years contingent on certain measures.

You should also review Note 31 Subsequent Events of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding the transfer of BlackRock from PNC

EGULATION

Overview

PNC is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended (“BHC Act”) and a
financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB Act”).

We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, some of which are highlighted below. You should also read Note 4 Regulatory Matters of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information
regarding our regulatory issues. Applicable laws and regulations restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, mutual fund and other customers, among other things.
They also restrict our ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from bank subsidiaries and impose capital adequacy requirements. The consequences of noncompliance can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions.

In addition, we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by, among other
regulatory bodies, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). We are subject to examination by these regulators, which results in
examination reports and ratings (which are not publicly available) that can impact the conduct and growth of our businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality
and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. An examination downgrade by any of our federal bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant limitations on our activities and
growth.

These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose
restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and
regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations.

We are also subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) by virtue of our status as a public company
and due to the nature of some of our businesses.

As a regulated financial
services firm, our relationships and good standing with regulators are of fundamental importance to the continuation and growth of our businesses. The Federal Reserve, OCC, SEC, and other domestic and foreign regulators have broad enforcement
powers, and powers to approve, deny, or refuse to act upon our applications or notices to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations.

Over the last several years, there has been an increasing regulatory focus on compliance with
anti-money laundering laws and regulations, resulting in, among other things, several significant publicly announced enforcement actions, including those relating to Riggs National Corporation. In response to this environment, we are working to
enhance our procedures for compliance with these laws and regulations.

There
are numerous rules governing the regulation of financial services institutions and their holding companies. Accordingly, the following discussion is general in nature and does not purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws and regulations
that apply to us.

Bank Regulation

As a bank holding company and a financial holding company, we are subject to supervision and regular inspection by the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiary banks and their
subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by applicable federal and state banking agencies, principally the OCC with respect to PNC Bank, N.A. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Office of the State
Bank Commissioner of Delaware with respect to PNC Bank, Delaware.

Parent
Company Liquidity and Dividends

. The principal source of our liquidity at the parent company level is dividends from PNC Bank, N.A. Our subsidiary banks are subject to various federal and state restrictions on their ability to pay dividends
to PNC Bancorp, Inc., the direct parent of the subsidiary banks, which in turn may affect the ability of PNC Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends to PNC at the parent company level. Our subsidiary banks are also subject to federal laws limiting extensions
of credit to their parent holding company and non-bank affiliates as discussed in Note 4 Regulatory Matters of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. Further information is
also available in the Liquidity Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.

Under Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such bank. Consistent with the “source of strength”
policy for subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been
sufficient



to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the corporation’s capital needs, asset quality
and overall financial condition. This policy does not currently have a negative impact on PNC’s ability to pay dividends at our current level.

Additional Powers Under the GLB Act

. The GLB Act permits a qualifying bank holding company to become a “financial holding company” and thereby to
affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company. Permitted affiliates include securities underwriters and dealers, insurance companies and companies engaged in
other activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or are determined by the Federal Reserve unilaterally to be
“complementary” to financial activities. We became a financial holding company as of March 13, 2000.

The Federal Reserve is the “umbrella” regulator of a financial holding company, with its operating entities, such as its subsidiary broker-dealers, investment managers, investment companies, insurance
companies and banks, also subject to the jurisdiction of various federal and state “functional” regulators with normal regulatory responsibility for companies in their lines of business.

As subsidiaries of a financial holding company under the GLB Act, our non-bank subsidiaries
are allowed to conduct new financial activities or acquire non-bank financial companies with after-the-fact notice to the Federal Reserve. In addition, our non-bank subsidiaries (and any financial subsidiaries of subsidiary banks) are now permitted
to engage in certain activities that were not permitted for banks and bank holding companies prior to enactment of the GLB Act, and to engage on less restrictive terms in certain activities that were previously permitted. Among other activities, we
currently rely on our status as a financial holding company to conduct mutual fund distribution activities, merchant banking activities, and underwriting and dealing activities.

To continue to qualify for financial holding company status, our subsidiary banks must maintain “well capitalized” capital ratios,
examination ratings of “1” or “2” (on a scale of 1 to 5), and certain other criteria that are incorporated into the definition of “well managed” under the BHC Act and Federal Reserve rules. If we were to no longer
qualify for this status, we could not continue to enjoy the after-the-fact notice process for new non-banking activities and non-banking acquisitions, and would be required promptly to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve providing a
plan for our subsidiary banks to meet the “well capitalized” and “well managed” criteria. The Federal Reserve would have broad authority to limit our activities. Failure to satisfy the criteria within a six-month period could
result in a requirement that we conform existing non-banking activities to activities that were permissible prior to the enactment of the GLB Act. If a subsidiary bank failed to maintain a “satisfactory” or better rating under the
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (“CRA”), we could not commence new activities or make new investments in reliance on the GLB Act.

In addition, the GLB Act permits a national bank, such as PNC Bank, N.A., to engage in expanded activities through the formation of a “financial subsidiary.” In
order to qualify to establish or acquire a financial subsidiary, PNC Bank, N.A. and each of its depository institution affiliates must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” and may not have a less than “satisfactory”
CRA rating. A national bank that is one of the largest 50 insured banks in the United States, such as PNC Bank, N.A., must also have issued debt (which, for this purpose, may include the uninsured portion of PNC Bank, N.A.’s long-term
certificates of deposit) with certain minimum ratings. Although PNC Bank, N.A. does not currently have any financial subsidiaries, it has filed a financial subsidiary certification with the OCC and thus could engage through a financial subsidiary in
any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity, with certain exceptions. These activities generally include insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development, and merchant banking.

If one of our subsidiary banks were to fail to meet the “well
capitalized” or “well managed” and related criteria, PNC Bank, N.A. would be required to enter into an agreement with the OCC to correct the condition. The OCC would have the authority to limit the activities of the bank. If the
condition were not corrected within six months or within any additional time granted by the OCC, PNC Bank, N.A. could be required to conform the activities of any of its financial subsidiaries to activities in which a national bank could engage
directly. In addition, if the bank or any insured depository institution affiliate receives a less than satisfactory CRA examination rating, PNC Bank, N.A. would not be permitted to engage in any new activities or to make new investments in reliance
on the financial subsidiary authority.

Other Federal Reserve and OCC
Regulation

. The federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective action as deemed appropriate for an insured depository institution and its holding company. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in
question is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Generally, the smaller an
institution’s capital base in relation to its total assets, the greater the scope and severity of the agencies’ powers, ultimately permitting the agencies to appoint a receiver for the institution. Business activities may also be
influenced by an institution’s capital classification. For instance, only a “well capitalized” depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval and an “adequately capitalized” depository
institution may accept brokered deposits only with prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2004, both of our subsidiary banks exceeded the required ratios for classification as “well capitalized.” For additional discussion of capital
adequacy requirements, we refer you to “Capital And Funding Sources” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report and to Note 4 Regulatory Matters of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
this Report.

Laws and regulations limit the scope of our permitted activities
and investments. In addition to the activities that



would be permitted a financial subsidiary, national banks (such as PNC Bank, N.A.) and their operating subsidiaries may engage in any activities that are
determined by the OCC to be part of or incidental to the business of banking.

Moreover, examination ratings of “3” or lower, lower capital ratios than peer group institutions, regulatory concerns regarding management, controls, assets, operations or other factors, can all potentially result in practical
limitations on the ability of a bank or bank holding company to engage in new activities, grow, acquire new businesses, repurchase its stock or pay dividends, or to continue to conduct existing activities.

The Federal Reserve’s prior approval is required whenever we propose to acquire all or
substantially all of the assets of any bank or thrift, to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank or thrift, or to merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company or thrift holding
company. When reviewing bank acquisition applications for approval, the Federal Reserve considers, among other things, each subsidiary bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves in accordance with the CRA. At
December 31, 2004, both of our bank subsidiaries, PNC Bank, N.A. and PNC Bank, Delaware, were rated “outstanding” with respect to CRA. Our ability to grow through acquisitions could be limited by these approval requirements.

FDIC Insurance

. Both of our subsidiary banks are insured by the FDIC and
subject to premium assessments. Regulatory matters could increase the cost of FDIC deposit insurance premiums to an insured bank. Since 1996, the FDIC has not assessed banks in the most favorable capital and assessment risk classification categories
for insurance premiums for most deposits, due to the favorable ratio of the assets in the FDIC’s deposit insurance funds to the aggregate level of insured deposits outstanding. This has resulted in significant cost savings to all insured banks.
Deposit insurance premiums are assessed as a percentage of the deposits of the insured institution. If the FDIC assesses premiums for all deposits, it would impose a significant cost to all insured banks, including our subsidiary banks, reducing the
net spread between deposit and other bank funding costs and the earnings from assets and services of the bank, and thus the net income of the bank. FDIC deposit insurance premiums are “risk based”; therefore, higher fee percentages would
be charged to banks that have lower capital ratios or higher risk profiles. These risk profiles may take into account weaknesses that are found by the primary banking regulator through its examination and supervision of the bank. A negative
evaluation by the FDIC or a bank’s primary federal banking regulator could increase the costs to a bank and result in an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher than that of competing banks in a lower risk category.

Our subsidiary banks are subject to “cross-guarantee” provisions under federal law
that provide that if one of these banks fails or requires FDIC assistance, the FDIC may assess a “commonly-controlled” bank for the estimated losses suffered by the FDIC. Such liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or that of the assessed bank. While the FDIC’s claim is junior to the claims of depositors, holders of secured liabilities, general creditors and subordinated creditors, it is superior to the claims of our shareholders and affiliates,
including PNC and intermediate bank holding companies.

Recent
Transaction: BlackRock Restructuring

. In January 2005, PNC Bank, N.A. transferred BlackRock, Inc., one of its operating subsidiaries, to PNC Bancorp, Inc. This transaction resulted in a net reduction in regulatory capital for PNC Bank, N.A.
of approximately $500 million. As a condition for regulatory approval of this transfer, PNC Bank, N.A. issued a new series of perpetual non-cumulative preferred shares to PNC totaling $500 million, thus maintaining the risk-based capital and
leverage ratios of PNC Bank, N.A. at approximately the same level as before the BlackRock restructuring. See Note 31 Subsequent Events in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further information.

Securities and Related Regulation

The SEC, together with either the OCC or the Federal Reserve, regulates our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries, including one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries. These
subsidiaries are also subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD”), among others. Hilliard Lyons is also a member of the New York Stock Exchange and subject to its
regulations and supervision. Three subsidiaries, including one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, are registered as commodity pool operators with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association, and are subject to
regulation by them.

Several of our subsidiaries, including some of
BlackRock’s subsidiaries, are registered with the SEC as investment advisers and, therefore, are subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the SEC’s regulations thereunder. The principal purpose of the
regulations applicable to investment advisers is the protection of clients and the securities markets, rather than the protection of creditors and shareholders of investment advisers. The regulations applicable to investment advisers cover all
aspects of the investment advisory business, including limitations on the ability of investment advisers to charge performance-based or non-refundable fees to clients; record-keeping; operational, marketing and reporting requirements; disclosure
requirements; limitations on principal transactions between an adviser or its affiliates and advisory clients; as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions. Our investment advisory subsidiaries also may be subject to state securities laws and
regulations. In addition, our investment adviser subsidiaries, such as some BlackRock subsidiaries, that are investment advisors to registered investment companies and other managed accounts are subject to the requirements of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, and the SEC’s regulations thereunder.

Additional
legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC, other federal and state regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may directly affect the method of
operation and profitability of investment advisers. The profitability of investment advisers could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial



communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.

Recently, the SEC and other governmental agencies have been investigating the mutual fund
industry. The SEC has adopted and proposed various rules, and legislation has been introduced in Congress, intended to reform the regulation of this industry. The effect of regulatory reform has been, and is likely to continue, to increase the
extent of regulation of the mutual fund industry and impose additional compliance obligations and costs on our subsidiaries involved with the mutual fund industry.

Under various provisions of the federal securities laws (including in particular those applicable to broker-dealers, investment advisers and
registered investment companies and their service providers), a determination by a court or regulatory agency that certain violations have occurred at a company or its affiliates can result in a limitation of permitted activities, disqualification
to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations can also affect a public company in its timing and ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the
capital markets. In addition, expansion of activities of a broker-dealer generally requires approval of the New York Stock Exchange and/or NASD, and regulators may take into account a variety of considerations in acting upon such applications,
including internal controls, capital, management experience and quality, and supervisory concerns.

For additional information about the regulation of BlackRock, we refer you to the discussion under the “Regulation” section of Item 1 Business in BlackRock’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K,
which may be obtained electronically at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

C

OMPETITION

We are subject to intense competition from various financial institutions and from non-bank entities that
engage in similar activities without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions.

In making loans, our subsidiary banks compete with traditional banking institutions as well as consumer finance companies, leasing companies and other non-bank lenders. Loan pricing and credit standards are under
competitive pressure as lenders seek to deploy capital and a broader range of borrowers have access to capital markets. Traditional deposit activities are subject to pricing pressures and customer migration as a result of intense competition for
consumer investment dollars.

Our subsidiary banks compete for deposits with
the following:

•

Other commercial banks,

•

Savings banks,

•

Savings and loan associations,

•

Credit unions,

•

Treasury management service companies,

•

Insurance companies, and

•

Issuers of commercial paper and other securities, including mutual funds.

Our various non-bank subsidiaries engaged in investment banking and private equity activities compete with the following:

•

Commercial banks,

•

Investment banking firms,

•

Merchant banks,

•

Insurance companies,

•

Private equity firms, and

•

Other investment vehicles.

In providing asset management services, our subsidiaries compete with the following:

•

Investment management firms,

•

Large banks and other financial institutions,

•

Brokerage firms,

•

Mutual fund complexes, and

•

Insurance companies.

The fund servicing business is also highly competitive, with a relatively small number of providers. Merger, acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry has also impacted the number of
existing or potential fund servicing clients and has intensified competition.

The ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry. Technology is not only important with respect to delivery of financial services, but in processing information.
Each of our businesses consistently must make significant technological investments to remain competitive.

We include the additional information under “Competition,” “Asset Management Performance” and “Fund Servicing” within the Risk Factors section of Item 7 of this Report here by reference.

ROCEEDINGS

There are several pending judicial or
administrative proceedings or other matters arising out of the three 2001 transactions (the “PAGIC transactions”) that gave rise to a financial statement restatement we announced on January 29, 2002 and that were the subject of a July 2002
consent order between PNC and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and a June 2003 Deferred Prosecution Agreement between the United States Department of Justice and PNC ICLC Corp., one of our indirect non-bank subsidiaries. These
pending proceedings or other matters are described below. Among the requirements of the June 2003 Deferred Prosecution Agreement was the establishment of a Restitution Fund through our $90 million contribution. The Restitution Fund will be available
to satisfy claims, including for the settlement of the pending securities litigation referred to below. Louis W. Fryman, chairman of Fox Rothschild LLP in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is administering the Restitution Fund.

In December 2004 and January 2005, we entered into settlement agreements relating to certain
of the lawsuits and other claims arising out of the PAGIC transactions. These settlements are described below, following a description of each of these pending proceedings and other matters.

The several putative class action complaints filed during 2002 in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania arising out of the PAGIC transactions have been consolidated in a consolidated class action complaint brought on behalf of purchasers of our common stock between July 19, 2001 and July 18, 2002 (the
“Class Period”). The consolidated class action complaint names PNC, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer, our Controller, and our independent auditors for 2001 as defendants and seeks unquantified
damages, interest, attorneys’ fees and other expenses. The consolidated class action complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws related to disclosures regarding the PAGIC transactions and related matters.

In August 2002, the United States Department of Labor began a formal investigation of the
Administrative Committee of our Incentive Savings Plan (“Plan”) in connection with the Administrative Committee’s conduct relating to our common stock held by the Plan. Both the Administrative Committee and PNC are cooperating fully
with the investigation. In June 2003, the Administrative Committee retained Independent Fiduciary Services, Inc. (“IFS”) to serve as an independent fiduciary charged with the exclusive authority and responsibility to act on behalf of the
Plan in connection with the pending securities litigation referred to above and to evaluate any legal rights the Plan might have against any parties relating to the PAGIC transactions. This authority includes representing the Plan’s interests
in connection with the Restitution Fund set up under the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The Department of Labor has communicated with IFS in connection with the engagement.

We received a letter in June 2003 on behalf of an alleged shareholder demanding that we take appropriate legal action against our Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer, and our Controller, as well as any other individuals or entities allegedly responsible for causing damage to PNC as a result of the PAGIC transactions. The Board referred this matter
to a special committee of the Board for evaluation. The special committee has completed its evaluation and reported its findings to the Board of Directors and to counsel for the alleged shareholder. The special committee recommended against bringing
any claims against our current or former executive officers but made certain recommendations with respect to resolution of potential claims we have with respect to certain other third parties.



In July 2003, the lead underwriter on our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage filed a lawsuit for a declaratory
judgment against PNC and PNC ICLC in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The complaint seeks a determination that the defendants breached the terms and conditions of the policy and, as a result, the policy does
not provide coverage for any loss relating to or arising out of the Department of Justice investigation or the PAGIC transactions. Alternatively, the complaint seeks a determination that the policy does not provide coverage for the payments made
pursuant to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The complaint also seeks attorneys’ fees and costs. In July 2004, the court granted our motion to stay the action until resolution of the claims against PNC in the pending securities litigation
described above.

On December 17, 2004, we entered into a tentative settlement
of the consolidated putative class actions, reflected in a Memorandum of Understanding between the plaintiffs and PNC, our former and current executive officers who are defendants in the lawsuit, and AIG Financial Products Corp.

The tentative settlement is subject to completion of final documentation, court approval and
other conditions, including some that are outside the control of the parties.

At the same time, we settled all claims between us, on the one hand, and AIG Financial Products and its affiliate, American International Surplus Lines Insurance Company (“AISLIC”), on the other hand, related to the PAGIC
transactions. AIG Financial Products was our counterparty in the PAGIC transactions, and AISLIC is one of the insurers under our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage. Subsequently, we settled claims against one of the other insurers under our
Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage.

The following are the key elements
of these settlements:

•

Payments into Settlement Fund

. The insurers under our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage will pay $30 million into a Settlement Fund for the benefit of the class. AIG
Financial Products will pay $4 million into the Settlement Fund to settle potential claims by the plaintiffs against it.

The plaintiffs have been in contact with Mr. Fryman, the administrator of the Restitution Fund, and intend to coordinate the administration and distribution of the Settlement Fund
with the distribution of the Restitution Fund.

Neither PNC nor any of our current or former officers, directors or employees will be required to contribute any funds to this settlement.

•

Assignment of Claims

. We are assigning to the plaintiffs claims we may have against the non-settling defendant in this lawsuit and all other unaffiliated third parties (other
than AIG Financial Products and its predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and their respective directors, officers and employees (collectively, “AIG”)) relating to the subject matter of the lawsuit.

•

Pending Insurance Claim

. At the time of the Memorandum of Understanding, we settled our claim against AISLIC related to our contribution of $90 million to the Restitution
Fund for $11.25 million, which represents a portion of AISLIC’s share of our overall claim. In January 2005, we settled with another insurer for an aggregate payment to us of $4.5 million, which represents a portion of their share of our
overall claim. We will be preserving our claim against our insurers with whom we have not settled with respect to, among other things, any amounts disbursed out of the Restitution Fund.

•

Other AIG Claims

. We and AIG Financial Products settled all other claims between us arising out of the PAGIC transactions for a payment from us of $2 million.

•

Other Claims

. In connection with the settlement of the lawsuit, the claims of IFS on behalf of our Incentive Savings Plan and its participants will be resolved and the class
covered by the settlement will be expanded to include participants in the Plan. The Department of Labor is not, however, a party to this settlement and thus the settlement does not necessarily resolve its investigation.

In addition, the settlement of this lawsuit will resolve the derivative
claims asserted by one of our putative shareholders and any other derivative demands that may be filed in connection with the PAGIC transactions.

•

Releases

. We will be releasing the insurers providing our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage from any further liability to PNC arising out of the events that gave rise
to the lawsuit, except for the claims against these insurers (other than those with whom we have settled) relating to the $90 million payment to the Restitution Fund.

PNC and AIG are releasing each other with respect to all claims between us arising out of the PAGIC transactions.

We will be responsible for the costs of administering the settlement and the Restitution Fund
and may incur additional costs in the future in connection with the advancement of expenses and/or indemnification obligations related to the subject matter of this lawsuit. We do not expect such costs to be material. The net payment from AIG was
recognized in our income statement in the fourth quarter of 2004, while the payments from the other insurer with whom we have settled will be recognized in the first quarter of 2005.



Some of our subsidiaries are defendants (or have potential contractual contribution obligations to other defendants) in
several pending lawsuits brought during late 2002 and 2003 arising out of the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications Corporation. There also are threatened additional proceedings arising out of the same matters. One of the lawsuits is pending in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York and has been brought on Adelphia’s behalf as an adversary proceeding by the unsecured creditors’ committee in Adelphia’s bankruptcy proceeding. A motion to intervene
on behalf of the equity committee is also pending in this case. The other lawsuits (one of which is a putative consolidated class action) have been brought by holders of debt and equity securities of Adelphia and have been consolidated for pretrial
purposes in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. These lawsuits arise out of lending and securities underwriting activities engaged in by these PNC subsidiaries together with other financial services companies. In
the aggregate, more than 400 other financial services companies and numerous other companies and individuals have been named as defendants in one or more of the lawsuits. Collectively, with respect to some or all of the defendants, the lawsuits
allege violations of federal securities laws, violations of common law duties, aiding and abetting such violations, voidable preference payments, and fraudulent transfers, among other matters. The lawsuits seek unquantified monetary damages,
interest, attorneys’ fees and other expenses, and a return of the alleged voidable preference and fraudulent transfer payments, among other remedies. We believe that we have substantial defenses to the claims against us in these lawsuits and
intend to defend them vigorously. These lawsuits are currently in initial stages and present complex issues of law and fact. As a result, we are not currently capable of evaluating our exposure, if any, resulting from these lawsuits.

On December 30, 2004, a putative class action was filed against PNC; PNC Bank, N.A.; our
Pension Plan and its Pension Committee in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint claims violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), arising out
of the January 1, 1999 conversion of our Pension Plan from a traditional defined benefit formula to a “cash balance” defined benefit formula, and the design and continued operation of the Plan. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all
current and former employee-participants in and beneficiaries of the Plan on December 31, 1998 and on or after January 1, 1999. The plaintiffs are seeking damages and equitable relief available under ERISA, including interest, costs, and
attorneys’ fees. We believe that we have substantial defenses to the claims against us in this lawsuit and intend to defend it vigorously.

In connection with industry-wide investigations of practices in the mutual fund industry including market timing, late day trading, employee trading in mutual funds and
other matters, several of our subsidiaries have received requests for information and other inquiries from state and federal governmental and regulatory authorities. These subsidiaries are fully cooperating in all of these matters.

In addition to the proceedings or other matters described above, PNC and persons to whom we
may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present
time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us, whether
in the proceedings or other matters specifically described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period.

PNC is one of the
largest diversified financial services companies in the United States, operating businesses engaged in regional community banking, wholesale banking, wealth management, asset management and global fund processing services. We operate directly and
through numerous subsidiaries, providing many of our products and services nationally and others in our primary geographic markets in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Ohio and Kentucky. We also provide certain asset management and global fund
processing services internationally.

Our strategy to enhance shareholder value centers on achieving growth in our lines of business
underpinned by prudent risk and capital management. In each of our business segments, the primary drivers of growth are the acquisition, expansion and retention of customer relationships. We strive to achieve such growth in our customer base by
providing convenient banking options, leading technological systems and a broad range of asset management products and services. We also intend to grow through appropriate and targeted acquisitions and, in certain businesses, by expanding into new
geographical markets.

In recent years, we have managed interest rate risk
toward achieving a moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Our actions have created a balance sheet characterized by strong asset quality and significant flexibility to take
advantage, where appropriate, of rising interest rates. We anticipate that interest rates will continue to rise in 2005 and that the overall impact of a rise in long-term interest rates will be beneficial to us.

Effective January 31, 2005, our majority-owned subsidiary BlackRock acquired SSRM Holdings,
Inc. (“SSRM”), the holding company for State Street Research & Management Company and SSR Realty Advisors Inc., from MetLife, Inc. At closing, MetLife, Inc. received approximately $285 million in cash and approximately 550,000 shares
of BlackRock restricted class A common stock. Additional cash consideration, which could increase the purchase price by up to 25%, may be paid over five years contingent on certain measures. We expect that the addition of SSRM will enhance
BlackRock’s investment management platform with additional U.S. equity, alternative investment and real estate equity management capabilities, expanding the universe of products offered to institutional and individual investors worldwide.

On February 10, 2005, we entered into an amended and restated agreement to
acquire Riggs National Corporation (“Riggs”), a Washington, D.C. based banking company, replacing the original acquisition agreement entered into July 16, 2004. The transaction will give us a substantial presence on which to build a market
leading franchise in the affluent Washington metropolitan area. The total consideration under the amended and restated agreement is comprised of a fixed number of approximately 6.4 million shares of PNC common stock and $286 million in cash, subject
to adjustment. The merger is subject to closing conditions including, among others, receipt of regulatory approvals and waivers and approval of the Riggs shareholders. Our Current Reports on Form 8-K dated July 16, 2004, July 22, 2004 and February
10, 2005 provide additional information on this pending acquisition. The Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger for this transaction is included as Exhibit 10.31 to this Report.

We include additional information on Riggs and SSRM in Note 3 Acquisitions in the Notes To

ERFORMANCE

Our financial performance is substantially affected by several external factors outside of our control, including:

•

General economic conditions,

•

Loan demand,

•

Interest rates,

•

The shape of the interest rate yield curve, and

•

The performance of the capital markets.

We seek a moderate risk profile in the management of our businesses to limit the risk of loss resulting from quickly changing market conditions. We focus on the
development and management of our customer franchises to generate longer-term growth in revenue and earnings.

During 2004, we achieved success in growing our business segments, with customer growth and retention improving in a number of key areas. We believe such growth enhances our overall value by increasing revenues that
are less susceptible to changes in economic and market conditions. Noninterest income increased by 9% in 2004 compared with 2003. This improvement reflects, among other things, growth in fee-based customer revenues.

Economic factors, particularly low interest rates, continued to pressure net interest income
through the first half of 2004. Loan demand increased during the second half of the year. While we expect interest rates to continue to rise and loan demand to continue to increase, we cannot predict the timing and magnitude of these increases with
certainty. To some extent, the benefits of rising interest rates and increases in loan demand will trail these increases.



In addition to changes in general economic conditions, including the direction, timing and magnitude of movement in
interest rates and the performance of the capital markets, our success in 2005 will depend, among other things, upon:

•

Further success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers,

•

Growth in market share across businesses,

•

Disciplined expense control and improved efficiency,

•

Maintaining strong overall asset quality,

•

Prudent risk and capital management, and

•

Successful completion of the acquisition and integration of Riggs.

As described in Note 31 Subsequent Events in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, the transfer of BlackRock from PNC Bank, N.A., to
PNC Bancorp, Inc. will have an impact on our first quarter 2005 earnings.

Consolidated net income for 2004 was $1.197 billion or $4.21
per diluted share compared with $1.001 billion or $3.55 per diluted share for 2003.

Results for 2004 reflected the impact of charges totaling $49 million after taxes, or $.17 per diluted share, related to the 2002 BlackRock Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). This LTIP is described under “2002
BlackRock Long-Term Incentive Plan” in the Critical Accounting Policies and Judgments section of Item 7 of this Report.

Results for 2003 included expenses totaling $87 million after taxes, or $.31 per diluted share, in connection with the agreement with the United States Department of
Justice (“DOJ”), including related legal and consulting costs, which we describe in Item 3 of this Report and in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 23, 2004. Net income for 2003 also included the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle that negatively impacted earnings by $28 million, or $.10 per diluted share.

Return on average common shareholders’ equity was 16.82% for 2004 and 15.06% for 2003. Return on average assets was 1.59% in 2004 and 1.49% for 2003.

Our performance in 2004 included the following accomplishments:

•

We successfully integrated United National that we acquired in January 2004,

•

Average loans increased 14% in 2004 compared with 2003 and average deposits increased 12% driven by the impact of the United National acquisition and customer growth,

•

Overall asset quality improved significantly as nonperforming assets at December 31, 2004 declined 47% from December 31, 2003,

•

Noninterest income increased 9% for the year compared with 2003 and now represents 64% of total revenue,

•

Assets under management grew 8% from the prior year-end, to $383 billion, driven largely by BlackRock performance, and

•

Total business segment earnings grew 8% in 2004, to $1.266 billion, compared with 2003.

See Note 25 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a reconciliation of total
business segment earnings to total PNC consolidated earnings as reported on a GAAP basis, and see Net Interest Income—GAAP Reconciliation in the Consolidated Statement of Income Review section of Item 7 of this Report for a reconciliation of

Total average assets were $75.3 billion
for 2004 compared with $67.3 billion for 2003. Average interest-earning assets were $61.8 billion in 2004 compared with $55.2 billion in 2003, an increase of $6.6 billion, or 12%. The increase in average interest-earning assets in 2004 primarily
resulted from an increase of $6.2 billion in average loans and securities due to organic growth, the January 2004 United National acquisition that added $1.9 billion of loans, and the comparative impact of our adoption of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” (“FIN 46”) in the second half of 2003.

During the third quarter of 2004, we reclassified on our Consolidated Balance Sheet certain assets related to the Market Street Funding
Corporation (“Market Street”) conduit from purchased customer receivables to loans. These assets totaled $2.3 billion at December 31, 2004 and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2003. Our average total loans for 2004 included $1.9 billion
related to Market Street while our average total loans for 2003 included $1.2 billion as a result of Market Street.

Average loans for 2004 were $40.9 billion compared with $35.9 billion in 2003, an increase of $5.0 billion or 14%. Apart from the comparative impact of Market Street as a
result of our adoption of FIN 46 as described above, the increase in average total loans was primarily attributable to growth in home equity loans of approximately $2.7 billion and commercial loans of approximately $1.3 billion, including the
addition of loans from the United National acquisition. The effect of these increases was partially offset by a $.6 billion decline in lease financing loans. During the second quarter of 2004, we sold our vehicle leasing portfolio as more fully
described in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report.

Loans represented 66% of average interest-earning assets for 2004 compared with 65% for 2003. The term “loans” in this Report excludes loans held for sale and securities that represent interests in pools of loans.



Average securities totaled $15.9 billion in 2004 and $14.7 billion in 2003. Securities comprised 26% of average
interest-earning assets for 2004 compared with 27% for 2003. The increase in average securities in 2004 compared with the prior year was primarily due to increases in U.S. Treasury and government agencies/corporations securities, partially offset by
a decline in other debt securities.

Funding cost is affected by the volume and
type of funding sources that we have as well as the rates that we pay on those sources. Average total deposits were $49.7 billion for 2004 compared with $44.5 billion for 2003. The increase in average total deposits was attributable to increased
customer volumes and the acquisition of United National that added approximately $2.2 billion of average deposits. Average total deposits comprised 66% of total sources of funds for 2004 and 2003. Average transaction deposits were $35.9 billion for
2004 and $33.0 billion for 2003.

Average borrowed funds increased to $12.5
billion for 2004 compared with $10.5 billion for 2003. The following contributed to this increase:

•

The addition to our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $1.2 billion of junior subordinated debentures ($300 million of which was issued in December 2003) at December 31, 2003, the
effective date that we deconsolidated our trust preferred securities under FIN 46,

•

The comparative impact of the addition of commercial paper related to Market Street resulting from the adoption of FIN 46 in the second half of 2003,

•

Our issuance of $600 million of subordinated notes in November 2003 and $500 million of subordinated notes in December 2004, and

•

An increase in short-term borrowings to fund asset growth.

These increases in average borrowed funds were partially offset by Federal Home Loan Bank maturities of $1.3 billion and senior and subordinated debt maturities totaling
$1.1 billion during 2004.

We refer you to Item 1 of this Report for an overview of our business segments. Total business
segment earnings were $1.266 billion for 2004 and $1.176 billion for 2003.

Regional Community Banking

Regional Community Banking’s earnings were $504 million for 2004 and $477 million for 2003. Checking
relationships as of December 31, 2004 grew 8% compared with December 31, 2003, while Regional Community Banking average loans grew 30% and average demand deposits grew 14% in 2004 compared with 2003. Earnings growth for 2004 reflected increased loan
demand and focused efforts to increase and retain the customer base. The impact of these factors on results for 2004 was partially offset by higher noninterest expense and a higher provision for credit losses.

Wholesale Banking

Earnings from Wholesale Banking were $443 million for 2004 and $391 million for 2003. The benefit of a $116 million decline in the provision for credit losses, reflecting overall improved asset quality, and an
increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income resulting from higher average loan and deposit balances drove the improvement in 2004. These factors were partially offset by higher staff expense to support business growth initiatives and lower
net gains on institutional loans held for sale.

PNC Advisors

PNC Advisors earned $106 million in 2004 and $89 million in 2003. The increased earnings reflected a pretax gain of $10 million, or $7 million after-tax,
from the sale of certain Hawthorn investment consulting activities, comparatively stronger equity markets, increased loan and deposit balances and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by the loss of earnings from the sold Hawthorn activities.

BlackRock

BlackRock reported earnings of $143 million for 2004 compared with $155 million for 2003. The decreased earnings in 2004 reflected a 20% increase in advisory fees driven by a growing base of assets under management as
well as a total of $18 million in tax benefits recorded in the first and fourth quarters of 2004, more than offset by $66 million of after-tax LTIP-related charges. See the 2002 BlackRock Long-term Retention and Incentive Plan section of Item 7 of
this Report for additional information regarding the LTIP charges. BlackRock’s assets under management totaled $342 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of 10% compared with the prior year-end level. The increase was attributable to net
new subscriptions and market appreciation.

PNC owns approximately 71% of
BlackRock and we consolidate BlackRock into our financial statements. Accordingly, approximately 29% of BlackRock’s earnings is recognized as minority interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. BlackRock financial information in
Item 7 of this Report is presented on a stand-alone basis. The market value of our BlackRock shares was approximately $3.5 billion at December 31, 2004, while the book value at that date was $.6 billion.

PFPC

PFPC earned $70 million for 2004 and $64 million for 2003. The higher earnings were primarily attributable to increased fund servicing revenues, the divestiture of the retirement services business and the acquisition
of ADVISORport, Inc., both executed in 2003. Improved results for 2004 also reflected net new and expanded business, expense savings initiatives and debt management.

PFPC’s accounting/administration net fund assets increased 10% and custody fund assets increased 12% as of December 31, 2004 compared
with the balances at December 31, 2003. The increases were driven by improved equity market conditions, net new business and asset inflows from existing clients.

Other

The “Other” net loss
for 2004 was $27 million compared with a net loss of $100 million in 2003. Equity management gains in 2004 and the comparative effect of $87 million of after-tax charges related to the DOJ agreement reflected in the 2003 amounts more than offset the
impact of lower net securities gains in 2004. The decline in “Other” revenue for 2004 compared with the prior year was primarily due to a decline in net interest income from asset and liability management activities and the impact of the
second quarter 2004 sale of our vehicle leasing business.

The interest income
earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. In order to provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins
for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets has been increased to make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments.

The net interest margin was 3.22% for 2004, a decline of 42 basis points compared with 2003. The
following factors contributed to the decline in net interest margin in 2004:

•

The low interest rate environment that persisted through 2004 resulted in the average yield on loans declining by 47 basis points for 2004 compared with 2003. The decline in loan
yields was attributable to the level of interest rates, the repricing mix of our loan portfolio, competitive pricing pressure on commercial loans, more aggressive pricing on home equity loans and the sale of the vehicle leasing portfolio.

•

While the average yield on loans declined 47 basis points as described above, the average rate paid on deposits declined only seven basis points in 2004 compared with the prior
year. The average rate paid on money market accounts, the largest single component of interest-bearing deposits, increased 13 basis points, reflecting the increase in short-term interest rates that began in mid-2004. The increase in the average rate
paid on money market accounts was more than offset by declines in average rates paid on other interest-bearing deposits, resulting in the net decline of seven basis points in the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits during 2004.

•

To the extent that securities were sold, prepaid or matured and were replaced, the average yield on our securities portfolio declined. This decline totaled 36 basis points for 2004
compared with 2003.

•

See Note 18 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding the impact of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. (“SFAS”) 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,” and FIN 46 on the accounting for these instruments and the related impact on interest
expense during 2003 and 2004. Consolidated net interest margin was negatively impacted by 13 basis points in 2004 and five basis points for 2003 resulting from the accounting for these instruments.

The impact of the United National acquisition on 2004 taxable-equivalent net interest income
and net interest margin partially offset the factors described above. United National added approximately $123 million of net interest income and eight basis points to the net interest margin during 2004.

The provision for
credit losses was $52 million for 2004 compared with $177 million for 2003. The significant decline in the provision for credit losses compared with the prior year was primarily due to the overall improvement in the credit quality of the loan
portfolio during 2004. This improved credit quality reflected a 46% decline in nonperforming loans since December 31, 2003 and a reduction in problems related to performing credits. The favorable impact of these factors on the provision was
partially offset by the impact of overall loan growth in 2004. We expect the provision for credit losses to be higher in 2005 as a result of anticipated loan growth.

NCOME

Summary

Noninterest income totaled $3.563 billion for 2004
compared with $3.257 billion for 2003, an increase of $306 million, or 9%.



Higher noninterest income in 2004 reflected the following:

•

An increase of $188 million, or 12%, in asset management and fund servicing fees combined,

•

Equity management gains of $67 million in 2004 compared with equity management losses of $25 million in the prior year,

•

Pretax gains totaling $57 million from three sale transactions that occurred during the first half of 2004 as described in the analysis of other noninterest income below, and

•

The impact of the addition of United National’s business, which contributed approximately $21 million of noninterest income during 2004.

Lower net securities gains, lower trading revenue included in other noninterest income and
lower gains from loan sales partially offset the impact of these positive factors in the comparison with 2003.

Additional Analysis

Combined asset management and fund servicing fees totaled $1.811 billion for 2004, an
increase of $188 million compared with 2003. This increase reflected growth in assets managed and serviced, partially due to improved equity market conditions that began in 2003 and continued into 2004.

Consolidated assets under management were $383 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of
$29 billion from December 31, 2003, primarily due to growth in assets managed by BlackRock. PFPC provided fund accounting/administration services for $721 billion of net fund investment assets at December 31, 2004 compared with $654 billion at
December 31, 2003. PFPC also provided custody services for $451 billion of fund investment assets at December 31, 2004, an increase of $50 billion from the prior year-end. Net new business, comparatively improved equity market conditions and asset
inflows from existing clients all contributed to the increases in the PFPC statistics.

Service charges on deposits totaled $252 million for 2004, an increase of $13 million or 5% compared with 2003. Additional checking relationships, which increased 8% as of December 31, 2004, drove the improvement in this area.

Brokerage fees totaled $219 million for 2004 and $184 million for 2003. The 19% increase
compared with 2003 reflected higher non-trade, fee-based brokerage revenue.

Consumer services fees grew 5% in 2004, to $264 million, compared with the prior year. Higher fees for 2004 were partially due to additional fees from debit card transactions that reflected higher volumes, including the impact of United
National customers, partially offset by the impact of the sale of certain out-of-footprint ATMs.

Visa settled litigation in 2003 with major retailers regarding pricing and usage of customer debit cards. The settlement effectively lowered prices paid by merchants to Visa and its member banks beginning August 1,
2003. Although PNC was not a defendant in the litigation, the settlement lowered future revenue from certain debit card transactions. The lost revenue impact to PNC in 2004 was approximately $10 million and for 2003 was approximately $6 million.

Corporate services revenue was $473 million for 2004, a decline of $12 million
or 2% compared with 2003. Net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to our liquidation of institutional loans held for sale are reflected in this line item and totaled $52 million for 2004 compared with $69 million for 2003. As the
liquidation of institutional loans held for sale is essentially complete, any additional gains in 2005 will be minimal. Higher fees related to an increase in commercial mortgage servicing activities and higher letters of credit fees partially offset
the decline in net gains on institutional loans held for sale compared with the prior year.

Equity management (private equity activities) net gains on portfolio investments totaled $67 million for 2004 compared with net losses of $25 million for 2003. See Private Equity Asset Valuation in the Critical
Accounting Policies And Judgments section and Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk in the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report for further information.

Net securities gains were $55 million in 2004 compared with $116 million in 2003. Net
securities gains for 2003 included $25 million related to the liquidation that year of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions.

Other noninterest income totaled $422 million for 2004, an increase of $38 million or 10% compared with 2003. Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from year to
year depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. Other noninterest income for 2004 included the following:

•

A $34 million pretax gain related to the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts as described under DIG B36 Impact on 2003 Results and 2004 Sale of Modified Coinsurance Contracts
below,

•

A $13 million pretax gain recognized during the second quarter of 2004 in connection with BlackRock’s sale of its interest in Trepp LLC, and

•

A $10 million pretax gain related to the first quarter 2004 sale of certain investment consulting activities of the Hawthorn unit of PNC Advisors.

In addition to these items, the increase in other noninterest income for 2004 compared with
the prior year included the recognition of $25 million of private equity dividends in 2004 and the comparative impact of $12 million related to the mid-2003 adoption of FIN 46.

Partially offsetting the impact of these items on other noninterest income was a $7 million decline in leasing revenue resulting from the
2004 sale of our vehicle leasing business and a $14 million decline in the component of trading revenue included in other noninterest income for 2004 compared with the prior year. See Trading Risk within the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this
Report and Note 8 Trading Activities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

Wholesale Banking offers treasury management, capital markets, commercial loan
servicing and equipment leasing products that are marketed by several businesses across PNC.

Treasury management revenue, which includes fees as well as revenue from customer deposit balances, totaled $373 million for 2004 compared with $360 million 2003. Treasury management revenue has increased due to the
longer-term nature of treasury management deposits and increased product sales, partially offset by the industry shift toward electronic payment service, which has lower revenue per item than check payment service.

Consolidated revenue from capital markets totaled $140 million for 2004 and $119 million for
2003. The revenue growth was driven primarily by increased client-related trading revenue and increased loan syndication fees.

Midland Loan Services offers servicing and technology solutions for the commercial real estate finance industry. Midland’s revenue, which includes fees as well as
revenue from servicing deposit balances, totaled $108 million in 2004 compared with $96 million for 2003. The revenue growth was driven primarily by growth in the servicing portfolio and related services.

Consolidated revenue from equipment leasing products totaled $84 million for both 2004 and
2003. We changed our product mix during 2004 as we no longer engage in higher spread, cross-border leases but have shifted to more traditional leasing products.

As a component of our advisory services to clients, we provide a select set of insurance products to fulfill specific customer financial needs. Primary insurance
offerings include:

•

Annuities,

•

Credit life,

•

Health,

•

Disability, and

•

Commercial lines coverage.

Client segments served by these insurance solutions include those in PNC Advisors, Regional Community Banking and Wholesale Banking. Insurance products are sold by PNC-licensed insurance agents and through licensed
third-party arrangements. We recognized revenue of $65 million in 2004 and $54 million in 2003. The increase in revenue compared with the prior year reflects the recognition of 100% of annuity sales commissions that began in 2004 following the sale
of our annuity reinsurance contracts.

Additionally, through our subsidiary
companies, PNC Insurance Corp. and Alpine Indemnity Limited, we act as a reinsurer for credit life and accident and health insurance provided to customers of our subsidiaries. We also write, assume and cede insurance for property, workers’
compensation, commercial general liability and automobile liability of PNC and its affiliates.

In the normal course of business PNC Insurance Corp. and Alpine Indemnity Limited maintain insurance reserves for reported claims and for claims incurred but not reported based on actuarial assessments.

Total noninterest expense was $3.735 billion for 2004, an increase of $259 million or 7% compared with $3.476 billion in 2003. The efficiency ratio was 68% for 2004 and
66% for 2003.

Noninterest expense for 2004 included the following:

•

Pretax charges totaling $110 million, including $96 million recorded in the third quarter, associated with the BlackRock LTIP. Total LTIP charges were comprised of $102 million of
compensation expense, $2 million of employee benefits and $6 million of “Other” noninterest expense;

•

Costs totaling approximately $78 million resulting from our first quarter 2004 acquisition of United National, including approximately $11 million of conversion-related and other
nonrecurring costs. The impact of these costs was reflected in several noninterest expense line items in our Consolidated Statement of Income and was included almost entirely in the Regional Community Banking business segment;

•

A $22 million reduction in the benefit of accretion related to a discounted PFPC client contract liability that ended during the second quarter of 2004;



•

The fourth quarter 2004 benefit of $9 million resulting from the settlement of certain claims related to the 2001 PAGIC transactions;

•

Expenses totaling $8 million in connection with the sale of our vehicle leasing business during the second quarter of 2004; and

•

A $6 million impairment charge on an intangible asset related to the orderly liquidation of a particular fund managed by BlackRock. We recognized this charge during the first
quarter of 2004.

In addition to these items, the increase in
noninterest expense for 2004 compared with the prior year included the impact of the following items, which had no effect on 2004 consolidated net income:

•

An increase of $30 million related to the mid-2003 adoption of FIN 46, and

•

An increase of $22 million in PFPC out-of-pocket and pass-through expenses which are offset in noninterest income.

Noninterest expense for 2003 included the impact of the following items:

•

Expenses totaling $120 million recognized in connection with a subsidiary’s second quarter 2003 agreement with the DOJ, including $5 million of related legal and consulting
costs;

•

Costs totaling $29 million paid in connection with our 2003 liquidation of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions. The impact of these costs was mostly offset
by related net securities gains included in noninterest income;

•

Distributions on capital securities totaling $28 million;

•

Facilities charges totaling $25 million related to leased space consistent with the requirements of SFAS 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities;” and

•

A $25 million benefit from the vehicle leasing settlement during the fourth quarter of 2003, as described in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Report.

Apart from the items described above, noninterest expense for
2004 increased $169 million compared with 2003. Higher expenses in 2004 were primarily attributable to higher sales-based compensation, stock-based incentive compensation and marketing costs. These charges more than offset the benefit of lower
pension expense in the comparison and an $87 million incremental benefit in 2004 from efficiency initiatives.

We expect that the cost of our executive risk insurance will decrease in 2005 relative to the current level. We expensed approximately $28 million related to this insurance in 2004 and expect 2005 expense to total
approximately $20 million.

Executive risk insurance includes the following
types of coverage:

•

Financial institution bond,

•

Directors and officers liability,

•

Professional and fiduciary liability, and

•

Employment practices liability.

We expect to recognize a benefit to earnings from our pension plan activity in 2005 compared with expense in 2004. See the Status of Defined Benefit Pension Plan section

A reduced state and local tax expense due to tax benefits of $18 million recorded in connection with New York state and city audits, principally associated with BlackRock,

•

A $14 million reduction in income tax expense following our determination in the third quarter of 2004 that we no longer required an income tax reserve related to bank-owned life

The summarized balance sheet data
above is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Item 8 of this Report.

The $11.6 billion increase in total assets at December 31, 2004 compared with December 31, 2003 was primarily driven by the following:

•

The impact of our January 2004 acquisition of United National,

•

Organic growth in total loans,

•

Increases in other assets, other short-term investments and goodwill, and

•

A larger securities portfolio.

NCOME

Loans increased $7.2 billion, or 20%, as of December 31, 2004 compared with December 31, 2003. The increase in total loans reflected the following:

•

Home equity loans increased $2.9 billion, reflecting organic growth and the purchase of approximately $660 million of home equity loans in early 2004,

•

Demand for commercial loans grew during the year, reflected in the $2.4 billion increase in this loan category, and

•

Automobile and other consumer loans combined increased $.8 billion.

The favorable impact of these factors on our loan balances was partially offset by the effect of the sale of the vehicle leasing portfolio in 2004. We added $1.9 billion
of loans with the United National acquisition in 2004, as reflected in various loan categories.

Details Of Loans

As the table above indicates, the
loans that we hold continued to be diversified among numerous industries and types of businesses. The loans that we hold are also diversified across the geographic areas where we do business.

As shown in the table below, the types of commercial loans and unfunded commitments in our
Wholesale Banking business remained concentrated in investment grade equivalent exposure and secured lending.

Cross-border Leases and Related Tax Matters

The equipment
lease portfolio totaled $3.9 billion at December 31, 2004 and included approximately $1.7 billion of cross-border leases. Cross-border leases are primarily leveraged leases of equipment located in foreign countries, primarily in western Europe and
Australia. We no longer enter into new cross-border lease transactions.



Aggregate residual value at risk on the total commercial lease portfolio at December 31, 2004 was $1.1 billion. We have
taken steps to mitigate $.7 billion of this residual risk, including residual value insurance coverage with third parties, third party guarantees, and other actions. Approximately $.4 billion of this risk was unmitigated at December 31, 2004.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA”) limits the tax
deductions that may be taken in a given year related to certain lease transactions, including the types of cross-border lease transactions that we have previously entered into. However, AJCA impacts only cross-border lease transactions entered into
after March 12, 2004. All of our cross-border lease transactions were entered into prior to this date and are therefore not affected by AJCA. While only transactions entered into after March 12, 2004 are specifically impacted, AJCA is clear that no
inference should be drawn as to the proper tax treatment of transactions entered into on or before this date. Thus, the tax treatment of existing transactions is still subject to challenge by the IRS.

As part of the audit of our 1998-2000 consolidated federal income tax returns, the IRS has
proposed adjustments to the following cross-border lease transactions that we have previously entered into:

•

Two lease-in, lease-out transactions,

•

Seven qualified technological equipment leases, and

•

Three lease-to-service contract transactions.

The proposed adjustments would reverse the tax treatment of these transactions as we reported them on our filed tax returns. We believe the method used to report these
transactions in our filed tax returns is supported by appropriate tax law and intend to pursue resolution of the matter through the appropriate IRS administrative appeal remedies. While we cannot predict with certainty the result of pursuing the
administrative appeal remedies, any resolution would most likely involve a change in the timing of tax deductions which in turn, depending on the exact resolution, could significantly impact the economics of these transactions. However, we believe
our reserves for this exposure were adequate at December 31, 2004.

Further,
the FASB has begun to consider whether any change in the timing of tax benefits associated with these transactions should result in a recalculation under SFAS 13, “Accounting for Leases,” and whether a lessor should re-evaluate the
classification of a leveraged lease when a recalculation of the lease is performed. In March 2005, the FASB directed its staff to issue a proposed staff position on this issue. If the FASB ultimately decides companies must recalculate and
re-evaluate leveraged lease classification, the impact on us could be material. For example, a cumulative adjustment to earnings could be required and the leases may no longer qualify as leveraged leases. Since the FASB has not finalized any
guidance and we have not reached any settlement with the IRS, we cannot currently estimate the potential impact.

Even though we intend to pursue resolution with the IRS through administrative appeal remedies, it is possible we will be unable to reach a settlement. If we are unable
to reach settlement, we will evaluate other options, including litigation. There is, of course, no guarantee as to the outcome of litigation.

In addition to the transactions described above, two lease-to-service contract transactions that we were party to were structured as partnerships for tax purposes. We
have been informed that the partnerships are under audit by the IRS. However, we do not believe that our exposure from these transactions is material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

The IRS is also beginning an audit of our 2001-2003 consolidated federal income tax returns.
We expect them to again propose adjustments to the cross-border lease transactions described above as well as to new cross-border lease transactions entered in these years.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recognized the benefit of a $25 million settlement related to our vehicle leasing business. We reached this settlement with
insurance carriers regarding certain residual value claims for which a reserve had been provided in 2001.

During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the sale of our subsidiary, PNC Vehicle Leasing LLC, and the related vehicle lease portfolio and other assets. In connection with this transaction, we also terminated
our related residual insurance policies with our remaining residual insurance carrier. As a result of these actions, we have completed the exit of the consumer vehicle leasing business, including our related exposures to the used vehicle market and
the payment of future residual insurance claims. We recognized a pretax net loss of $3 million related to this sale during the second quarter of 2004.

On September 1, 2004, we acquired the business of the Aviation Finance Group, LLC (“AFG”), an Idaho-based company that specializes in loans to finance private
aircraft. Historically, AFG has originated a diversified loan portfolio with average individual loan balances of approximately $2 million and a loan-to-value ratio below 70%. AFG’s loan volume has exceeded $150 million annually over the past
few years. By combining the business of AFG with our existing business, we expect to increase our ability to offer a variety of loans and leasing products to corporate aircraft customers. See Note 3 Acquisitions in the Notes To Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.



Net Unfunded Credit Commitments

Commitments to extend credit represent
arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. Commercial commitments are reported net of participations, assignments and syndications, primarily to financial institutions, totaling $6.7 billion at
December 31, 2004 and $6.4 billion at December 31, 2003.

The increase in
consumer net unfunded commitments at December 31, 2004 compared with the balance at December 31, 2003 was primarily due to net unfunded commitments related to organic growth, our first quarter 2004 purchase of a portfolio of home equity loans and
the acquisition of United National.

Unfunded credit commitments related to
Market Street totaled $962 million at December 31, 2004 and $911 million at December 31, 2003 and are included in the preceding table primarily within the “Commercial” and “Consumer” categories. See the Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements And Consolidated VIEs section of Item 7 and Note 2 Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further information regarding Market Street.

In addition to credit commitments, our net outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $3.7
billion at December 31, 2004 and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2003. Standby letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of our customers if specified future events occur.

Securities

Details Of Securities

Securities represented 21% of total
assets at December 31, 2004 compared with 23% at December 31, 2003. The increase in total securities compared with December 31, 2003 was primarily due to increases in U.S. Treasury and government agencies and mortgage-backed securities, partially
offset by declines in commercial mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities.

At December 31, 2004, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of $102 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2003 was a net
unrealized gain of $4 million. The impact on bond prices of increases in interest rates during 2004 was reflected in the net unrealized loss position at December 31, 2004.



The fair value of securities available for sale decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. Further increases
in interest rates after December 31, 2004, if sustained, will adversely impact the fair value of securities available for sale in 2005 compared with the balance at year end. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale
portfolio are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax.

The expected weighted-average life of securities available for sale was 2 years and 8 months at December 31, 2004 compared with 2 years and 11 months at December 31, 2003. We estimate the effective duration of securities available for sale
is 2.7 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.3 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates.

Education loans held for sale totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2004 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and represented the majority of our loans held for sale at
each date. We classify substantially all of our education loans as loans held for sale. Generally, we sell education loans when the loans are placed into repayment status. Gains on sales of education loans totaled $30 million for 2004, $20 million
for 2003 and $23 million for 2002. These gains are reflected in the “Other” noninterest income line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income and in the results of the Regional Community Banking segment.

Loans held for sale remaining from our 2001 institutional lending repositioning totaled $5
million at December 31, 2004 and $70 million at December 31, 2003. Our liquidation of institutional loans held for sale resulted in net gains in excess of valuation adjustments of $52 million in 2004, $69 million in 2003 and $147 million in 2002.
These gains are reflected in the Corporate Services line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income and in the results of the Wholesale Banking business segment. As the liquidation of institutional loans held for sale is essentially complete, any
additional gains in 2005 will be minimal.

OURCES

Details Of Funding Sources

(a)

Attributable to Market Street.

Total funding sources increased $8.5 billion, or 15%, from December 31, 2003. This increase reflected the impact of the following 2004 developments:

•

Our United National acquisition,

•

An 8% increase in checking relationships,

•

An increase in time deposits in foreign offices that reflected our increased use of eurodollar deposits as a short-term funding mechanism,

•

The issuance of $500 million of 18 month, floating rate bank notes in September 2004 and $500 million of 5.25% subordinated bank notes due 2017 in December 2004, and

•

An increase in other short-term borrowings to fund asset growth.

These increases were partially offset by debt maturities of $2.4 billion during 2004.



Capital

We
manage our capital position by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt and equity instruments, making treasury stock transactions, maintaining dividend policies and retaining earnings.

The increase of $.8 billion, to $7.5 billion, in total shareholders’ equity at December
31, 2004 compared with the prior year-end was primarily attributable to $360 million of common stock issued as part of the January 2004 United National acquisition and a higher retention of earnings through 2004 in anticipation of the SSRM
acquisition by BlackRock and the pending acquisition of Riggs. Partially offsetting this increase was a decline in the fair value of securities available for sale and cash flow hedge derivatives due to the impact of rising interest rates that began
during the second quarter of 2004 and continued into the latter half of the year. These fair value changes are captured in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholders’ equity. See Note 26 Comprehensive Income in
the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

Common shares outstanding at December 31, 2004 were 282.6 million, an increase of 6 million over December 31, 2003, principally due to the issuance of common shares for the acquisition of United National.

In January 2002, the Board of Directors authorized us to purchase up to 35 million shares
of our common stock through February 29, 2004. Under this program, we purchased 10.8 million common shares during 2003 at a total cost of $507.8 million and .7 million shares at a total cost of $41.5 million during 2004.

In February 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 20 million shares
of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The 2004 repurchase authorization was a replacement and continuation of the prior repurchase program. Under this program, we purchased 3.0 million common shares during 2004 at
a total cost of $165.6 million.

As of February 16, 2005, the 2004 program was
terminated, and a new program to purchase up to 20 million shares was authorized. This program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. The extent and timing of share repurchases under the 2005 program
will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, and the potential impact on our credit rating. The pending acquisition
of Riggs and BlackRock’s acquisition of SSRM will cause us to constrain share purchases over the next several quarters as we seek to maintain our capital position.

Risk-Based Capital

(a)

See Note 18 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding the deconsolidation of trust preferred
securities at December 31, 2003 under GAAP. However, these securities remained a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 based upon guidance from the Federal Reserve.

(b)

The federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule amending their risk-based capital standards regarding the capital treatment for certain asset-backed commercial paper
programs. This final rule ended the regulatory capital relief previously granted through July 1, 2004 with respect to the Market Street conduit. The impact on our risk-based capital ratios with respect to the Market Street conduit is minimal at
December 31, 2004 but the ratios may decrease slightly after the transition period ends September 30, 2005.

The access to, and cost of, funding new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends,
the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on a financial institution’s capital strength. The declines in the capital ratios at December 31, 2004 compared with the ratios at December
31, 2003 reflected the growth in our Consolidated Balance Sheet during 2004.

At December 31, 2004, each of our banking subsidiaries was considered “well capitalized” based on regulatory capital ratio requirements. See the Supervision And Regulation section of Item 1 of this Report and Note 4 Regulatory
Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. We believe our bank subsidiaries will continue to meet these requirements in 2005.

We engage in a variety of activities that involve
unconsolidated entities or that are otherwise not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as “off-balance sheet arrangements.” The following sections of this Report provide further information on these
types of activities:

•

Commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report, and

•

Note 28 Commitments and Guarantees included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

The following provides a summary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”), including
those that we have consolidated into our financial statements and those that remained unconsolidated as of December 31, 2004.

At December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the aggregate assets and debt of VIEs that we have consolidated in our financial statements are as follows:

Consolidated VIEs – PNC Is Primary Beneficiary

•

Market Street is a multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduit that is independently owned and managed. The activities of Market Street are limited to the purchase of, or
making of, loans secured by interests primarily in pools of receivables from U.S. corporations that desire access to the commercial paper market. Market Street funds the purchase or making of loans by issuing commercial paper. Market Street’s
commercial paper has been rated A1/P1 by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. We hold no ownership interest in Market Street, but are considered to be the primary beneficiary. All of Market Street’s assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003
collateralize the commercial paper obligations. These assets are primarily classified as loans on our consolidated balance sheet. Neither creditors nor equity investors in Market Street have any recourse to the general credit of PNC. Market Street
results are reflected in our Wholesale Banking segment.

•

Certain equity investments are made by us in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit pursuant to Section 42
of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings and to assist PNC in achieving goals associated with the
Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are
funded through a combination of debt and equity, with equity typically comprising 30% to 60% of the total project capital. We own a majority of the limited partnership interests in these entities. We also consolidated certain entities in which we,
as a national syndicator of affordable housing equity, serves as the general partner (together with the aforementioned limited partnership investments, the “LIHTC investments”), and no other entity owns a majority of the limited
partnership interests. In these syndication transactions, we create funds in which our subsidiary is the general partner and sells limited partnership interests to third parties, and in some cases may also purchase a limited partnership interest in
the fund. The fund’s limited partners can generally remove the general partner without cause at any time. The purpose of this business is to generate income from the syndication of these funds and to generate servicing fees from the management
of the funds. General partner activities include selecting, evaluating, structuring, negotiating, and closing the fund’s investments in operating limited partnerships, as well as oversight of the ongoing operations of the fund portfolio. The
assets are primarily included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Neither creditors nor equity investors in the LIHTC investments have any recourse to the general credit of PNC. The LIHTC investments are reflected in our Wholesale
Banking segment.



We also hold significant variable interests in other VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered
the primary beneficiary. Information on these VIEs follows:

Non-Consolidated VIEs – Significant Variable Interests

(a)

Held by BlackRock.

(b)

Management of the funds was transferred as part of the sale of certain investment consulting activities of PNC Advisors’ Hawthorn unit during first quarter 2004.

•

BlackRock is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that may be deemed to be VIEs and may hold interests therein, including investment advisory agreements
and equity securities, which may be considered variable interests. BlackRock engages in these transactions principally to address client needs through the launch of collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) and private investment funds.
BlackRock has not been deemed the primary beneficiary of these entities.

•

We have a significant variable interest in certain other limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects. We do not own a majority of the limited partnership interests
in these entities and are not the primary beneficiary. We use the equity method to account for our investment in these entities.

We also have subsidiaries that invest in and act as the investment manager for a private equity fund that is organized as a limited partnership as part of our equity
management activity. The fund invests in private equity investments to generate capital appreciation and profits. As permitted by FIN 46, we have deferred applying the provisions of the interpretation for this entity pending further action by the
FASB. Information on this entity follows:

We operate five major businesses engaged in providing banking, asset management and global
fund processing products and services. Banking businesses include regional community banking, wholesale banking and wealth management.

Our treasury management activities, which include cash and investment management, receivables management, disbursement services and global trade services; capital markets
products, which include foreign exchange, derivatives and loan syndications; and equipment leasing products are offered through Wholesale Banking and marketed by several businesses across PNC.

Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices
and our operating structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”); therefore, the financial results of individual businesses are
not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We refine our methodologies from time to time as our management accounting practices are enhanced and our businesses change. Financial results are presented, to the extent
practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis.

We changed
our financial reporting for our business segments beginning with first quarter 2004 reporting and restated all prior period amounts to conform with the new methodology. The principal changes to our segment reporting are as follows:

•

We replaced the assignment of securities or funds to balance net assets for each business segment with a funds transfer pricing methodology.

•

We removed the impact of our asset and liability management function from the business segments. This is now reflected in the results of “Other.”

•

The Wholesale Banking business segment captures the results that were previously reported separately as Corporate Banking, PNC Real Estate Finance and PNC Business Credit to more
accurately reflect the integrated operating strategy of this business.

•

We have implemented a new capital measurement methodology based on the concept of economic capital for Regional Community Banking, Wholesale Banking, PNC Advisors and PFPC. However,
we increased the capital assigned to Regional Community Banking to 6% of funds to reflect the capital required for well-capitalized banks and to approximate market comparables for this business. The capital for BlackRock reflects legal entity
shareholders’ equity consistent with BlackRock’s separate public financial statement disclosures.

We have allocated the allowance for loan and lease losses based on our assessment of risk inherent in the loan portfolios. Our allocation of the costs incurred by
operations and other support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services.

Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated results. The impact of these differences is primarily reflected in minority interest in income of
BlackRock and in the “Other” category in the Results of Business – Summary table that follows. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as
asset and liability management activities, related net securities gains, equity management activities, differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), corporate overhead and intercompany
eliminations. Business segment results, including inter-segment revenues, are included in Note 25 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

“Other Information” included in the tables that follow is presented as of period
end, except for the following which represent amounts for the periods presented: net charge-offs and the related annualized net charge-off percentage; home equity portfolio credit statistics; gains on sales of education loans; average small business
deposits; consolidated revenue from treasury management, capital markets and Midland Loan Services; and average full-time equivalent employees (“FTEs”). FTE statistics as reported by business reflect staff directly employed by the
respective businesses and exclude corporate and shared services employees. Prior period FTE amounts generally are not restated for organizational changes.



Results Of Businesses – Summary

(a)

Business revenue is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis except for BlackRock and PFPC. BlackRock in 2003 and PFPC for both years are presented on a book (GAAP) basis. The
interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and
margins for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets has been increased to make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments. A reconciliation of total consolidated revenue on a book basis to total
consolidated revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis is as follows (in millions):

(b)

During the first quarter of 2004, management changed its policy for recognizing charge-offs on smaller nonperforming commercial loans. This change resulted in the recognition of an
additional $24 million of gross charge-offs for the first quarter of 2004. For the remaining nine months of 2004, this portion of the portfolio experienced a reduction in gross charge-offs and an increase in recoveries from expected levels. The
impact of this change in future periods is not expected to be significant.

(c)

Included in other noninterest income.

Regional Community Banking earnings increased $27 million in 2004 compared with 2003. Growth in customer relationships, loans and deposits combined with the United
National acquisition produced a 10% increase in revenues. The revenue increase was partially offset by a 10% increase in noninterest expenses and a 55% increase in the segment’s provision for credit losses.

Performance highlights for Regional Community Banking for 2004 include:

•

A 14% increase in average demand deposit balances over 2003, which was driven by an 8% increase in consumer and small business checking account relationships. Approximately 60% of
this net growth in checking relationships was from new customers with the remainder attributable to the acquisition of United National.

•

Small business relationships grew by 13%, and drove growth in commercial loans and small business deposits. Approximately 60% of the growth in relationships resulted from
accelerated acquisition of new customers while the remaining increase was attributable to United National. This increase was driven by additional sales staff, including increased small business customer-calling efforts by branch managers.

•

Average loans for 2004 increased $4.1 billion or 30% over 2003 levels driven by strong consumer and small business loan demand. Approximately 38% of this dollar increase in loans
was attributable to United National.



•

A continuation of efforts to expand and optimize the configuration of the branch network. During the year, we opened six stand-alone and 13 in-store branches, and acquired 47
branches from United National. These additions to the branch network, partially offset by the consolidation and sale of certain branches, increased the network total to 774 branches.

•

The percentage of our consumers banking with us online continued to increase. As of December 2004, 45% of our consumer checking relationships were utilizing web-based banking
options compared with 41% a year earlier.

Taxable-equivalent net
interest income increased $137 million in 2004 primarily due to loan growth of 30% and deposit balance growth of 7%. The benefits of the loan and deposit growth were partially offset by a lower value assigned to deposits and additional carrying
costs related to goodwill associated with United National. All of the goodwill associated with the United National acquisition is reflected in the Regional Community Banking segment.

Noninterest income increased by $44 million over 2003 driven by the increase in checking relationships, higher income from payment-related
products such as debit card and merchant services, and higher gains on sales of education loans and the sale of two branches. These increases were partially offset by a decline in ATM surcharge revenue related to our strategic downsizing of
out-of-footprint ATMs. Investment revenues decreased $4 million due to a reduced customer demand for fixed annuity products. In 2004 we also introduced free checking for small business customers and free web bill pay for consumers, and increased
penetration of free checking for consumers – initiatives geared toward improving customer acquisition and retention but which negatively impacted fee income growth.

The 2004 provision for credit losses increased by $22 million over 2003. The larger provision was driven mainly by loan growth and
management’s decision earlier in 2004 to change the charge-off policy for commercial loans less than $250,000. Overall credit quality indicators are currently stable and have improved over 2003. Home equity FICO scores, loan to value ratios and
accounts 90 days past due improved. We update FICO scores for each account on a quarterly basis. While we are committed to lending within a moderate risk profile, further improvements in credit quality are not anticipated for 2005. Provisions for
credit losses are expected to increase commensurate with loan growth in the coming year.

Noninterest expenses in 2004 included $75 million of costs related to the acquisition of United National, including $11 million of conversion-related and other nonrecurring costs. Approximately $17 million in expense
growth can be attributed to the build-out of our branch network (in-store branches associated with the Stop & Shop initiative and standalone branch sites), expansion of the small business sales force, increased marketing and sales activities, as
well as higher technology expenditures related to investments in teller and back-office operations to increase productivity, improve service and strengthen risk management processes.

We have adopted a relationship-based lending strategy to target homeowners, small businesses and auto dealerships while seeking to maintain
a moderate risk profile in the loan portfolio.

•

Home equity loans grew by $2.5 billion or 30% on average for 2004 compared with the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to continued strength in loan demand, the
United National acquisition and the purchase of a $660 million portfolio in the first quarter of 2004. Home equity loans have experienced strong growth over the recent periods of low interest rates. We would expect future growth rates to moderate as
interest rates rise.

•

Average commercial loans grew 25% on the strength of increased loan demand from existing customers, the United National acquisition and an increase in the rate of small business
customer acquisition.

•

Floor plan and indirect loan portfolios grew 15% and 77% respectively over 2003 levels due to managed increases in our dealer portfolio through new relationships, the United
National acquisition and a renewed emphasis on indirect lending.

Residential mortgage loans increased $293 million due to the addition of a $518 million portfolio associated with the United National acquisition. The overall portfolio is decreasing as payoffs occur. This trend is expected to continue in
2005.

Growth in core deposits as a low cost source of funding is one of the
primary objectives of our checking relationship growth strategy. Average total deposits increased $2.4 billion or 7% on average in 2004 compared with the prior year. The deposit growth was driven by increases in the number of checking and savings
relationships and the United National acquisition.

•

Average consumer and small business demand deposits grew 14% over last year driven by the growth in our customer base and the acquisition of United National. For the year, the
growth rate in balances, particularly in the consumer segment, exceeded the growth rate in relationships, as customers were hesitant to move funds into perceived higher risk alternatives such as equities, bonds or long-term CDs during a period of
low interest rates and economic uncertainty. As such, we expect the future average demand deposit balance growth rate to be closer to the customer growth rate.

•

Customer integration and retention efforts for United National have been successful as evidenced by a stable customer base and deposit portfolio since the transaction was completed.

•

Checking relationship retention has improved and benefited from the increased penetration rates of debit card, online banking and online bill payment products and services.

•

Customer balances in other deposit products including savings, money market and certificates of deposit increased $712 million primarily due to the United National acquisition.
Fourth quarter average portfolios grew by $593 million compared with second quarter as the rise in interest rates began to attract funds back into certificates of deposits after an extended period of portfolio declines in a low interest rate
environment.

Includes nonperforming loans of $51 million at December 31, 2004 and $177 million at December 31, 2003.

Wholesale Banking earnings increased 13% in 2004, primarily due to the overall improved credit quality of the loan portfolio, which was
reflected in a $116 million decrease in the segment’s provision for credit losses.

Highlights of 2004 for Wholesale Banking include:

•

Total loans outstanding at December 31, 2004 increased $1.5 billion, or 9%, compared with December 31, 2003, driven by net new business and the acquisition of United National.

•

Average deposits increased 18% in 2004 compared with the prior year as further described below.

•

Client acquisition exceeded our expectations.

•

Asset quality remained strong and nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2004 declined 69% compared with December 31, 2003.

•

Capital markets revenue increased $21 million, or 18%, compared with 2003 driven by customer-related trading activity and loan syndication fees.

•

Revenue from Midland Loan Services grew $12 million, or 12%, compared with the prior year due to an 18% increase in the portfolio serviced.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2004 increased $17 million compared with 2003,
primarily due to loan and deposit growth. As economic expansion continues, we expect our customers to require additional lending facilities and to increase utilization of existing facilities. Although competition for high-quality customers has
increased, we believe we can continue to compete effectively through competitive pricing and the strength of our product offerings, such as treasury management and capital markets products and services. We are winning new clients both within our
primary geographic footprint and across the nation, and this expansion is being achieved within our prudent risk/return parameters. Our corporate banking and national secured lending businesses, business credit, leasing and real estate finance, have
benefited from improving economic conditions and improved sales efforts, resulting in significant loan growth.

The provision for credit losses was $5 million for 2004 compared with $121 million in 2003. The reduced provision was attributable to improved overall credit quality, as demonstrated by an $109 million reduction in
net charge-offs and a 69% reduction in nonperforming assets compared with 2003. While we intend to continue to initiate new business within our prudent risk/return parameters, we do not expect to continue to experience significant levels of
improvement in credit quality in 2005. In addition, we anticipate that our provision for credit losses will increase in 2005, driven by loan growth.

Noninterest income for 2004 decreased 5%, to $573 million compared with 2003. The decrease was attributable primarily to a $17 million reduction in net gains on
institutional loans held for sale compared with 2003 and $23 million of securities gains in 2003 related to the liquidation of two entities formed in 2001 in connection with the PAGIC transactions. These factors were partially offset by higher fees
from our commercial mortgage servicing, treasury management, and capital markets products.



Noninterest expense for 2004 increased 6%, to $671 million, compared with 2003. Noninterest expense in 2003 included a
$22 million impact related to the liquidation of two entities in connection with the PAGIC transactions and six months of noninterest expense related to the adoption of FIN 46, while noninterest expense for 2004 included a full year of expense
related to FIN 46. Apart from these items, noninterest expense increased $34 million in 2004 as a result of our ongoing effort to add revenue-producing employees.

Average deposits increased 18% in 2004 compared with 2003. This increase was primarily due to:

•

Successful sales of treasury management products,

•

Increased liquidity among our customers, and

•

An increased commercial mortgage servicing portfolio, which grew 18% from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004.

We provide additional discussion regarding product revenue from our treasury management,
capital markets, Midland Loan Services and equipment leasing businesses on page 20.

Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2004 declined $156 million, or 69%, compared with December 31, 2003 due to overall improvements in credit quality, continued liquidation of the institutional loans held for sale portfolio and the
resolution of the two largest nonperforming assets in PNC Business Credit. With the increase in the loan portfolio and the near-completion of the liquidation of institutional loans held for sale, we do not expect this decline in nonperforming assets
to continue.

Higher 2004 earnings at PNC Advisors reflected the impact of comparatively stronger equity markets, increased loan and deposit balances and lower expenses compared with
2003, in addition to the impact of a $7 million after-tax gain recognized in the first quarter of 2004 from the sale of certain investment consulting activities of the Hawthorn unit.

Highlights of 2004 for PNC Advisors include:

•

Personal and institutional investment management and trust sales increased compared with the comparable reporting period of 2003.

•

The fourth quarter of 2004 reflected a reversal in the decline of Hilliard Lyons retail trading volumes that began in the second quarter of 2004.

•

Average consumer loans increased 15% in 2004 compared with the prior year primarily due to home equity loan and line of credit volume.

•

Average deposits increased 6% in 2004 compared with 2003.

•

The sale of certain investment consulting activities of Hawthorn was completed in the first quarter of 2004. The sale resulted in a $10 million pretax gain and reduced assets under
management by approximately $5.9 billion.

Excluding the effect
of the Hawthorn transaction, assets under management at December 31, 2004 increased approximately $3 billion compared with the balance at December 31, 2003. The effect of comparatively higher equity markets and the acquisition of United National
more than offset net client asset outflows in 2004 apart from the Hawthorn transaction. Net client asset outflows are the result of ordinary distributions from trust and investment management accounts and account closures exceeding investment
additions from new and existing clients.

Net interest income increased $4
million in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to higher average deposits.

Investment management and trust revenue increased $3 million in 2004 compared with 2003 despite the loss of $8 million in fees due to the sale of certain investment consulting activities of the Hawthorn unit. The favorable increase was due
primarily to the comparatively higher equity markets. Brokerage revenue in 2004 increased $10 million compared with 2003 primarily due to increased fees. Excluding the effect of the Hawthorn transaction, other income declined $13 million through
year-end 2004 compared with the prior period primarily due to lower client-related trading.

Provision for credit losses declined $4 million in 2004 compared with the prior year primarily due to improvement in loan quality and lower net charge-offs.

Noninterest expense was down $9 million in 2004 compared with 2003, including a $7 million
expense savings related to the Hawthorn transaction. In 2003, PNC Advisors incurred a $5 million charge related to certain employment contracts. Excluding the impact of these items, noninterest expense was essentially flat compared with 2003.

Calculated as operating income, adjusted for BlackRock LTIP charges and appreciation on Rabbi trust assets related to BlackRock’s deferred compensation plans, divided by total
revenue less fund administration and servicing costs. The following is a reconciliation of this presentation to operating margin calculated on a GAAP basis (operating income divided by total revenue) in millions:

We believe that
operating margin, as reported, is a more relevant indicator of management’s ability to effectively employ BlackRock’s resources. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards to be met with the contribution of shares of BlackRock
stock by PNC has been excluded from operating income because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants’ option to put awarded shares to BlackRock, this non-cash charge will not impact BlackRock’s book value. Appreciation on
Rabbi trust assets related to BlackRock’s deferred compensation plans has been excluded because investment performance of these assets has a nominal impact on net income. We have excluded fund administration and servicing costs from the
operating margin calculation because these costs are a fixed, asset-based expense which can fluctuate based on the discretion of a third party.

BlackRock earnings in 2004 reflected a 20% increase in advisory fees driven by a growing base
of assets under management as well as a total of $18 million in tax benefits recorded in the first and fourth quarters of 2004, which were more than offset by the after-tax impact of $66 million of LTIP-related charges.

During 2004, BlackRock continued to operate in a global marketplace characterized by
substantial volatility. Highlights of BlackRock’s 2004 performance follow.

•

Assets under management at December 31, 2004 increased $33 billion, or 10%, compared with December 31, 2003. Growth in fixed income assets managed by BlackRock was the primary
factor in the increase. The increase reflected net new subscriptions of $20 billion and net market appreciation of $13 billion. Over the past five years, assets under management have grown at a compound annual rate of 16%, the majority of which was
attributable to new business activity.

•

The business ended 2004 with superior investment performance in fixed income and liquidity products and continued to experience favorable operating leverage in these areas.

•

The performance of the equity business improved following its 2003 restructuring.

Higher revenue in 2004 reflected increases in fees earned from a larger base of assets. Other income increased primarily due to strong sales
of BlackRock Solutions products and services and fees earned by the Advisory Services Group.

Apart from the LTIP charges and a $6 million impairment of an acquired contract, expenses increased in 2004 largely due to an increase in employee incentive compensation, salaries and benefits due to higher staffing
levels, higher legal and accounting service fees and higher marketing and professional expense related to new closed-end issuances.

Effective January 31, 2005, BlackRock acquired SSRM, the holding company of State Street Research & Management Company and SSR Realty Advisors Inc., from MetLife,
Inc. SSRM, through its subsidiaries, actively manages stock, bond, balanced and real estate portfolios for both institutional and individual investors with approximately $55 billion in assets under management at December 31, 2004. At closing,
MetLife, Inc. received approximately $285 million in cash and approximately 550,000 shares of BlackRock restricted class A common stock. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to BlackRock’s earnings. Additional cash
considerations, which could increase the purchase price by up to 25%, may be paid over 5 years contingent on certain measures.

At December 31.

Represents net assets serviced offshore.

PFPC earnings increased 9% in 2004 compared with 2003. Highlights of PFPC’s performance in 2004 follow.

•

PFPC continued to streamline operations during the year to facilitate pursuit of higher-margin business and increase efficiencies in lower margin businesses.

•

PFPC’s offshore revenues grew 40% and assets serviced offshore increased 36%.

•

Alternative investment net assets serviced increased 45%, as PFPC executed its strategy to pursue hedge fund and other alternative investment business.

•

Managed account services grew its asset base to $27 billion, an increase of 56% compared with December 31, 2003, reflecting the success of the ADVISORport separate accounts platform
and related sales efforts.

Fund servicing revenue increased $52
million in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting the positive impact of new sales of accounting/administration services, offshore growth and growth in alternative investment and custody assets serviced. In addition, $22 million of the increase
represented out-of-pocket and pass-through items that had no impact on earnings. These factors were partially offset by highly competitive pricing in certain of PFPC’s product areas and transfer agency client deconversion. Revenue loss
attributable to the sale of PFPC’s retirement services business during 2003 was largely replaced by the higher margin revenue from the ADVISORport acquisition that also occurred in 2003.

Operating expense increased $25 million, or 4%, in 2004 compared with 2003. Apart from the
out-of-pocket and pass-through items referred to above, the net impact of the ADVISORport and retirement services transactions reduced operating expenses by $9 million in 2004 compared with the prior year. PFPC also benefited by $31 million in
incremental cost savings initiatives in 2004. PFPC incurred higher depreciation of technology investments and other noncompensation expenses during 2004 which offset the benefits described above. These benefits were also partially offset by a lower
benefit from accretion of a single discounted client contract liability that ended during the second quarter of 2004.

PFPC’s 2004 earnings also benefited from a reduction in pretax financing costs of $15 million, attributable to the retirement of debt during 2004 and 2003 of $115
million and $125 million, respectively, with PNC affiliates and the refinancing of certain remaining debt obligations with PNC affiliates at more favorable terms. PFPC anticipates continued reductions of debt principal during 2005. This benefit was
partially offset by an $11 million reduction in nonoperating income, largely driven by an increase in non-debt balance sheet funding.

Effective January 2005, PFPC restructured portions of its remaining intercompany debt obligations given the rate environment at that time. Contractually, PFPC incurred $8
million in debt prepayment penalties to effect the restructuring, which is expected to be more than offset by resulting interest expense savings of approximately $10 million over 2005. The prepayment penalty will be reflected in PFPC’s first
quarter 2005 results.

For information regarding a first quarter 2005
settlement with a former transfer agency client, we direct you to Note 31 Subsequent Events in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

PFPC’s performance is partially dependent on the underlying performance of its fund clients and, in particular, their ability to
attract and retain customers. As a result, to the extent that PFPC clients’ businesses are adversely affected by ongoing governmental investigations into the practices of the mutual and hedge fund industries, PFPC’s results could be
impacted.

Increases in both accounting/administration and custody fund assets
at December 31, 2004 compared with the prior year-end resulted primarily from net new business, asset inflows from existing clients and generally positive equity market performance during 2004. Subaccounting shareholder accounts serviced by PFPC
increased in 2004 primarily due to net new business and growth in existing client accounts. Total assets serviced by PFPC amounted to $1.8 trillion at December 31, 2004 compared with $1.6 trillion at December 31, 2003.

We are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In

the key risk factors that affect us.

A sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could have one or more of
the following impacts on our business:

•

A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us,

•

A decrease in the value of our loans held for sale,

•

An increase or decrease in the usage of unfunded commitments, or

•

An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us. An
increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.

Given our business mix, and the fact that most of our assets and liabilities are financial in
nature, we tend to be particularly sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the financial markets. In addition to the impact on the economy generally, with some of the potential effects outlined above, changes in interest
rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us in one or more of the following ways:

•

Such changes could affect the value of certain of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments or the value of equity investments that we hold;

•

Such changes could affect the value of the assets that we manage or otherwise administer;

•

Such changes could affect the value of assets for which we provide processing services; or

•

To the extent to which we access capital markets to raise funds to support our business, such changes could affect the cost of such funds or our ability to raise such funds.

A more detailed description of aspects of the interest rate and
market risks facing us is included in the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.

The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”), have a significant impact on interest rates
and overall financial market performance, and thus can affect the activities and results of operations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as PNC and our subsidiaries. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to
regulate the national supply of bank credit. The Federal Reserve Board employs open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits to implement
its monetary policy objectives. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the following:

•

The overall level of bank loans,

•

Investments and deposits,

•

The interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits,

•

The price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, and

•

The level of inflation.

The Federal Reserve Board’s policies have a general impact on the United States and, to some extent, global economies, but also have a significant specific impact on bank holding companies and others in the
financial services industry, which specific impact is felt throughout PNC. By affecting market interest rates, these policies influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and, as
described above, can also affect the value of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Both due to the impact on rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the Federal Reserve Banks, these policies also
influence, to a significant extent, our cost of funding. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on our activities and results of operations.

Our pending acquisition of Riggs National
Corporation presents us with a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the transaction itself and to the integration of the remaining Riggs businesses into PNC. These risks and uncertainties include the following:

•

Completion of the transaction is dependent on, among other things, receipt of stockholder and regulatory approvals and regulatory waivers, the timing of which cannot be predicted
with precision at this point and which may not be received at all.

•

Successful completion of the transaction and our ability to realize the benefits that we anticipate from the acquisition also depend on the nature of any future developments with
respect to Riggs’ regulatory and legal issues, the ability to comply with the terms of all current or future requirements (including any related action plan) resulting from these issues, and the extent of future costs and expenses arising as a
result of these issues, including the impact of increased litigation risk and any claims for indemnification or advancement of costs.

•

Riggs’ regulatory and legal issues may cause reputational harm to PNC following the acquisition and integration of its business into ours.

•

The transaction may be materially more expensive to complete than anticipated as a result of unexpected factors or events.



•

The integration into PNC of the Riggs business and operations that we acquire, which will include conversion of Riggs’ different systems and procedures, may take longer or be
more costly than anticipated and may have unanticipated adverse results relating to Riggs’ or PNC’s existing businesses.

•

It may take longer than expected to realize the anticipated cost savings of the acquisition, and the anticipated cost savings may not be achieved in their entirety.

•

The anticipated strategic and other benefits of the acquisition to PNC are dependent in part on the future performance of Riggs’ business. We can provide no assurance as to
actual future results, which could be affected by various factors, including the risks and uncertainties generally related to the performance of PNC’s and Riggs’ businesses (with respect to Riggs, you may review Riggs’ SEC reports,
which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov) or due to factors related to the acquisition of Riggs and the process of integrating Riggs’ business at closing into PNC.

In addition to the pending Riggs acquisition, we grow our business from time to time by
acquiring other financial services companies. Other acquisitions generally present similar risks to those described above relating to the Riggs transaction. We could also be prevented from pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities due to
regulatory restraints.

C

OMPETITION

We operate in a highly competitive environment, both in terms of the products and services offered and the geographic markets in which we conduct business. This
environment could become even more competitive in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation in the financial services industry. We compete with the following:

•

Local, regional and national banks, thrifts and credit unions,

•

Non-bank financial institutions, such as investment banking firms, investment advisory firms, brokerage firms, investment companies, private equity firms, mutual fund complexes and
insurance companies, and

•

Other entities that offer financial and processing services.

Our competitive environment is also impacted by the growth of alternative delivery channels, in particular the internet, which facilitates competition by removing
geographic barriers to providing certain of our products and services and which provides an additional and non-traditional way in which companies seeking to provide banking and other financial services can distinguish themselves.

Technological advances and legislation, among other changes, have lowered barriers to entry,
have made it possible for non-bank institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks, and have increased the level of competition that we face. Many of our competitors benefit from fewer regulatory
constraints and lower cost structures, allowing for more competitive pricing of products and services. As a result, we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price our products and services on less advantageous terms to retain customers.

ERFORMANCE

Asset management revenue is primarily based on a percentage of the value of assets under management and performance
fees, in most cases expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on assets under management. A decline in the value of debt and equity instruments, among other things, could cause our asset management revenue to decline.

Investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of assets under
management. Poor investment performance could impair revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products. Also, performance fees could be lower or nonexistent. Additionally, the ability to attract funds
from existing and new clients might diminish.

ERVICING

Fund servicing fees are primarily derived from the market value of the assets and the number of shareholder accounts that
we administer for our clients. A rise in interest rates or a sustained weakness, weakening or volatility in the debt and equity markets could influence an investor’s decision to invest or maintain an investment in a mutual fund or other pooled
investment product. As a result, fluctuations may occur in the level or value of assets for which we provide processing services. A significant investor migration from mutual fund and other pooled investments could result in lower revenues for us by
reducing the assets and the number of shareholder accounts that we service. The fund servicing business is also highly competitive, with a relatively small number of providers. There has been and continues to be merger, acquisition and consolidation
activity in the financial services industry. Future mergers or consolidations of financial institutions or other financial intermediaries could impact the number of existing or potential fund servicing clients.

Our consolidated financial statements are
prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require
us to make estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.

We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when financial assets and liabilities are
required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments
for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash
flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.

REDIT

We maintain allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at levels that we believe are sufficient to absorb estimated probable
credit losses inherent in the portfolio. We determine the adequacy of the allowances based on periodic evaluations of the credit portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material
estimates, including, among others:

•

Expected default probabilities,

•

Loss given default,

•

Exposure at default,

•

Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans,

•

Value of collateral,

•

Estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and

•

General amounts for historical loss experience.

Our process also considers economic conditions, uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios. All of these factors may be
susceptible to significant change. Also, we base the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses to specific loan pools on historical loss trends and our judgment concerning those trends.

Commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are the most sensitive to changes in
assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We have allocated approximately $503 million, or 83%, of the total allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2004 to the commercial loan
category. This allocation also considers other relevant factors such as:

•

Actual versus estimated losses,

•

Regional and national economic conditions,

•

Business segment and portfolio concentrations,

•

Industry competition and consolidation,

•

The impact of government regulations, and

•

Risk of potential estimation or judgmental errors, including the accuracy of risk ratings.

To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future
earnings. See the following for additional information: Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit in the Credit Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report; and Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note
12 Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements, and Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses in the Statistical Information section in Item 8 of

ALUATION

At December 31, 2004, private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $470 million
compared with $531 million at December 31, 2003. We value private equity assets at each balance sheet date based primarily on either, in the case of limited partnership investments, the financial statements received from the general partner or, for
direct investments, the estimated fair value of the investments. There is a time lag in our receipt of the financial information that is the primary basis for the valuation of our limited partnership interests. We recognized in the fourth quarter of
2004 valuation changes related to limited partnership investments that reflected the impact of third quarter 2004 market conditions and performance of the underlying companies. Due to the nature of the direct investments, we must make assumptions as
to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among others, to determine the estimated fair value of the investments. The valuation procedures that we apply to direct investments include
techniques such as cash flow multiples for the entity, independent appraisals of the value of the entity or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. We value general partnership interests based on the underlying
investments of the partnership utilizing procedures consistent with those applied to direct investments.

We reflect changes in the value of equity management investments in our results of operations. Market conditions and actual performance of the companies that we invest in could differ from these assumptions, resulting
in lower valuations that could reduce earnings in future periods. Accordingly, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments.



Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights

Commercial mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) are intangible assets that represent the value of rights that arise from the servicing of commercial loan contracts. While servicing is inherent in most financial
assets, it becomes a distinct asset (a) when contractually separated from the underlying financial asset by sale or securitization of the asset with servicing retained or (b) through the separate purchase and assumption of the servicing. The value
of our MSR asset (both originated and purchased) arises from estimates of future revenues from contractually specified servicing fees, interest income and other ancillary revenues, net of estimated operating expenses which are expected to provide an
acceptable level of risk adjusted return for us as the servicer.

We estimate
the fair value of our MSR asset using a discounted cash flow methodology that calculates the net present value of future cash flows of the servicing portfolio over the estimated life of the asset based on various assumptions and market factors. The
most significant assumptions and market factors include:

•

Interest rates for escrow and deposit balance earnings,

•

Discount rates,

•

Estimated prepayment speeds, and

•

Estimated servicing costs.

We review the reasonableness of these factors based on expectations of the portfolio, market conditions, and loan characteristics.

Our commercial loan servicing portfolio is subject to various risks, the most significant being interest rate risk, which subject our MSR
asset to impairment risk. While our MSR asset is amortized over its estimated life in proportion to estimated net servicing income, it is also tested for impairment at a strata level on a quarterly basis. The impairment testing includes a positive
and negative scenario for sensitivity characteristics. If the estimated fair value of the MSR is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss would be recognized in the current period; however, any fair value in excess of the cost basis would
not be recognized as income. We include additional information in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 13 Goodwill And Other Intangible Assets and Note 15 Securitizations And Retained Interests in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
of this Report.

Lease Residuals

We provide financing for various types of equipment, aircraft, energy and power systems, and rolling stock through a variety of lease arrangements. Leases are carried at
the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Residual value insurance or guarantees by governmental entities cover a significant portion of the residual value. Residual values are subject
to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party,
or otherwise insured against, we bear the risk of ownership of the leased assets. This includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value, which could result in an
impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future. These residual values are reviewed for impairment no less than on an annual basis. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for
additional information.

Goodwill

Goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Most of our goodwill relates
to value inherent in the fund servicing and banking businesses. The value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and global
basis. This ability in turn relies upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value-added service features, and the ease of access to our services.

As such, goodwill value is supported ultimately by earnings, which is driven by the volume of business transacted and, for certain
businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. Lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to
impairment of goodwill, which could result in a charge and reduced earnings in the future. At least annually, management evaluates events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill. See Note 1
Accounting Policies and Note 13 Goodwill And Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

Revenue Recognition

We derive
net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including:

•

Lending,

•

Securities portfolio,

•

Investment management and fund servicing,

•

Customer deposits,

•

Loan servicing,

•

Brokerage services,

•

Sale of loans and securities,

•

Certain private equity activities, and

•

Securities and derivatives trading activities including foreign exchange.

We also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, selling various insurance products, providing
treasury management services and participating in certain capital market transactions.

The timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates, judgments, assumptions, and interpretation of contractual terms. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized



in any period due to changes in products, market conditions or industry norms. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

Income
Taxes

Because our ownership interest in BlackRock, as measured by value, is less than 80%, federal tax law requires us to file two consolidated
federal income tax returns: one for PNC and subsidiaries excluding the consolidated results of BlackRock and its subsidiaries, and a second return solely for BlackRock and its subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries also file state and local income
tax returns in many jurisdictions.

In the normal course of business, we and
our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations. In addition, filing requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions
are subject to differing interpretations.

We evaluate and assess the relative
risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculation after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax accruals
consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits. The result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate. We and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. In the event
we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter.

Our tax treatment of certain leasing transactions is currently being challenged by the IRS, as described in greater detail in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review
section of Item 7 of this Report.

Legal Contingencies

We are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, including those described in Note 5 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and others arising in the normal course of our business. We review these matters with internal and external legal counsel and accrue reserves when we determine that it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly review these accruals and adjust the reserves as appropriate to reflect changes in the status of the proceedings and claims.

The reserves that we establish for these types of contingencies are based upon our opinion of
the likely future outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims. The final resolution of legal and regulatory proceedings is frequently different, possibly significantly, from the resolution we anticipated. Also, we may not be able to
reasonably estimate the loss from a proceeding even if some liability is probable or the actual loss may be different from an estimated loss. As a result, our ultimate financial exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims may be
substantially different from what is reflected in the related reserves.

See Note 22 Stock-Based Compensation Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 of this Report for a description of the BlackRock LTIP.

Based on the
price performance of its common shares, BlackRock management determined that full vesting of the LTIP awards was probable as of September 30, 2004, and as a result recorded a charge and a related liability in its third quarter 2004 results. This
charge took into account the value of the awards granted through September 30, 2004 and the applicable service period. We reported a pretax charge totaling $96 million, including $89 million of compensation expense, $2 million of employee benefits
expense and $5 million of “Other” noninterest expense in our Consolidated Statement Of Income. The after-tax impact on our third quarter 2004 results after taking into account the adjustment for minority interests (we own approximately 71%
of BlackRock) was $42 million, or $.15 per diluted share. This includes a pro rata share of the estimated dilution of our investment in BlackRock that is expected to occur in 2007 when we transfer shares of BlackRock stock to fund a portion of the
LTIP Awards.

Fourth quarter 2004 LTIP pretax charges reported by PNC totaled
$14 million, comprised of $13 million of compensation expense and $1 million of “Other” noninterest expense.

We expect to report additional pretax charges of approximately $15 million per quarter through December 2006 related to the remaining service period of the LTIP Awards
granted to date, assuming the LTIP Awards vest or full vesting remains probable.

Additional information on the third quarter 2004 LTIP charge is included in our and BlackRock’s Current Reports on Form 8-K dated October 6, 2004.

We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (“plan” or “pension plan”) covering eligible employees. Retirement benefits are
derived from a cash balance formula based on compensation levels, age and length of service. Pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. Plan assets are currently
approximately 60% invested in equity investments with most of the remainder invested in fixed income instruments. Plan fiduciaries determine and review the plan’s investment policy.

We calculate the expense associated with the pension plan in accordance with SFAS 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,”
and we use assumptions and methods that are compatible with the requirements of SFAS 87, including a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value. On an annual basis, we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan,
including the discount rate, rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets. Neither the discount rate nor the compensation increase assumptions significantly affect pension expense. However, the expected long-term return on
assets assumption does significantly affect pension expense. Actual investment returns also significantly affect expense, as each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes the following year’s
expense to change by up to $3 million. Below are the effects of certain changes in assumptions, using 2005 estimated expense as a baseline.

Estimated

Increase to

Pension

Expense

(In millions)

.5% decrease in discount rate

$1

.5% decrease in expected long-term return on assets


.5% increase in compensation rate


We currently estimate a pretax $7
million benefit to pension expense in 2005 compared with pretax expense of $10 million in 2004.

The primary reasons for the expected decrease in pension expense in 2005 are favorable returns on investment assets in 2004, which reduce amortization of actuarial losses and increase the asset used to calculate
expected returns for 2005, and plan modifications relating to PFPC, as future retirement benefits will accrue only under a defined contribution plan.

In accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 132 (Revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,” we may have to eliminate
any prepaid pension asset and recognize a minimum pension liability if the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets at year-end. We would recognize the corresponding charge as a component of other comprehensive income and
it would reduce total shareholders’ equity, but it would not affect net income. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of plan assets was $1.492 billion, which exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation of $1.111 billion. The status at year-end
2005 will depend primarily upon 2005 investment returns and the level of contributions, if any, made to the plan by us during 2005.

Plan asset investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements. However, contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial
assumptions. Investment performance will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years. Also, current law sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan. In any event, any large near-term contributions to the plan
will be at our discretion, as we expect that the minimum required contributions under the law will be minimal or zero for several years.

We maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results, including one qualified pension plan for United National employees and
various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees. On March 31, 2004, we merged into our plan one defined benefit plan covering some employees of United National. We merged the remaining United National plan into our plan
during the fourth quarter of 2004. We contributed $11 million to the United National plans during the first quarter of 2004. Expense associated with the United National plans was minimal for 2004.

8 of this Report for additional information.

ANAGEMENT

We encounter risk as part of the normal
course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. This Risk Management section first provides an overview of the risk measurement, control strategies, and monitoring aspects of our corporate-level risk
management processes. Following that discussion is an analysis of the risk management process for what we view as our primary areas of risk: credit, operational, liquidity, and market. The discussion of market risk is further



subdivided into interest rate, trading, and equity and other investment risk areas. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and
liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section of this Report. In appropriate places within this section, historical performance is also addressed.

O

VERVIEW

As a
financial services organization, we take a certain amount of risk in every business decision. For example, every time we open an account or approve a loan for a customer, process a payment, hire a new employee, or implement a new computer system, we
incur a certain amount of risk. As an organization, we must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with our business activities. Risk management is not about eliminating risks, but about identifying and accepting
risks and then effectively managing them so to optimize shareholder value.

The
key to effective risk management is to be proactive in identifying, measuring, evaluating, and monitoring risk on an ongoing basis. Risk management practices support decision-making, improve the success rate for new initiatives, and strengthen the
organization.

VERVIEW

We support risk management through a governance structure involving the
Board, senior management and a corporate risk management organization.

Although our Board as a whole is responsible generally for oversight of risk management, committees of the Board provide oversight to specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure.

We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed
within our desired risk profile. The Executive Risk Management Committee (“ERMC”), consisting of senior management executives, provides oversight for the establishment and implementation of new comprehensive risk management initiatives,
reviews enterprise level risk profiles and discusses key risk issues.

The
corporate risk management organization has the following key roles:

•

Facilitate the identification, assessment and monitoring of risk across PNC,

•

Provide support and oversight to the businesses, and

•

Identify and implement risk management best practices, as appropriate.

EASUREMENT

We conduct risk
measurement activities specific to each area of risk. The primary vehicle for aggregation of enterprise-wide risk is a comprehensive risk management methodology that is based on economic capital. This primary risk aggregation measure is supplemented
with secondary measures of risk to arrive at an estimate of enterprise-wide risk. The economic capital framework is a measure of potential losses above and beyond expected losses. Potential one year losses are capitalized to a level commensurate
with a financial institution with an A rating by the credit rating agencies. Economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses (Credit Risk), fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments (Market Risk),
failure of people, processes or systems (Operational Risk), and income losses associated with declining volumes, margins and/or fees, and the fixed cost structure of the business (Business Risk). We estimate credit and market risks at an exposure
level while we estimate the remaining risk types at an institution or business segment level. We routinely compare the output of our economic capital model with industry benchmarks.

Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers,
purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in banking and is one of our most significant risks.

Approved risk tolerances, in addition to credit policies and procedures, set portfolio objectives for the level of credit risk. We have
established guidelines for acceptable levels of total borrower exposure, problem loans, and other credit measures. We seek to achieve our credit portfolio objectives by maintaining a customer base that is diverse in borrower exposure and industry
types. We use loan participations with third parties, loan sales and syndications, and the purchase of credit derivatives to reduce risk concentrations.

The credit granting businesses maintain direct responsibility for credit risk within PNC. The Corporate Credit Policy area provides independent oversight to the
measurement, monitoring and reporting of PNC’s credit risk and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. Credit Risk Review also provides an independent assessment of the credit risk profile and the findings from targeted reviews.



Nonperforming, Past Due And Potential Problem Assets

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, nonaccrual loans held for sale or foreclosed, and other assets. In addition, certain
performing assets have interest payments that are past due or have the potential for future repayment problems.

Nonperforming Assets By Type

(a)

Includes troubled debt restructured loans held for sale of $2 million as of December 31, 2004 and $10 million as of December 31, 2003.

(b)

Excludes nonperforming equity management assets carried at estimated fair value of $32 million at December 31, 2004 and $37 million at December 31, 2003 and included in other assets
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts include troubled debt restructured assets of $11 million at December 31, 2004 and $5 million at December 31, 2003.

The decline in nonperforming loans held for sale at December 31, 2004 compared with December 31, 2003 reflected reductions in principal
balances and sales of nonperforming loans during 2004.

The foreclosed lease
assets at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 primarily represent our repossession of collateral related to a single airline industry credit during the second quarter of 2003 that was previously classified as a nonaccrual loan. This asset is
currently leased to a third party.

The amount of nonperforming loans that was
current as to principal and interest was $44 million at December 31, 2004 and $116 million at December 31, 2003. The amount of nonperforming loans held for sale that was current as to principal and interest was zero at December 31, 2004 and $4
million at December 31, 2003.

Nonperforming Assets By Business

At December 31, 2004, Wholesale
Banking had nonperforming loans held for sale of $3 million, which are included in the preceding table.

Change In Nonperforming Assets

Weakness in the economy or other
factors that affect asset quality could result in an increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults, and in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and provision for credit losses in future periods.

Accruing Loans And Loans Held For Sale Past Due 90 Days Or More

Loans and loans held for sale that are
not included in nonperforming or past due categories but cause us to be uncertain about the borrower’s ability to comply with existing repayment terms over the next six months, totaled $65 million and zero, respectively, at December 31, 2004
compared with $94 million and $4 million, respectively at December 31, 2003. Approximately 82% of these loans are in the Wholesale Banking portfolio.

Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit

We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb losses from the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on quarterly
assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. While we make allocations to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all loan losses.

In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we maintain an allowance for unfunded
loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. This
methodology is similar to the methodology we use for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses.



We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using a method prescribed by SFAS 114, “Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.” All nonperforming loans are considered impaired under SFAS 114. Specific allowances for individual loans over a set dollar threshold are determined by our Special Asset Committee based on an analysis of the
present value of the loan’s expected future cash flows discounted at its effective interest rate, its observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. We establish a minimum specific allowance on all impaired loans at
the applicable pool reserve allocation for similar loans.

Allocations to
non-impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans (pool reserve allocations) are assigned to pools of loans as defined by our business structure and internal risk rating categories.

Key elements of the pool reserve methodology include:

•

Probability of default (“PD”), which is derived from historical default analyses and is a function of the borrower’s risk rating grade and expected loan term;

•

Loss given default (“LGD”), which is derived from historical loss data and is a function of the loan’s collateral value and other structural factors that may affect
our ultimate ability to collect on the loan; and

•

Exposure at default (“EAD”), which is derived from banking industry and our own exposure at default data.

Our pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PDs, LGDs
and EADs. In general, a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for non-impaired commercial loans. Our commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are most
sensitive to changes in the key risk parameters and pool reserve loss rates. To illustrate, if we increase the pool reserve loss rates by 5% for all categories of nonimpaired commercial loans, then the aggregate of the allowance for loan and lease
losses and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit would increase by $25 million. Additionally, other factors such as the rate of migration in the severity of problem loans or changes in the maturity distribution of the loans
will contribute to the final pool reserve allocations.

We make consumer
(including residential mortgage) loan allocations at a total portfolio level by consumer product line based on historical loss experience. We compute a four-quarter average loss rate from net charge-offs for the prior four quarters as a percentage
of the average loans outstanding in those quarters. We apply this loss rate to loans outstanding at the end of the current period to determine the consumer loan allocation.

The final loan reserve allocations are based on this methodology and our judgment of other qualitative factors that may include, among
others:

•

Regional and national economic conditions,

•

Business segment and portfolio concentrations,

•

Historical versus estimated losses,

•

Model risk, and

•

Changes to the level of credit risk in the portfolio.

We establish reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not considered in the specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies, such as, but not limited to,
potential judgment and data errors. Furthermore, events may have occurred as of the reserve evaluation date that are not yet reflected in the risk measures or characteristics of the portfolio due to inherent lags in information. Our evaluation of
these factors and other relevant factors, such as the imprecision in estimating probable losses, determines the level of reserves established at the evaluation date. The total amount of reserves for these factors was $101 million at December 31,
2004 and $116 million at December 31, 2003 and were assigned in the tables below to loan categories and to business segments based on the relative specific and pool allocation amounts. This portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses
represented 17% of the total allowance and .23% of total loans at December 31, 2004 and 18% of the total allowance and .32% of total loans at December 31, 2003.

Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses

The provision for credit losses for
2004 and the evaluation of the allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit as of December 31, 2004 reflected changes in loan portfolio composition, the impact of refinements to our reserve methodology,
and changes in asset quality

.

The provision includes amounts for probable losses on loans and credit exposure related to unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. In addition, as described below, the allowance for loan and lease losses
was impacted during 2004 by a change in our charge-off policy for smaller nonperforming commercial loans that occurred during the first quarter of 2004.

Rollforward Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses



The allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans was 424% and as a percent of total loans was 1.40% at December 31,
2004. The comparable percentages at year end 2003 were 238% and 1.74%.

The reduction during 2004 in the
allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit was due to refinements to the key risk parameters of the pool reserve methodology related to the Wholesale Banking business segment, partially offset by growth in the portfolio’s
unfunded loan commitments.

Charge-Offs And Recoveries

Net charge-offs declined $96 million
for 2004 compared with 2003. Net charge-offs for 2003 included $42 million related to a single Wholesale Banking loan to a wholesale goods/retail customer and $26 million related to a single airline industry credit for which a substantial reserve
had been provided at December 31, 2002. The sale of the vehicle leasing business in 2004 also resulted in lower net charge-offs in 2004 compared with the prior year.

During the first quarter of 2004, we changed our policy for recognizing charge-offs on smaller nonperforming commercial loans. As a result,
we recognized an additional $24 million of gross charge-offs for the first quarter of 2004. For the remaining nine months of 2004, this portion of the portfolio experienced a reduction in gross charge-offs and an increase in recoveries from expected
levels. The impact of this change in future periods is not expected to be significant.

Credit Default Swaps

Credit default swaps provide, for a fee, an assumption by a third party of a portion of
the credit risk related to the underlying financial instruments. We use the contracts primarily to mitigate credit risk associated with commercial lending activities and convertible bond trading. At December 31, 2004, we used credit default swaps
with $336 million in notional amount to reduce credit risk associated with commercial lending activities and $23 million in notional amount to reduce risk associated with convertible arbitrage trading. The comparable amount was $166 million at
December 31, 2003 for commercial lending activities. Credit default swaps are included in the Free-Standing Derivatives table in the Financial Derivatives section of Item 7 of this Report. We realized net losses in connection with credit default
swaps of $4.4 million during 2004 and $4.6 million in 2003.

Interest
Rate Derivative Risk Participation Agreements

We enter into risk participation agreements to share credit exposure with other financial
counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or take on credit exposure to generate revenue. Risk participation agreements entered into subsequent to June 30, 2003 used by us to mitigate credit risk had a notional amount of $200
million at December 31, 2004 compared with $35 million at December 31, 2003. Risk participation agreements in which we assumed credit exposure had a notional amount of $30 million at December 31, 2004. There were none as of December 31, 2003.

Agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2003 are considered to be financial
guarantees and, therefore, are not included in the Financial Derivatives section of Item 7 of this Report. Risk participation agreements entered prior to July 1, 2003 used by us to mitigate credit risk had a notional amount of $36 million at
December 31, 2004 compared with $32 million at December 31, 2003. Risk participation agreements entered into in which we assumed credit risk exposure had a total notional amount of $24 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $49 million at
December 31, 2003.

Operational risk is defined as the risk of financial loss or other damage to us resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes or systems, human factors, or from external events. Operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways, including but not limited to the following:

•

Errors related to transaction processing and systems,

•

Breaches of the system of internal controls and compliance requirements,

•

Business interruptions, and

•

Execution of unauthorized transactions and fraud by employees or third parties.



Operational losses may arise from legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance with contracts, laws or
regulations.

To monitor and control operational risk, we maintain a
comprehensive framework including policies and a system of internal controls that is designed to manage risk and to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of PNC. Management at each business unit is primarily
responsible for its operational risk management program, given that operational risk management is integral to direct business management and most easily effected at the business unit level. Corporate Operational Risk Management, reporting to the
Chief Risk Officer, oversees day-to-day operation risk management activities.

Technology Risk

The technology risk management program is a significant component of the operational risk framework. We have an
integrated security and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure a secure, sound, and compliant infrastructure for information management. The technology risk management process is aligned with the strategic direction of the
businesses and is integrated into the technology management culture, structure and practices. The application of this framework across the enterprise helps to support comprehensive and reliable internal controls.

Our business resiliency program manages the organization’s capabilities to provide
services in the case of an event. Prioritization of investments in people, processes, technology and facilities are based on different types of events, business risk and criticality. Comprehensive testing validates our resiliency capabilities on an
ongoing basis, and an integrated governance model is designed to help assure transparent management reporting.

Insurance

As a component of our risk management practices, we purchase insurance programs designed to protect
us against accidental loss or losses which, in the aggregate, may significantly affect personnel, property, financial objectives, or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups.

PNC, through subsidiary companies, Alpine Indemnity Limited and PNC Insurance Corp.,
participates as a reinsurer for its general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation programs and as a direct writer for its property and certified domestic terrorism programs. PNC’s risks associated with its participation
as a reinsurer or direct writer for these programs are mitigated through policy limits, annual aggregate limits, umbrella/excess liability coverage and reinsurance ceded beyond per occurrence deductible limits.

Liquidity risk is the risk of potential loss if we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. We manage liquidity risk to
help ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal “business as usual” and stressful circumstances.

Asset and Liability Management (“ALM”), reporting to the Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, is accountable for managing
the liquidity position within the limits and guidelines set forth in our risk management policies. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight for the measurement, monitoring and reporting of PNC’s liquidity risk and reports to the
Chief Risk Officer.

We typically maintain our liquidity position through:

•

A large and stable deposit base derived from our retail and wholesale banking activities,

•

A portfolio of liquid investment securities,

•

Diversified sources of short-term and long-term wholesale funding, and

•

Significant unused borrowing capacity at both the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve discount window.

Liquid assets consist of short-term investments (federal funds sold and other short-term
investments) and securities available for sale. At December 31, 2004, our liquid assets totaled $18.6 billion, with $8.1 billion pledged as collateral for borrowings, trust, and other commitments.

PNC Bank, N.A. is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank and as such has access to advances
from the Federal Home Loan Bank secured generally by residential mortgages, other real estate related loans, and mortgage-backed securities. At December 31, 2004, our total unused borrowing capacity from the Federal Home Loan Bank under current
collateral requirements was $17.3 billion.

We can also obtain funding through
alternative forms of borrowing, including federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and short-term and long-term debt issuance. On July 30, 2004, PNC Bank, N.A. established a program to offer up to $20 billion in senior and subordinated
unsecured debt obligations with maturities of more than nine months. As of December 31, 2004, PNC Bank, N.A. had issued $1 billion of debt under this program, including $500 million of 18-month floating rate notes, due March 2006 issued during the
third quarter of 2004 with interest payable at the rate of 1-month LIBOR minus 6 basis points, and $500 million of 5.25% Subordinated Notes due 2017 issued during the fourth quarter of 2004. These notes are not redeemable or subject to repayment at
the option of the holder prior to maturity. On December 2, 2004, PNC Bank, N.A. established a program to offer up to $3.0 billion of its commercial paper. As of December 31, 2004, no commercial paper had been issued under this program.

On March 10, 2005, PNC issued two series of senior debt under PNC’s effective shelf
registration statements. The first series consisted of $350 million of 4.2% Senior Notes due 2008 and the second series consisted of $350 million of 4.5% Senior Notes due 2010. The Senior Notes due 2008 were issued at a price of 99.953%, resulting
in proceeds to PNC of approximately $350 million. The Senior Notes due 2010 were issued at a price of 99.774%, resulting in proceeds to PNC of approximately $349 million. Neither series of Senior Notes is redeemable by PNC or subject to repayment at
the option of the holder prior to maturity.



The parent company’s routine funding needs consist primarily of the return of capital to shareholders (dividends and
share repurchases), debt service and the funding of its non-bank affiliates and acquisitions. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet these requirements over the succeeding
twelve-month period. In managing parent company liquidity we consider funding sources, such as expected dividends to be received from PNC Bank, N.A. and potential debt issuance, and discretionary funding uses, the most significant of which is the
external dividend to be paid on PNC’s stock.

The principal source of
parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, N.A., which may be impacted by the following:

•

Capital needs,

•

Laws and regulations,

•

Corporate policies,

•

Contractual restrictions, and

•

Other factors.

Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. We
provide additional information on these limitations in Note 4 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and include such information here by reference. The amount available for dividend payments to
the parent company by PNC Bank, N.A. without prior regulatory approval was approximately $995 million at December 31, 2004.

In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, N.A., other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and short-term investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments
from other subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2004, the parent company had approximately $796 million in funds available from its cash and short-term investments.

We can generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of securities in public or private markets. At December 31,
2004, we had unused capacity under effective shelf registration statements of approximately $2.7 billion of debt or equity securities (of which approximately $700 million was used for the senior notes issues in March 2005 referred to above) and $100
million of trust preferred capital securities. The parent company also had an unused non-reciprocal credit facility of $200 million at December 31, 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, $600 million of parent company senior debt matured. As of
December 31, 2004, there were no parent company contractual obligations with maturities less than one year.

Market risk is the risk of a loss in
earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities:

•

Traditional banking activities of taking deposits and extending loans,

•

Private equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and

•

Trading in fixed income products, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange, as a result of customer activities, underwriting, and proprietary trading.

We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure,
monitor, and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Board Finance Committee and ERMC.

Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of
gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay
on liabilities. Because of repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but the economic values of these assets and liabilities as
well. ALM centrally manages interest rate risk. ALM is responsible for making investment and trading decisions within authorized limits and guidelines for both economic value of equity (“EVE”) and net interest income. In managing interest
rate risk, we limit our reliance on a particular interest rate scenario and position the balance sheet to grow net interest income and net interest margin within our targeted risk profile. We use the following to achieve these objectives:

•

Securities purchases and sales,

•

Mix of short-term and long-term funding,

•

Financial derivatives, and

•

Other capital markets instruments.

The activities of ALM are subject to interest rate risk limits and certain policies approved by ALCO and the Board Finance Committee.



Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003
follow:

Interest Sensitivity Analysis

In addition to measuring the effect on
net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. The following Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios table
reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12 month periods assuming the PNC Economist’s most likely rate forecast, implied market forward rates and a lower/flatter rate scenario. We are inherently sensitive to a
flatter yield curve.

When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions
about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business, and the behavior of existing positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate
scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in the following table. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at market rates.

All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario
where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.

Over the last several years, we have taken steps to
position our balance sheet to benefit from rising long-term interest rates under the belief that the current environment, characterized by recently low rates, will not continue over the longer term. Going forward, we believe that we have the deposit
funding base and flexibility to change our investment profile to take advantage of opportunities presented by a higher rate environment.

Our trading activities include the underwriting of fixed income and equity securities, as well as customer-driven and
proprietary trading in fixed income securities, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange. Trading activities are confined to financial instruments and financial derivatives.

For each trading group (e.g., fixed income, derivatives, foreign exchange), we have implemented a set of risk limits that govern that
particular group. Our overall corporate trading risk policy governs the nature and allocation of these limits.

We use a variety of statistical and non-statistical measurements to assess the level of market risk arising from trading activities. We use value-at-risk (“VaR”) as the primary means to measure and monitor
market risk in trading activities. VaR offers a common measure to compare trading risk across portfolios with exposures to different types of market factors. As required under the Market Risk Amendment to the Basel Accord, we calculate risk-weighted
capital for trading activities, which is driven by average VaR usage. For internal risk management purposes, we also estimate the amount of economic capital required at a 99.9% level of confidence by trading activities over a one-year horizon. This
measure is driven by both average VaR usage and potential future usage based on portfolio VaR limits.

An enterprise-wide VaR limit on trading activities is established by the Board Finance Committee. VaR limits for individual business units are established by ALCO.

The following table shows VaR usage for 2004 by product type:

VaR Usage by Product Type

To help ensure the integrity of the
models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprisewide, we use a process known as backtesting. The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of trading-related gains or losses against the VaR levels that were
calculated at the close of the prior day. We would expect a maximum of two to three instances a year in which actual losses exceeded the prior day VaR measure. During the full year of 2004, there were no such instances at the enterprise-wide level.
This indicates that PNC uses a conservative enterprise-wide VaR measure. The following graph shows a comparison of enterprise-wide trading-related gains and losses against prior day VaR for the period.

Total trading-related revenue was $126 million in
2004, $125 million for 2003 and $90 million for 2002. Trading-related revenue includes both net interest income and noninterest income from trading activities. Enterprise-wide trading-related losses occurred on 71 of the 253 business days in 2004.

Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In
addition to extending credit, taking deposits, and underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations, and later-stage growth financings
in a variety of industries. We have investments in non-affiliated and affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments, although new investments in non-affiliated funds will be minimal. The economic and/or book value of these
investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors.

The primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is the concept of economic capital. The economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk. It is the worst-case value
depreciation over one year within 99.9% confidence level. Given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight of the valuation
process.

PNC Equity Management Corp. (“PNC EMC”) and other PNC
business units manage our equity and other investment activities. The Board Finance Committee approves policies and capital limits related to investment activities across PNC. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the
approved policy limits and guidelines.



Private Equity

The private equity portfolio is comprised of investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. We continue to make private equity investments at a moderate pace, consistent with current market conditions.

Private equity investments are reported at fair value. Changes in the values of private
equity investments are reflected in our results of operations. Due to the nature of the direct investments, we must make assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among
other factors, to determine the estimated fair value of the investments. Market conditions and actual performance of the investments could differ from these assumptions. Accordingly, lower valuations may occur that could adversely impact earnings in
future periods. Also, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments. See Private Equity Asset Valuation in the Critical Accounting Policies And Judgments section of Item 7 of this Report for
additional information.

At December 31, 2004, private equity investments
carried at estimated fair value totaled $470 million compared with $531 million at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 39% of the amount is invested directly in a variety of companies and approximately 61% is invested in
various limited partnerships. Private equity unfunded commitments totaled $119 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $176 million at December 31, 2003.

Other Investments

We also make investments in affiliated and
non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Such investments include investments in BlackRock’s mutual funds, hedge funds, and CDOs. The economic values could be driven by either the fixed-income market or
the equity markets, or both. As of December 31, 2004, major investments of this type included low income housing tax credits and capitalized servicing rights for commercial mortgage loans.

APITAL

Our Economic Capital Committee governs the measurement of economic capital. This Committee meets at least quarterly to review economic capital measurements and approve
methodology changes. The economic capital framework is a measure of the potential losses above and beyond expected losses. Potential one year losses are capitalized to a level consistent with a financial institution with an A rating by the credit
rating agencies. Economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses (Credit Risk), fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments (Market Risk), failure of people, processes or systems (Operational Risk),
and income losses associated with declining volumes, margins and/or fees, and the fixed cost structure of the business (Business Risk). We estimate credit and market risks at an exposure level while we estimate the remaining risk types at an
institution or business segment level. We routinely compare the output of our economic capital model with industry benchmarks.

NFLATION

Our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. During periods of inflation, monetary assets lose
value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains. The concept of purchasing power, however, is not an adequate indicator of the effect of inflation on banks because it does not take into account
changes in interest rates, which are an important determinant of our earnings.

ERIVATIVES

We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and
liability risk management process to help manage interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate and total
return swaps, interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments used by us for interest rate risk management.

Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. For interest rate swaps and total return swaps, caps and floors and futures
contracts, only periodic cash payments and, with respect to caps and floors, premiums, are exchanged. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount.

Not all elements of interest rate, market and credit risk are addressed through the use of
financial or other derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market characteristics, among other reasons.

Accounting Hedges-Fair Value Hedging Strategies

We enter into interest rate and total return swaps, caps, floors and interest rate futures derivative contracts to hedge designated commercial mortgage loans held for sale, commercial loans, bank notes, senior debt
and subordinated debt for changes in fair value primarily due to changes in interest rates. Adjustments related to the ineffective portion of fair value hedging instruments are recorded in interest income, interest expense or noninterest income
depending on the hedged item.



Accounting Hedges-Cash Flow Hedging Strategy

We enter into interest rate swap contracts to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest
income. The fair value of these derivatives is reported in other assets or other liabilities and offset in accumulated other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the derivatives. When the hedged transaction culminates, any unrealized
gains or losses related to these swap contracts are removed from accumulated other comprehensive income and are included in interest income. Any ineffectiveness of the strategy, as defined by our documented policies and procedures, is reported in
interest income.

Free-Standing Derivatives

To accommodate customer needs, we also enter into financial derivative transactions primarily consisting of interest rate swaps, caps, floors and foreign exchange and
equity contracts. We manage our market risk exposure from customer positions through transactions with third-party dealers. The credit risk associated with derivatives executed with customers is essentially the same as that involved in extending
loans and is subject to normal credit policies. We may obtain collateral based on our assessment of the customer.

Also included in free-standing derivatives are transactions that we enter into for risk management and proprietary purposes that are not designated as accounting hedges,
primarily interest rate basis swaps, total return swaps, credit default swaps and certain interest rate-lock loan origination commitments as well as commitments to buy or sell mortgage loans.

Basis swaps are agreements involving the exchange of payments, based on notional amounts, of
two floating rate financial instruments denominated in the same currency, one pegged to one reference rate and the other tied to a second reference rate (e.g., swapping payments tied to one-month LIBOR for payments tied to three-month LIBOR). We use
these contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced interest rate.

Interest rate-lock commitments for, as well as commitments to buy or sell, real estate mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered free-standing derivatives. Our interest rate exposure on the rate lock
commitments is economically hedged with pay-fixed interest rate swaps and forward sale commitments. These contracts mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced rate.

We purchase credit default swaps to mitigate the economic impact of credit losses on
specifically identified existing lending relationships. These derivatives typically are based upon the change in value, due to changing credit spreads, of publicly-issued bonds issued by our customer.

We enter into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other
financial counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue. We will be required to make/receive payments under these guaranties if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under
certain credit agreements. Agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2003 are considered financial guarantees. Agreements entered into after June 30, 2003 are considered free-standing derivatives.

We occasionally purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded
derivative. At the inception of the financial instrument, we assess whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument (host contract), whether
the financial instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative and the host contract is measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument
would meet the definition of a derivative. If the embedded derivative does not meet these three conditions, the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument and be recorded apart from the host contract and carried at fair value with
changes recorded in current earnings.

Free-standing derivatives also include
positions we take based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and the market based upon stated risk management objectives.



The following tables provide the notional amount and fair value of financial derivatives used for risk management and
designated as accounting hedges as well as free-standing derivatives at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. Weighted-average interest rates presented are based on contractual terms, if fixed, or the implied forward yield curve at each
respective date, if floating. The credit risk amounts of these derivatives as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 are presented in Note 20 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Summary Results

Consolidated net income for 2003 was $1.001 billion or $3.55 per diluted share compared with $1.184 billion or $4.15 per diluted share for 2002.

Results for 2003 included expenses totaling $87 million after taxes, or $.31 per diluted share, in connection with the DOJ agreement,
including related legal and consulting costs. Net income for 2003 also included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that negatively impacted earnings by $28 million, or $.10 per diluted share.

Results for 2002 included a net loss from discontinued operations of $16 million, or $.05 per
diluted share. See Note 6 Discontinued Operations in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income was $1.996 billion for 2003
compared with $2.197 billion for 2002. Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $2.006 billion and the net interest margin was 3.64% for 2003, a decline of $204 million and 35 basis points compared with 2002. The low interest rate
environment, decreases in commercial loans, prepayments in the residential mortgage loan portfolio, and sales and maturities of securities that were replaced at lower yields resulted in a decline in taxable-equivalent net interest income compared
with 2002.

Provision For Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was $177 million for 2003 compared with $309 million for 2002. The decline compared with the prior year was primarily due to the overall
improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio during 2003. The provision for 2002 reflected additions to reserves for Wholesale Banking and losses related to Market Street liquidity facilities.

Net charge-offs were $211 million, or .59% of average loans, for 2003 compared with $223
million, or .60%, of average loans, for 2002. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of $90 million of charge-offs in 2002 related to Market Street that more than offset the impact of two significant charge-offs in 2003. Net charge-offs for
2003 included $42 million related to a single loan to a wholesale goods/retail customer and $26 million related to a single airline industry credit for which a substantial reserve had been provided at December 31, 2002.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income was $3.257 billion for 2003 compared with $3.197 billion for 2002, an increase of $60 million, or 2%.

Asset management fees totaled $861 million for 2003, an increase of $8 million compared with 2002. Consolidated assets under management were $354 billion at December 31,
2003 compared with $313 billion at December 31, 2002. Growth in fixed income assets at BlackRock was the primary factor in the increase in assets under management during 2003.

Fund servicing fees decreased $54 million, to $762 million, in 2003 compared with the prior year. Fund servicing fees for 2002 included the
favorable impact of $13 million of fees related to the renegotiation of a client contract at PFPC and an additional $15 million related to PFPC’s retirement services business, which was sold effective June 30, 2003. Apart from these items, the
positive impact of new sales of accounting/administration services and offshore growth in 2003 was more than offset by revenue declines resulting from client attrition and the impact of competitive market conditions on pricing.

Service charges on deposits totaled $239 million for 2003 and $227 million for 2002. The
increase for 2003 reflected higher volumes partially offset by lower monthly service charges due to higher sales and continued implementation of free checking.

Brokerage fees were $184 million for 2003, down $11 million compared with 2002. The decrease compared with 2002 reflected the impact of lower trading volumes and lower
annuity fees in 2003. While brokerage activity improved in the latter part of 2003, this did not compensate for the lower trading volumes earlier in the year.

Consumer services revenue of $251 million for 2003 represented an increase of $12 million or 5% compared with 2002. Higher revenue in 2003 was primarily due to the
impact of additional fees from debit card transactions related to higher transaction volumes and additional fees from ATM transactions.

Corporate services revenue totaled $485 million for 2003 compared with $526 million for 2002. Net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to the liquidation of
institutional loans held for sale included in this line item totaled $69 million in 2003 and $147 million in 2002. Partially offsetting this decline were net gains on sales of commercial mortgages that totaled $52 million for 2003, an increase of
$21 million compared with 2002. Cash management and letters of credit fees totaled $250 million, a $14 million increase compared with 2002. This increase also partially offset the decline in net gains in excess of valuation adjustments.

Equity management (private equity activities) net losses on portfolio investments were $25
million in 2003 compared with net losses of $51 million in 2002.

Net
securities gains were $116 million in 2003 and $89 million for 2002. Net securities gains for 2003 included $25 million related to the liquidation in early 2003 of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions.

Other noninterest income totaled $384 million in 2003 compared with $303 million for 2002.
Other noninterest income from investments held by certain VIEs totaled $19



million for 2003 due solely to our adoption of FIN 46 in 2003. Net trading income included in other noninterest income increased $35 million in 2003 compared
with the prior year. Other noninterest income for 2002 included the impact of an additional $20 million benefit resulting from a reduction in the put option liability related to the 2002 National Bank of Canada asset acquisition and a $14 million
gain on the sale of a real estate investment.

Noninterest Expense

Total noninterest expense was $3.476 billion for 2003, an increase of $249 million or 8% compared with 2002. The efficiency ratio was 66% for 2003 and
60% for 2002 on a continuing operations basis.

Noninterest expense for 2003
included the following:

•

$120 million recognized in connection with the DOJ agreement, including $5 million of related legal and consulting costs,

•

$36 million due to our adoption of FIN 46,

•

$29 million of costs paid in connection with the liquidation of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions, the impact of which was mostly offset by related net
securities gains included in noninterest income, and

•

$25 million of facilities charges related to leased space consistent with the requirements of SFAS 146.

The effect of these items in 2003 was partially offset by the impact of a $25 million benefit from the vehicle leasing settlement during the
fourth quarter of 2003.

Noninterest expense for 2002 included the following:

•

$30 million of legal and consulting fees related to regulatory compliance and legal proceedings for matters arising in connection with regulatory agreements entered into in 2002 and
related matters, and

•

A $15 million adjustment related to incentive and retention arrangements in the form of co-investment partnerships for certain equity management employees.

Partially offsetting these items in 2002 was the benefit of a $19 million reduction in
reserves at PFPC that were originally established in 2001 largely related to a previously-reported plan to consolidate selected facilities.

Apart from the items described above, noninterest expense for 2003 increased from 2002 as costs related to reinvestment in new business initiatives and higher pension,
stock option, incentive compensation and marketing expenses more than offset a $100 million benefit from efficiency initiatives in 2003.

Loans

Loans were $36.3 billion at
December 31, 2003 compared with $35.5 billion at December 31, 2002. Apart from the impact of the consolidation of the Market Street conduit at December 31, 2003, loans declined $1.4 billion from the prior year. The decline was primarily due to
run-off in the residential mortgage and vehicle lease portfolios, and a decline in commercial loans, partially offset by an increase in home equity loans.

Securities

Total securities at December 31, 2003 were $15.7
billion compared with $13.8 billion at December 31, 2002. Securities represented 23% of total assets at December 31, 2003 compared with 21% at December 31, 2002.

At December 31, 2003, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized gain of $4 million, which represented the
difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2002 was a net unrealized gain of $274 million. The expected weighted-average life of securities available for sale was 2 years and 11 months at December 31,
2003 compared with 2 years and 9 months at December 31, 2002.

Securities
classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. All securities classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2002 were assets of companies formed in 2001 in transactions with AIG that were consolidated in PNC’s financial
statements. In January 2003, these securities were sold and these companies were liquidated. The expected weighted-average life of securities held to maturity was 2 years and 7 months at December 31, 2003 and 20 years and 2 months at December 31,
2002.

Loans Held For Sale

Loans held for sale totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2003, and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2002. The institutional lending held for sale portfolio declined $.2
billion during 2002 and was the primary reason for the decline in total loans held for sale.

Asset Quality

Nonperforming assets were $328 million at December 31, 2003, a decline of $90 million from the
prior year-end. The decline in nonperforming assets reflected the significant improvement in overall asset quality during 2003. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans, loans held for sale and foreclosed assets was .87% at December 31, 2003
compared with 1.13% at December 31, 2002. The allowance for loan and lease losses was $632 million and represented 1.74% of total loans and 238% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2003. The comparable amounts were $673 million, 1.90% and 218%,
respectively, at December 31, 2002.



Funding Sources

Total funding sources were $56.7 billion at December 31, 2003 and $54.1 billion at December 31, 2002, an increase of $2.6 billion.

Total borrowed funds increased $2.3 billion from December 31, 2002. The increase reflected the recognition of the following:

•

Commercial paper totaling $2.2 billion and other liabilities of certain VIEs due to our adoption of FIN 46,

•

The recognition of junior subordinated debentures totaling $1.2 billion at December 31, 2003, $300 million of which was issued in December 2003, in connection with the
deconsolidation of certain subsidiary trusts under FIN 46, and

•

$600 million of 5.25% Subordinated Notes due November 2015 that we issued in the fourth quarter of 2003.

The impact of these items was partially offset by bank notes, senior debt and subordinated debt maturities during 2003.

Shareholders’ Equity

Shareholders’ equity totaled $6.6 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 2002. The decline in shareholders’ equity compared
with the balance at December 31, 2002 reflected the impact of our repurchase of common stock during 2003 at a total cost of $508 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income that more than offset an increase in retained earnings
during this period.

Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2003 were 8.2%
for leverage, 9.5% for tier 1 risk-based and 13.8% for total risk-based capital. The regulatory capital ratios were 8.1% for leverage, 8.8% for tier 1 risk-based and 12.5% for total risk-based capital at December 31, 2002.

- Common shareholders’ equity
divided by total assets. Common shareholders’ equity equals total shareholders’ equity less preferred stock and the portion of capital surplus and retained interest related to the preferred stock.

Credit derivatives

- Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit
event of one or more referenced credits. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection buyer and protection seller at the inception of a transaction, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency and failure to meet payment
obligations when due. The buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of a credit event.

Custody assets

- All investment assets held on behalf of clients under safekeeping arrangements. We do not include these assets on
our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Investment assets held in custody at other institutions on our behalf are included in the appropriate asset categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as if physically held by us.

Derivatives

– Financial contracts whose value is derived from publicly traded
securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including forward contracts, futures, options and swaps.

Earning assets

– Assets that generate income, which include: short-term investments; loans held for sale; loans, net of unearned
income; securities; federal funds sold; resale agreements; and certain other assets.

Economic value of equity (“EVE”)

– The present value of the expected cash flows of our existing assets less the present value of the expected cash flows of our existing liabilities, plus the present value of the net
cash flows of our existing off-balance sheet positions.

Effective
duration

– A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on- and off- balance sheet positions.



Efficiency

- Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.

Foreign exchange contracts

- Contracts that provide for the future receipt and
delivery of foreign currency at previously agreed-upon terms.

Funds
transfer pricing

- A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of business segments. These assets and liabilities are assigned
funding rates that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures, using the least-cost funding sources available.

Futures and forward contracts

- Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial
instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument.

Institutional lending repositioning

- A 2001 PNC strategic action taken to build a more diverse and valuable business mix designed to create shareholder value over
time by reducing lending leverage and improving the risk/return characteristics of the banking business.

Interest rate floors and caps

- Interest rate protection instruments that involve payment from the seller to the buyer of an interest differential, which represents the difference between a short-term rate
(e.g., three-month LIBOR) and an agreed-upon rate (the strike rate) applied to a notional principal amount.

Interest rate swap contracts

- Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate
payments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on notional principal amounts.

Leverage ratio

- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by adjusted average total assets.

Net interest margin

- Annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets.

Nondiscretionary assets under administration

- Assets we hold for our
customers/clients in a nondiscretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Noninterest income to total revenue

- Total noninterest income divided by total revenue. Total revenue includes total noninterest income plus net interest income.

Nonperforming assets

- Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans,
troubled debt restructured loans, nonaccrual loans held for sale, foreclosed assets and other assets. Interest income does not accrue on assets classified as nonperforming.

Nonperforming loans

- Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, lease financing, consumer, commercial real estate and
residential mortgage customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include nonaccrual loans held for sale or foreclosed and other assets. Interest income does not accrue on loans classified as nonperforming.

Notional amount

- A number of currency units, shares, or other units
specified in a derivatives contract.

Recovery

- Cash proceeds received
on a loan that had previously been charged off. The amount received is credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses.

Return on capital

- Annualized net income divided by average capital.

Return on average assets

- Annualized net income divided by average assets.

Return on average common equity

- Annualized net income divided by average common shareholders’ equity.

Risk-weighted assets

- Primarily computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights
(as defined by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off-balance sheet instruments.

Securitization

- The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities.

Shareholders’ equity to total assets

- Period-end total shareholders’ equity divided by total period-end assets.

Tangible common capital ratio

- Common shareholders’ equity less
goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights) divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights).

Taxable-equivalent interest

- The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax.
As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. In order to provide accurate comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets is increased to
make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments.

Tier 1 risk-based capital

- Tier 1 capital equals: total shareholders’ equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain minority interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain intangible assets, less
equity investments in nonfinancial companies and less net unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on
available-for-sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders’ equity for tier 1 capital purposes.



Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio

- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.

Total fund assets serviced

- Total domestic and foreign fund investment
assets for which we provide related processing services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Total deposits

- The sum of total transaction deposits, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, other time deposits and deposits in foreign offices.

Total return swap

- A non-traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other
the “total return” of a defined underlying asset (e.g., loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the
counterparty. The counterparty is therefore assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset.

Total risk-based capital

- Tier 1 risk-based capital plus qualifying senior and subordinated debt, other minority interest not qualified as tier 1, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to
certain limitations.

Total risk-based capital ratio

- Total risk-based
capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.

Transaction
deposits

- The sum of money market and interest-bearing demand deposits and demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits.

Yield curve (shape of the yield curve, flat yield curve)

- A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the
same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a “normal” or “positive” yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A “flat” yield curve exists when yields are the same
for short-term and long-term bonds. A “steep” yield curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (“the Company”) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in “Internal Control-Integrated
Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

RESENTATION

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly owned, and certain partnership interests
and variable interest entities. We prepared these statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“generally accepted accounting principles” or “GAAP”). We have eliminated
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform with the 2004 presentation. These reclassifications did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or
results of operations.

Special Purpose Entities

Special purpose entities are broadly defined as legal entities structured for a particular purpose. We use special purpose entities in various legal forms to conduct
normal business activities. Special purpose entities that meet the criteria for a Qualifying Special Purpose Entity (“QSPE”) as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (“SFAS”) 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” are not required to be consolidated. We review special purpose entities that are not QSPEs for consolidation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”).

In general, a variable interest entity (“VIE”) is a special purpose entity formed as a corporation, partnership, limited liability corporation, or any other
legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either:

•

Does not have equity investors with voting rights that can directly or indirectly make decisions about the entity’s activities through those voting rights or similar rights, or

•

Has equity investors that do not provide enough cash or other financial resources for the entity to support its activities.

A VIE often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other
property.

We consolidate a VIE if we are considered to be the primary
beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE’s activities, is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns, or both. Upon consolidation of a VIE, we generally record all
of the VIE’s assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value, with future changes based upon consolidation accounting principles. See Note 2 Variable Interest Entities for more information about VIEs in which we hold a
significant interest but are not required to consolidate.

B

USINESS

C

OMBINATIONS

We record the net assets of companies that we acquire at their estimated fair
value at the date of acquisition and we include the results of operations of the acquired business in our consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition. We recognize as goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the estimated
fair value of the net assets acquired.

E

STIMATES

We prepare the consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time,
which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results will differ from these estimates and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.

ECOGNITION

We earn net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including:

•

Lending,

•

Securities portfolio,

•

Investment management and fund servicing,

•

Customer deposits,

•

Loan servicing,

•

Brokerage services, and

•

Securities and derivatives trading activities including foreign exchange.

We also earn revenue from selling loans and securities, and we recognize income or loss from certain private equity activities. We also earn fees and commissions from:

•

Issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees,

•

Selling various insurance products,

•

Providing treasury management services, and

•

Participating in certain capital markets transactions.



We recognize revenue from loan servicing, securities and derivatives and foreign exchange trading, and securities
underwriting activities as they are earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur or as services are provided. Revenue earned on interest-earning assets is recognized based on the effective yield of the financial instrument. Service
charges on deposit accounts are recognized as charged. Brokerage fees and gains on the sale of securities and certain derivatives are recognized on a trade-date basis.

We recognize asset management and fund servicing fees primarily as the services are performed. Asset management fees are primarily based on
a percentage of the fair value of the assets under management and performance fees are primarily based on a percentage of the returns on such assets. Fund servicing fees are primarily based on a percentage of the fair value of the fund assets and
the number of shareholder accounts we service.

We recognize revenue from the
sale of loans upon closing of the transaction. We record private equity income or loss based on changes in the valuation of the underlying investments or when we dispose of our interest.

In certain circumstances, revenue is reported net of associated expenses in accordance with applicable accounting guidance and industry
practice.

I

NVESTMENTS

We have interests in various types of investments. The accounting for these investments is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, items such as:

•

Marketability of the investment,

•

Ownership interest,

•

Our plans for the investment, and

•

The nature of the investment.

Private Equity Investments

We report private equity
investments, which include direct investments in companies, interests in limited partnerships, and general partnership interests, at estimated fair values. These estimates are based upon available information and may not necessarily represent
amounts that we will ultimately realize through distribution, sale or liquidation of the investments. The valuation procedures applied to direct investments include techniques such as multiples of cash flow of the entity, independent appraisals of
the entity or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. We value general partnership interests based on the underlying investments of the partnership using procedures consistent with those applied to direct investments.
We generally value limited partnership investments based on the financial statements we receive from the general partner. We include all private equity investments in the consolidated balance sheet in other assets. Changes in the fair value of these
assets are recognized in noninterest income.

We consolidate private equity
investments when we are the sole general partner in a limited partnership and have determined that we have control of the partnership.

Equity Securities and Partnership Interests

We account for
equity investments other than private equity investments under one of the following methods:

•

Marketable equity securities are recorded on a trade-date basis and are accounted for at fair value based on the securities’ quoted market prices from a national securities
exchange. Those purchased with the intention of recognizing short-term profits are placed in the trading account, carried at market value and classified as short-term investments. Gains and losses on trading securities are included in noninterest
income. Marketable equity securities not classified as trading are designated as securities available for sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income
or loss. Any unrealized losses that we have determined to be other than temporary are recognized in the period that the determination is made.

•

Investments in nonmarketable equity securities are recorded using the cost or equity method of accounting. The cost method is used for those investments in which we do not have
significant influence over the investee. Under this method, there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value. If the decline is determined to be other than temporary, we write down the cost basis of the
investment to a new cost basis that represents realizable value. The amount of the write-down is accounted for as a loss included in noninterest income in the period the determination is made. Distributions received from income on cost method
investments are included in noninterest income. We use the equity method for those investments in which we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Under the equity method, we record our equity ownership share of the net
income or loss of the investee in noninterest income. We include nonmarketable equity securities in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.

For investments in limited partnerships that are not required to be consolidated, we use either the cost method or the equity method as
described above for nonmarketable equity securities. We use the equity method if our limited partner ownership interest in the partnership is greater than 3%. We use the cost method for the remaining limited partnership investments. We account for
general partnership interests under the equity method when we have determined that we do not have control over these entities and are not required to consolidate them. General and limited partnership investments are included in other assets in the
consolidated balance sheet.



Debt Securities

Debt securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. We classify debt securities as securities and carry them at amortized cost if we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Debt securities that we purchase
for short-term appreciation or other trading purposes are carried at market value and classified as short-term investments. Gains and losses on these securities are included in noninterest income. Debt securities not classified as held to maturity
or trading are designated as securities available for sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Other-than-temporary declines in the fair value
of available for sale debt securities are recognized as a security loss included in noninterest income in the period in which the determination is made. We review for impairment all debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position on a
quarterly basis.

We include all interest on debt securities, including
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the interest method, in interest income. We compute gains and losses realized on the sale of debt securities available for sale on a specific security basis and include them in noninterest
income.

We designate as held for sale loans and related loan
commitments when we have a positive intent to sell them. We transfer loans and commitments to the loans held for sale category at the lower of cost or fair market value. At the time of transfer, related write-downs on the loans and commitments are
recorded as charge-offs or as a separate liability, respectively. We establish a new cost basis and we recognize any subsequent lower of cost or market adjustment as a valuation allowance with changes included in noninterest income. Gains or losses
on the sale of these loans are also included in noninterest income.

We apply
the lower of cost or market analysis on pools of homogeneous loans and commitments on a net aggregate basis. For non-homogeneous loans and commitments, we do this analysis on an individual loan and commitment basis.

Interest income with respect to loans held for sale other than those in nonaccrual status is
accrued based on the principal amount outstanding.

In certain circumstances,
loans and commitments designated as held for sale may be later transferred back to the loan portfolio based on our intent to retain the credit exposure. We transfer these loans and commitments to portfolio at the lower of cost or market value.

EASES

Loans are stated at the principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned income and premium or discount on loans purchased. Interest income related
to loans other than nonaccrual loans is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and credited to interest income as earned using the interest method. Significant loan fees are deferred and accreted to interest income over the respective
lives of the loans. Loan origination costs are not deferred and are included in noninterest expense. The net impact of this practice compared with full accrual of fees and amortization of costs is not material to our consolidated results of
operations.

We also provide financing for various types of equipment,
aircraft, energy and power systems, and rolling stock through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income.
Leveraged leases, a form of financing lease, are carried net of nonrecourse debt. We recognize income over the term of the lease using methods that approximate the level yield method. Lease residual values are reviewed for other-than-temporary
impairment on at least an annual basis. Gains or losses on the sale of leased assets are included in other noninterest income while valuation adjustments on lease residuals are included in other noninterest expense.

NTERESTS

We recognize the sale of loans or other financial assets
when the transferred assets are legally isolated from our creditors and the appropriate accounting criteria are met. We also sell mortgage and other loans through secondary market securitizations. In certain cases, we may retain a portion or all of
the securities issued, interest-only strips, one or more subordinated tranches, servicing rights and, in some cases, cash reserve accounts, all of which are considered retained interests in the transferred assets. Our loan sales and securitizations
are generally structured without recourse to us and with no restrictions on the retained interests. In the event we are obligated for recourse liabilities in a sale, our policy is to record such liabilities at fair value upon closing of the
transaction. Gains or losses recognized on the sale of the loans depend on the allocation of carrying value between the loans sold and the retained interests, based on their relative fair market values at the date of sale. We generally estimate fair
value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using assumptions as to discount rates, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit losses and servicing costs, if applicable. Gains or losses on these transactions are reported in
noninterest income.

Servicing rights retained are carried at the lower of
carrying value or fair market value and are amortized over their estimated lives in proportion to estimated net servicing income.

Each quarter, we evaluate our servicing assets for impairment by categorizing the pools of assets underlying servicing rights by product type. A valuation allowance is
recorded and reduces current income when the carrying amount of a specific asset category exceeds its fair value.

We classify other securities retained as debt securities available for sale or other assets, depending on the form of the retained interest. Retained interests that are
subject to prepayment risk are reviewed on a quarterly basis for impairment. If the fair value of the retained interest is below its carrying amount and the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, then the decline is reflected in earnings.
We recognize other adjustments to the fair market value of retained interests through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.

ONPERFORMING

A

SSETS

Nonperforming assets include:

•

Nonaccrual loans,

•

Troubled debt restructurings,

•

Nonaccrual loans held for sale, and

•

Foreclosed assets.

Other than consumer loans, we generally classify loans and loans held for sale as nonaccrual when we determine that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful or when a default of interest or principal has
existed for 90 days or more, unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection. When interest accrual is discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and unpaid interest accrued
in the prior year, if any, is charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. We classify home equity loans as nonaccrual at 120 days past due and home equity lines of credit as nonaccrual at 180 days past due and record them at the lower
of cost or market value, less liquidation costs, unless the loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans well-secured by residential real estate, including home equity and home equity lines of credit, are classified as nonaccrual
at 12 months past due. We charge-off loans other than consumer loans based on the facts and circumstances of the individual loan. Consumer loans that are not well-secured or in the process of collection are generally charged-off in the month they
become 120 days past due.

A loan is categorized as a troubled debt
restructuring in the period of restructuring if a significant concession is granted due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower.

Nonperforming loans are generally not returned to performing status until the obligation is brought current and the borrower has performed in accordance with the
contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and collection of the contractual principal and interest is no longer doubtful.

Nonaccrual commercial and commercial real estate loans and troubled debt restructurings are designated as impaired loans. We recognize interest collected on these loans

Foreclosed assets are comprised of
any asset seized or property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. These assets are recorded on the date acquired at the lower of the related loan balance or market value of the collateral less
estimated disposition costs. We estimate market values primarily based on appraisals when available or quoted market prices on liquid assets. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are valued at the lower of the amount recorded at acquisition date or the
current market value less estimated disposition costs. Valuation adjustments on these assets and gains or losses realized from disposition of such property are reflected in noninterest expense.

We maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that we believe to be adequate to absorb
estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses, which is charged against operating results, and decreased by the amount of charge-offs, net of recoveries. Our
determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the credit portfolio and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including, among others:

•

Expected default probabilities,

•

Loss given default,

•

Exposure at default,

•

Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans,

•

Value of collateral,

•

Estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and

•

General amounts for historical loss experience, economic conditions, potential estimation or judgmental errors, losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios, all of
which may be susceptible to significant change.

In determining
the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, we make specific allocations to impaired loans, to pools of watchlist and nonwatchlist loans and to consumer and residential mortgage loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for
probable losses not covered in specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies related to qualitative and measurement factors. While allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all credit losses.

Specific allocations are made to significant impaired loans and are determined
in accordance with SFAS 114, “Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,” with impairment measured generally based on the present value of the loan’s expected cash flows, the loan’s observable market price or the fair
value of the loan’s collateral. We establish a minimum specific allowance on all impaired loans at the applicable pool reserve allocation rate for similar loans.

Allocations to loan pools are developed by business segment and risk rating and are based on historical loss trends and our judgment
concerning those trends and other relevant factors. These factors may include, among others:

•

Actual versus estimated losses,

•

Regional and national economic conditions,

•

Business segment and portfolio concentrations,

•

Industry competition and consolidation, and

•

The impact of government regulations.

Loss factors are based on industry and/or internal experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that, based on our judgment, impact the collectibility of the
portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Consumer and residential mortgage loan allocations are made at a total portfolio level based on historical loss experience adjusted for portfolio activity and economic conditions.



While our pool reserve methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors, there continues to be a certain element of
uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential estimation or judgmental errors. We provide additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for expected losses attributable to such risks. In addition, these incremental reserves
also include factors which may not be directly measured in the determination of specific or pooled reserves. These factors include:

•

General economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas,

•

Credit quality trends,

•

Recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio,

•

Duration of the current economic cycle, and

•

Bank regulatory examination results.

We provide servicing under various commercial loan servicing contracts.
These contracts are either purchased in the market place or retained as part of a commercial mortgage loan securitization or loan sale. If a contract is purchased, it is recorded at cost. If a contract is retained, the servicing right is recorded
based on its relative fair value to all of the assets securitized or sold. Fair value is based on the present value of the expected future cash flows, including assumptions as to:

•

Interest rates for escrow and deposit balance earnings,

•

Discount rates,

•

Estimated prepayment speeds, and

•

Estimated servicing costs.

We record the asset as an other intangible asset and amortize it over its estimated life in proportion to estimated net servicing income. On a quarterly basis, we test the asset for impairment. If the estimated fair
value of the asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. Servicing fees are recognized as they are earned and are reported net of amortization expense in noninterest income.

CTIVITIES

We use a
variety of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process to manage interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We use substantially all such instruments to manage risk related
to changes in interest rates. Interest rate and total return



swaps, interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest rate risk management.

Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. We
manage these risks as part of our asset and liability management process and through credit policies and procedures. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk by entering into transactions with only high-quality institutions, establishing credit
limits, and generally requiring bilateral netting and collateral agreements.

We recognize all derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities in other assets or other liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated
and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. For derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in other noninterest income.

For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we must designate the hedging instrument, based on
the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. We have no derivatives that hedge the net investment in a foreign operation.

We formally document the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as
well as the risk management objective and strategy before undertaking a hedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivatives and related hedged items must be designated as a hedge. For hedging relationships in which effectiveness is measured, we
formally assess, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, if the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not
highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued.

For derivatives
that are designated as fair value hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability attributable to a particular risk), changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative are recognized in earnings and
offset by recognizing changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. To the extent the hedge is ineffective, the changes in fair value will not offset and the difference is reflected in the same financial
statement category as the hedged item.

For derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows), the effective portions of the gain or loss on derivatives are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified in
interest income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The change in fair value of any ineffective portion of the hedging derivative is recognized immediately in earnings.

We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no
longer an effective hedge; the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; or the derivative is de-designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge or it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the
originally specified time period. If we determine that the derivative no longer qualifies as a fair value or cash flow hedge and therefore hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will continue to be recorded on the balance sheet at its fair
value with changes in fair value included in current earnings. For a discontinued fair value hedge, the previously hedged item is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the derivative will continue to
be recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in current earnings, and the gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately into earnings. When we discontinue hedge
accounting because the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or no longer designated, the amount reported in other comprehensive income up to the date of sale, termination or de-designation continues to be reported in other comprehensive income
until the forecasted transaction affects earnings.

We did not terminate any
cash flow hedges in 2004, 2003 or 2002 due to a determination that a forecasted transaction was no longer likely to occur.

We occasionally purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative. At the inception of the financial instrument we assess if economic
characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument (host contract), whether the financial instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative and the host contract
is measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative. If the embedded derivative does not meet these
three conditions, the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument and be recorded apart from the host contract and carried at fair value with changes recorded in current earnings.

We enter into commitments to make loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is set prior to
funding (interest rate lock commitments). We also enter into commitments to purchase mortgage loans (purchase commitments). Both interest rate lock commitments and purchase commitments on mortgage loans that will be held for resale are accounted for
as free-standing derivatives. Interest rate lock commitments and purchase commitments that are considered to be derivatives are recorded at fair value in other assets or other liabilities. Fair value of interest rate lock commitments and purchase
commitments is determined as the change in value that occurs after the inception of the commitment considering the projected security price, fees collected from the borrower and costs to originate, adjusted for anticipated fallout. We recognize the
gain or loss from the change in fair value of these derivatives in other noninterest income.

We calculate basic earnings per common share by dividing net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends declared by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding.

Diluted earnings per common share is based on net income available to common stockholders. We
increase the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding by the assumed conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock and debentures from the beginning of the year or date of issuance, if later, and the number of shares of
common stock that would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options and the issuance of incentive shares. These adjustments to the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding are made only when we expect such adjustments to
dilute earnings per common share.

OMPENSATION

Our stock-based employee compensation plans are described in
Note 22 Stock-Based Compensation Plans.

Prior to January 2003, we accounted
for employee stock-based compensation plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” (“APB 25”) and related guidance. We did not recognize stock-based
employee compensation expense related to stock options prior to 2003 as all options to purchase our stock or our subsidiaries’ stock granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date
of grant. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -Transition and
Disclosure,” prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003. We did not restate results for prior years. Since we adopted SFAS 123 prospectively, the cost related to stock-based employee compensation
included in income from continuing operations for 2004 and 2003 is less than what we would have recognized if we had applied the fair value based method to all awards since the original effective date of the standard.

The following table shows the effect on income from continuing operations and basic and
diluted earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, as amended, to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period.

Pro Forma Income From Continuing Operations And Earnings Per Share

As discussed in Note 22 Stock-Based
Compensation Plans, a pretax credit of $1 million was recognized in compensation expense in 2002 for incentive share and restricted stock awards. The net credit was due to forfeitures and adjustments of accruals related to performance-based awards
under PNC’s incentive plans.

RONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
(“SFAS 123R”). SFAS 123R replaces SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value. We will adopt SFAS 123R effective July 1,
2005 using the modified prospective method of transition. This method requires SFAS 123R to be applied to new awards and awards modified, repurchased or cancelled after the effective date. Additionally, compensation expense attributable to any
unvested awards outstanding at the date of adoption must be recognized over the remaining requisite service period. As we previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on January 1, 2003, we do not expect the adoption of SFAS
123R to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provisions within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” The American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004 (the “2004 Act”) was signed into law in October 2004 and provides a one-time dividends-received deduction on the repatriation of qualifying foreign earnings. While SFAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” (“SFAS
109”) requires the



effect of changes in tax law to be recognized in the period that the change is enacted, FSP 109-2 provides entities additional time beyond the reporting
period that includes the enactment date to assess the effect of the 2004 Act on its plans for repatriation of foreign earnings. We are currently evaluating the effect of this provision of the 2004 Act. See Note 24 Income Taxes for disclosures
required by FSP 109-2.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153,
“Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions

.” SFAS 153 amends the APB 29 exception to fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges to apply only to those
exchanges which lack commercial substance, as defined in the standard. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges that we enter into on or after July 1, 2005. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In July 2004, the Emerging Issues Task
Force (“EITF”) issued EITF 02-14, “Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock if the Investor Has the Ability to Exercise Significant Influence over the Operating and
Financial Policies of the Investee.” EITF 02-14 was effective for reporting periods beginning after September 15, 2004 and requires the use of the equity method of accounting for investments that are in-substance common stock when the investor
has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee. The application of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003.” FSP 106-2 provides guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy and other provisions of The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. We adopted FSP 106-2 in the third quarter of
2004. See Note 21 Employee Benefit Plans for additional information.

In March
2004, the EITF supplemented EITF 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.” EITF 03-1 provides guidance for evaluating whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired and
requires disclosures about unrealized losses on available for sale debt and equity securities. In September 2004, the FASB issued FSP EITF Issue 03-1-1, “Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue 03-1,” which deferred the effective
date of the recognition and measurement provisions of the consensus until further guidance is issued. See Note 9 Securities and Note 27 Fair Value Of Financial Instruments for the disclosures required by EITF 03-1. The impact on future earnings, if
any, of the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 will not be known until the FASB issues its guidance. At December 31, 2004, the total unrealized losses in the securities available for sale portfolio was $125 million compared with
total unrealized losses of $122 million at December 31, 2003.

In December
2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03-3, “Accounting for Loans and Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer” (“SOP 03-3”). SOP 03-3 addresses accounting for differences between
contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences relate, at least in part, to a deterioration of credit quality. SOP 03-3 prohibits
companies from carrying over valuation allowances in the initial accounting for such loans and limits the yield that may be accreted to the excess of undiscounted expected cash flows over the initial investment in the loan. Decreases in expected
cash flows are recognized as impairment and increases are recognized prospectively through an adjustment of the loan yield. SOP 03-3 is effective for loans and debt securities acquired by PNC on or after January 1, 2005. We do not expect adoption of
this guidance to have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” In November 2003, the FASB issued FSP 150-3, “Effective Date,
Disclosures, and Transition for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests under FASB Statement No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.

” FSP 150-3 deferred indefinitely the classification and measurement provisions of SFAS 150 for certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests, including interests that are redeemed
only upon the liquidation of a limited-life subsidiary. The mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests in these entities, which for PNC represent noncontrolling interests in affordable housing partnerships, are included in the consolidated
balance sheet under the caption, “Minority and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities.” Generally, on the date these VIEs are terminated, the liquidation value of the noncontrolling interests would equal the residual value of
the net assets of the respective entity at that date. The distribution of that liquidation value to the noncontrolling interest holders would generally be in proportion to their respective interests. Liquidation and settlement of these
noncontrolling interests at December 31, 2004 would have resulted in payments of approximately $241 million based on the terms of the respective entities’ governing documents and the measurement principles included in SFAS 150.

Certain equity investments are made by us in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit pursuant to Section 42
of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the
Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are
funded through a combination of debt and equity, with equity typically comprising 30% to 60% of the total project capital. We own a majority of the limited partnership interests in these entities. We also consolidated certain entities in which we,
as a national syndicator of affordable housing equity, serve as the general partner (together with the aforementioned limited partnership investments, the “LIHTC investments”), and no other entity owns a majority of the limited partnership
interests. In these syndication transactions, we create funds in which our subsidiary is the general partner and sells limited partnership interests to third parties, and in some cases may also purchase a limited partnership interest in the fund.
The fund’s limited partners can generally remove the general partner without cause at any time. The purpose of this business is to generate income from the syndication of these funds and to generate servicing fees by managing the funds. General
partner activities include selecting, evaluating, structuring, negotiating, and closing the fund investments in operating limited partnerships, as well as oversight of the ongoing operations of the fund portfolio. The assets are primarily included
in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Neither creditors nor equity investors in the LIHTC investments have any recourse to our general credit.

The consolidation of Market Street and the LIHTC investments is reflected in the Wholesale Banking business segment.

The access to and cost of funding new
business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution’s capital strength. The minimum
regulatory capital ratios are 4% for tier 1 risk-based, 8% for total risk-based and 3% for leverage. However, regulators may require higher capital levels when particular circumstances warrant. To qualify as “well capitalized,” regulators
require banks to maintain capital ratios of at least 6% for tier 1 risk-based, 10% for total risk-based and 5% for leverage. At December 31, 2004, each of our bank subsidiaries met the “well capitalized” capital ratio requirements. We
believe our bank subsidiaries will continue to meet these requirements in 2005.

Capital needs,

•

Laws and regulations,

•

Corporate policies,

•

Contractual restrictions, and

•

Other factors.

Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank,
N.A. without prior regulatory approval was approximately $995 million at December 31, 2004.

In 2004, PNC Bank, N.A., received regulatory approval to reduce its capital though the in-kind transfer of its ownership interest in BlackRock to PNC Bank, N.A.’s direct parent, PNC Bancorp, Inc. This transfer
was completed in January 2005 and resulted in a reduction in regulatory capital for PNC Bank, N.A. of approximately $500 million. PNC Bank, N.A.’s capital was replenished in January 2005 by its $500 million issuance of preferred stock, on an
intercompany basis, to the top tier parent company of PNC.

Under federal law,
bank subsidiaries generally may not extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries on terms and under circumstances that are not substantially the same as comparable extensions of credit to nonaffiliates. No extension of credit may
be made to the parent company or a non-bank subsidiary which is in excess of 10% of the capital stock and surplus of such bank subsidiary or in excess of 20% of the capital and surplus of such bank subsidiary as to aggregate extensions of credit to
the parent company and its non-bank subsidiaries. Such extensions of credit, with limited exceptions, must be fully collateralized by certain specified assets. In certain circumstances, federal regulatory authorities may impose more restrictive
limitations.

Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions
to maintain cash reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”). During 2004, subsidiary banks maintained reserves which averaged $131 million.

On June 2, 2003, PNC ICLC Corp. (“PNCICLC”), an indirect non-bank subsidiary of PNC, entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the “Deferred
Prosecution Agreement”) with the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the “Department of Justice”) relating to PNCICLC’s actions in connection with the PAGIC transactions that were entered into
in 2001. In accordance with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, PNCICLC paid a $25 million monetary penalty to the government and established a $90 million restitution fund to satisfy claims, including for the settlement of pending
shareholder securities litigation, stemming from the PAGIC transactions. PNC recognized a pretax charge to earnings of $120 million in the second quarter of 2003 reflecting the Deferred Prosecution Agreement and related legal and consulting costs.
Pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the Department of Justice sought dismissal of the complaint against PNCICLC with prejudice, as PNCICLC had complied with all of the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. On June 23,
2004, the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania granted the Department of Justice’s motion seeking dismissal with prejudice of the criminal complaint. These actions brought the Deferred Prosecution Agreement to a
conclusion.

ROCEEDINGS

There are several pending judicial or administrative proceedings or other matters arising out of the three 2001 PAGIC
transactions. These pending proceedings or other matters are described below. Among the requirements of the June 2003 Deferred Prosecution Agreement relating to the PAGIC transactions was the establishment of a Restitution Fund through our $90
million contribution. The Restitution Fund will be available to satisfy claims, including for the settlement of the pending securities litigation referred to below. Louis W. Fryman, chairman of Fox Rothschild LLP in



Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is administering the Restitution Fund.

In December 2004 and January 2005, we entered into settlement agreements relating to certain of the lawsuits and other claims arising out of the PAGIC transactions.
These settlements are described below, following a description of each of these pending proceedings and other matters.

The several putative class action complaints filed during 2002 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania arising out of the PAGIC
transactions have been consolidated in a consolidated class action complaint brought on behalf of purchasers of our common stock between July 19, 2001 and July 18, 2002 (the “Class Period”). The consolidated class action complaint names
PNC, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer, our Controller, and our independent auditors for 2001 as defendants and seeks unquantified damages, interest, attorneys’ fees and other expenses. The
consolidated class action complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws related to disclosures regarding the PAGIC transactions and related matters.

In August 2002, the United States Department of Labor began a formal investigation of the Administrative Committee of our Incentive Savings Plan (“Plan”) in
connection with the Administrative Committee’s conduct relating to our common stock held by the Plan. Both the Administrative Committee and PNC are cooperating fully with the investigation. In June 2003, the Administrative Committee retained
Independent Fiduciary Services, Inc. (“IFS”) to serve as an independent fiduciary charged with the exclusive authority and responsibility to act on behalf of the Plan in connection with the pending securities litigation referred to above
and to evaluate any legal rights the Plan might have against any parties relating to the PAGIC transactions. This authority includes representing the Plan’s interests in connection with the Restitution Fund set up under the Deferred Prosecution
Agreement. The Department of Labor has communicated with IFS in connection with the engagement.

We received a letter in June 2003 on behalf of an alleged shareholder demanding that we take appropriate legal action against our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer, and our
Controller, as well as any other individuals or entities allegedly responsible for causing damage to PNC as a result of the PAGIC transactions. The Board referred this matter to a special committee of the Board for evaluation. The special committee
has completed its evaluation and reported its findings to the Board of Directors and to counsel for the alleged shareholder. The special committee recommended against bringing any claims against our current or former executive officers but made
certain recommendations with respect to resolution of potential claims we have with respect to certain other third parties.

In July 2003, the lead underwriter on our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage filed a lawsuit for a declaratory judgment against PNC and PNC ICLC in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The complaint seeks a determination that the defendants breached the terms and conditions of the policy and, as a result, the policy does not provide coverage for any loss relating to
or arising out of the Department of Justice investigation or the PAGIC transactions. Alternatively, the complaint seeks a determination that the policy does not provide coverage for the payments made pursuant to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement.
The complaint also seeks attorneys’ fees and costs. In July 2004, the court granted our motion to stay the action until resolution of the claims against PNC in the pending securities litigation described above.

On December 17, 2004, we entered into a tentative settlement of the consolidated putative
class actions, reflected in a Memorandum of Understanding between the plaintiffs and PNC, our former and current executive officers who are defendants in the lawsuit, and AIG Financial Products Corp.

The tentative settlement is subject to completion of final documentation, court approval and
other conditions, including some that are outside the control of the parties.

At the same time, we settled all claims between us, on the one hand, and AIG Financial Products and its affiliate, American International Surplus Lines Insurance Company (“AISLIC”), on the other hand, related to the PAGIC
transactions. AIG Financial Products was our counterparty in the PAGIC transactions, and AISLIC is one of the insurers under our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage. Subsequently, we settled claims against one of the other insurers under our
Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage.

The following are the key elements
of these settlements:

•

Payments into Settlement Fund

. The insurers under our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage will pay $30 million into a Settlement Fund for the benefit of the class. AIG
Financial Products will pay $4 million into the Settlement Fund to settle potential claims by the plaintiffs against it.

The plaintiffs have been in contact with Mr. Fryman, the administrator of the Restitution Fund, and intend to coordinate the administration and distribution of the Settlement Fund
with the distribution of the Restitution Fund.

Neither PNC nor any of our current or former officers, directors or employees will be required to contribute any funds to this settlement.

•

Assignment of Claims

. We are assigning to the plaintiffs claims we may have against the non-settling defendant in this lawsuit and all other unaffiliated third parties (other
than AIG Financial Products and its predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and their respective directors, officers and employees (collectively, “AIG”)) relating to the subject matter of the lawsuit.

•

Pending Insurance Claim

. At the time of the Memorandum of Understanding, we settled our claim against AISLIC related to our contribution of $90 million to
the Restitution Fund for $11.25 million, which represents a portion of AISLIC’s share of our overall claim. In January 2005, we settled with another insurer for an aggregate payment to us of $4.5 million, which represents a portion of their
share of our overall claim. We will be preserving our claim against our insurers with whom we have not settled



with respect to, among other things, any amounts disbursed out of the Restitution Fund.

•

Other AIG Claims

. We and AIG Financial Products settled all other claims between us arising out of the PAGIC transactions for a payment from us of $2 million.

•

Other Claims

. In connection with the settlement of the lawsuit, the claims of IFS on behalf of our Incentive Savings Plan and its participants will be resolved and the class
covered by the settlement will be expanded to include participants in the Plan. The Department of Labor is not, however, a party to this settlement and thus the settlement does not necessarily resolve its investigation.

•

In addition, the settlement of this lawsuit will resolve the derivative claims asserted by one of our putative shareholders and any other derivative demands that may be filed in
connection with the PAGIC transactions.

•

Releases

. We will be releasing the insurers providing our Executive Blended Risk insurance coverage from any further liability to PNC arising out of the events that gave rise
to the lawsuit, except for the claims against these insurers (other than those with whom we have settled) relating to the $90 million payment to the Restitution Fund.

•

PNC and AIG are releasing each other with respect to all claims between us arising out of the PAGIC transactions.

We will be responsible for the costs of administering the settlement and the Restitution Fund
and may incur additional costs in the future in connection with the advancement of expenses and/or indemnification obligations related to the subject matter of this lawsuit. We do not expect such costs to be material. The net payment from AIG was
recognized in our income statement in the fourth quarter of 2004, while the payments from the other insurer with whom we have settled will be recognized in the first quarter of 2005.

Some of our subsidiaries are defendants (or have potential contractual contribution obligations to other defendants) in several pending
lawsuits brought during late 2002 and 2003 arising out of the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications Corporation. There also are threatened additional proceedings arising out of the same matters. One of the lawsuits is pending in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York and has been brought on Adelphia’s behalf as an adversary proceeding by the unsecured creditors’ committee in Adelphia’s bankruptcy proceeding. A motion to intervene on behalf of
the equity committee is also pending in this case. The other lawsuits (one of which is a putative consolidated class action) have been brought by holders of debt and equity securities of Adelphia and have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. These lawsuits arise out of lending and securities underwriting activities engaged in by these PNC subsidiaries together with other financial services companies. In the
aggregate, more than 400 other financial services companies and numerous other companies and individuals have been named as defendants in one or more of the lawsuits. Collectively, with respect to some or all of the defendants, the lawsuits allege
violations of federal securities laws, violations of common law duties, aiding and abetting such violations, voidable preference payments, and fraudulent transfers, among other matters. The lawsuits seek unquantified monetary damages, interest,
attorneys’ fees and other expenses, and a return of the alleged voidable preference and fraudulent transfer payments, among other remedies. We believe that we have substantial defenses to the claims against us in these lawsuits and intend to
defend them vigorously. These lawsuits are currently in initial stages and present complex issues of law and fact. As a result, we are not currently capable of evaluating our exposure, if any, resulting from these lawsuits.

On December 30, 2004, a putative class action was filed against PNC; PNC Bank, N.A.; our
Pension Plan and its Pension Committee in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint claims violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), arising out
of the January 1, 1999 conversion of our Pension Plan from a traditional defined benefit formula to a “cash balance” defined benefit formula, and the design and continued operation of the Plan. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all
current and former employee-participants in and beneficiaries of the Plan on December 31, 1998 and on or after January 1, 1999. The plaintiffs are seeking damages and equitable relief available under ERISA, including interest, costs, and
attorneys’ fees. We believe that we have substantial defenses to the claims against us in this lawsuit and intend to defend it vigorously.

In connection with industry-wide investigations of practices in the mutual fund industry including market timing, late day trading, employee trading in mutual funds and
other matters, several of our subsidiaries have received requests for information and other inquiries from state and federal governmental and regulatory authorities. These subsidiaries are fully cooperating in all of these matters.

In addition to the proceedings or other matters described above, PNC and persons to whom we
may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. Management does not anticipate, at the
present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us,
whether in the proceedings or other matters specifically described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period.

In January 2003, we agreed to a settlement with Washington Mutual Bank, FA of all issues in dispute between us in connection with the 2001 sale of our residential
mortgage banking business to Washington Mutual. The settlement was reported in our fourth quarter 2002 results as a $16 million net loss in discontinued operations. The results of the discontinued residential mortgage banking business are presented
on one line in the Consolidated Statement Of Income.

There was no other income

Securities represented 21% of total assets at December 31, 2004 compared with 23% at December 31, 2003 and 21% at
December 31, 2002.

At December 31, 2004, the securities available for sale
balance included a net unrealized loss of $102 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 were net unrealized gains of $4 million and $274
million, respectively. The impact on bond prices of increases in interest rates during 2004 was reflected in the net unrealized loss position at December 31, 2004.

The fair value of securities available for sale decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. Further increases in interest rates
after December 31, 2004, if sustained, will adversely impact the fair value of securities available for sale going forward compared with the fair value at December 31, 2004. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale
portfolio are included in shareholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax.

The expected weighted-average life of securities available for sale was 2 years and 8 months at December 31, 2004, 2 years and 11 months at December 31, 2003 and 2 years
and 9 months at December 31, 2002.

We carry securities classified as held to
maturity at amortized cost. Securities classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 were related to Market Street and were consolidated due to our adoption of FIN 46 effective July 1, 2003. These securities represent a
static pool of lottery payments purchased as a private placement. Securities classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2002 were owned by companies formed with AIG that were consolidated in PNC’s financial statements. In January 2003,
these securities were sold and these companies were liquidated. The expected weighted-average life of securities held to maturity was 7 months at December 31, 2004, 2 years and 7 months at December 31, 2003 and 20 years and 2 months at December 31,
2002.

The following table presents unrealized loss and fair value of
securities at December 31, 2004 for which an other-than-temporary impairment has not been recognized. These securities are segregated between investments that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and greater
than twelve months.

We do not believe any individual
unrealized loss as of December 31, 2004 represents an other-than-temporary impairment. The $82 million unrealized losses reported for mortgage-backed securities relate primarily to securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and private institutions. The $15 million unrealized losses reported for commercial mortgage-backed securities relate primarily to fixed rate securities. The $14 million unrealized losses associated with
asset-backed securities relate primarily to securities collateralized by home equity, automobile and credit card loans. The $13 million unrealized losses reported for U.S. Treasuries and government agencies were primarily related to agency debenture
securities. The majority of the unrealized losses associated with both mortgage and asset-backed securities are attributable to changes in interest rates and not from the deterioration of the credit quality of the issuer.

Net securities gains were $55 million in 2004 compared with $116 million in 2003 and $89
million in 2002. Net securities gains for 2003 included $25 million of gains related to the liquidation of the entities formed in 2001 in connection with the PAGIC transactions.

The carrying value of securities
pledged to secure public and trust deposits and repurchase agreements and for other purposes was $8.1 billion at December 31, 2004 and $6.7 billion at December 31, 2003. The fair value of securities accepted as collateral that we are permitted by
contract or custom to sell or repledge was $1.7 billion at December 31, 2004. Of this amount, $.6 billion was repledged to others.

(a)

Weighted average yield is zero due to the security being classified as a nonoperating asset.

Based on current interest rates and expected prepayment speeds, the total weighted-average expected maturity of mortgage-backed securities
was 2 years and 8 months, of commercial mortgage-backed securities was 4 years and 7 months and of asset-backed securities was 1 year and 11 months at December 31, 2004. Weighted-average yields are based on historical cost with effective yields

Loans outstanding were as follows:

Loans outstanding and related unfunded
commitments are concentrated in our primary geographic markets. At December 31, 2004, no specific industry concentration exceeded 4.5% of total commercial loans outstanding and unfunded commitments.

Total loans, net of unearned income, at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 included $2.3
billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, related to Market Street.

We realized
net gains from sales of commercial mortgages of $50 million in 2004, $52 million in 2003 and $31 million in 2002. Net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to the liquidation of our institutional loans held for sale totaled $52 million in
2004, $69 million in 2003 and $147 million in 2002. Gains on sales of education loans totaled $30 million in 2004, $20 million in 2003 and $23 million in 2002.

Net Unfunded Credit Commitments

Commitments to extend credit represent
arrangements to lend funds subject to specified contractual conditions. At December 31, 2004, commercial commitments are reported net of $6.7 billion of participations, assignments and syndications, primarily to financial services companies. The
comparable amount was $6.4 billion at December 31, 2003. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, may require payment of a fee, and contain termination clauses in the event the customer’s credit quality deteriorates. Based on our
historical experience, most commitments expire unfunded, and therefore cash requirements are substantially less than the total commitment.

Unfunded credit commitments related to Market Street totaled $962 million at December 31, 2004 and $911 million at December 31, 2003 and are included in the preceding
table primarily within the “Commercial” and “Consumer” categories. See Note 2 Variable Interest Entities for further information regarding Market Street.

Net outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $3.7 billion at December 31, 2004 and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2003. Standby letters
of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of customers if certain specified future events occur. Such instruments are typically issued to support industrial revenue bonds, commercial paper, and bid-or-performance related contracts. Maturities
for standby letters of credit ranged from 2005 to 2014. See Note 28 Commitments And Guarantees for additional information.

At December 31, 2004, the largest industry concentration was for multifamily, which accounted for approximately 7.9% of the total letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances.

At December 31, 2004, we pledged $1.3 billion of loans to the FRB
and $20.9 billion of loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) as collateral for the contingent ability to borrow, if necessary.

Certain directors and executive officers of our subsidiaries, as well as certain affiliated companies of these directors and officers, were customers of and had loans
with subsidiary banks in the ordinary course of business. All such loans were on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other customers and did not
involve more than a normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features. The aggregate principal amounts of these loans were $19 million at December 31, 2004 and $11 million at December 31, 2003. During 2004, new loans of $57 million
were funded and repayments totaled $49 million.

We conduct an annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units. We conducted this review during the fourth quarter of 2004, using data from September 30, 2004. Aside from any adverse triggering events that may
occur earlier in the year, we will perform an annual test during the fourth quarter of each year. The fair value of our reporting units is determined by using discounted cash flow and market comparability methodologies.

A summary of the changes in goodwill by business during 2004 follows:

Goodwill

The United National acquisition
resulted in the recognition of $553 million of goodwill recorded in the Regional Community Banking business segment during 2004. Additionally, we recorded $35 million in customer-related intangible assets resulting from this transaction in 2004.

The acquisition of AFG in September 2004 resulted in the recognition of $35
million of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in the Wholesale Banking business segment.

See Note 3 Acquisitions for further information regarding the United National and AFG transactions.

Our ownership of BlackRock continues to change primarily when BlackRock repurchases its shares in the open market and issues shares pursuant to its employee compensation
plans. We recognize goodwill because BlackRock repurchases its shares at an amount greater than book value and this results in an increase in our percentage ownership interest. We recognized goodwill of $23 million in 2004 as a result of
BlackRock’s stock activity.

The gross carrying amount, accumulated
amortization and net carrying amount of other intangible assets by major category consisted of the following:

Other Intangible Assets

Most of our other intangible assets
have finite lives and are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis or, in the case of mortgage and other loan servicing rights, on an accelerated basis. At December 31, 2003, we had three indefinite-lived other intangible assets included in
“Customer-related and other intangibles” in the table above with a total carrying value of $11 million: two investment management contracts held by BlackRock and an intangible asset recorded pursuant to SFAS 87, “Employers’
Accounting for Pensions.” During the first quarter of 2004, one of the investment management contracts held by BlackRock was impaired when the funds’ portfolio manager resigned. As a result, BlackRock began an orderly liquidation of the
funds and recognized an impairment charge of $6 million in the first quarter of 2004. The total carrying value of the two remaining indefinite-lived intangible assets was $4 million at December 31, 2004.

For customer-related intangibles, the estimated remaining useful lives range from
approximately one year to 13 years, with a weighted-average remaining useful life of approximately five years. Our mortgage and other loan servicing rights are amortized primarily over a period of seven to ten years in proportion to the estimated
net servicing income from the related loans.



The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill and net other intangible assets during 2004 follows:

Changes in Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Amortization expense on intangible
assets for 2004 was $52 million. Amortization expense on existing intangible assets for 2005 through 2009 is estimated to be as follows:

•

2006: $49 million,

million in 2002.

We lease certain facilities and equipment under agreements
expiring at various dates through the year 2071. We account for substantially all such leases as operating leases. Rental expense on such leases amounted to $174 million in 2004, $177 million in 2003 and $174 million in 2002.

Required minimum annual rentals that we owe on noncancelable leases having initial or

(“GNMA”). The transactions and resulting receipt and subsequent sale of securities qualify as sales under the appropriate accounting criteria and resulted in pretax gains of $8 million in both 2004 and 2003. Additionally, we sold
commercial mortgage loans of $1.6 billion in 2004 and $1.1 billion in 2003 for cash in other loan sales transactions. These transactions resulted in pretax gains of $42 million in 2004 and $44 million in 2003.

For the transactions above, we continue to perform servicing for the commercial mortgage
loans and recognized servicing assets from these transactions of $14 million in 2004 and $13 million in 2003. In addition, we purchased servicing rights for commercial mortgage loans from third parties of approximately $47 million in 2004 and $23
million in 2003.

In addition to the cash proceeds from the sales transactions
above, net cash flows in 2004 and 2003 related to those transactions were not significant.

Changes in the commercial mortgage servicing assets were as follows:

Commercial Mortgage Servicing Assets

Assuming a prepayment speed of 11%-21%
for the respective strata discounted at 7%-8%, the estimated fair value of commercial mortgage servicing rights was $321 million at December 31, 2004. A 10% and 20% adverse change in all assumptions used to determine fair value at December 31, 2004,
results in a $20 million and $40 million decrease in fair value, respectively. No valuation allowance was necessary at December 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003.

We also own interest-only strips related to student loans totaling $60 million and $62 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. These strips
were retained from the sales of student loans to a third party trust prior to 2003. Loans that are held by the trust supporting the value of the strips were $178 million and $245 million at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. The
principal of these loans is effectively guaranteed by the federal government.

We have a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan. Holders of preferred stock and PNC
common stock may participate in the plan, which provides that additional shares of common stock may be purchased at market value with reinvested dividends and voluntary cash payments. Common shares issued pursuant to this plan were: 744,266 shares
in 2004, 799,820 shares in 2003, and 796,140 shares in 2002.

At December 31,
2004, we had reserved approximately 43.7 million common shares to be issued in connection with certain stock plans and the conversion of certain debt and equity securities.

In January 2002, our Board of Directors authorized us to purchase up to 35 million shares of our common stock through February 29, 2004.
Under this program, we purchased 10.8 million common shares during 2003 at a total cost of $507.8 million and .7 million shares at a total cost of $41.5 million during 2004.

In February 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 20 million shares of our common stock in open market or privately

ERIVATIVES

We use a variety of derivative financial instruments to help manage interest rate risk and reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows
caused by interest rate volatility. These instruments include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, future contracts, and total return swaps.

Fair Value Hedging Strategies

We enter into interest rate and
total return swaps, caps, floors and interest rate futures derivative contracts to hedge designated commercial mortgage loans held for sale, commercial loans, bank notes, senior debt and subordinated debt for changes in fair value primarily due to
changes in interest rates. Adjustments related to the ineffective portion of fair value hedging instruments are recorded in interest income, interest expense or noninterest income depending on the hedged item.



Cash Flow Hedging Strategy

We enter into interest rate swap contracts to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest
income. We are hedging our exposure to the variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for a maximum of 10 years for hedges converting floating-rate commercial loans to fixed. The fair value of these derivatives is reported in
other assets or other liabilities and offset in accumulated other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the derivatives. When the hedged transaction culminates, any unrealized gains or losses related to these swap contracts are
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings are included in interest income. Ineffectiveness of the strategy, as defined by
risk management policies and procedures, if any, is reported in interest income.

During the next twelve months, we expect to reclassify to earnings $4.9 million of pretax net gains, or $3.2 million after tax, on cash flow hedge derivatives currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. This amount could
differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates and the addition of other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2004. These net gains are anticipated to result from net cash flows on receive fixed interest rate swaps and would
mitigate reductions in interest income recognized on the related floating rate commercial loans.

As of December 31, 2004 we have determined that there were no hedging positions where it was probable that certain forecasted transactions may not occur within the originally designated time period.

If a derivative is not effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either
changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, then any ineffectiveness present in the hedge relationship is recognized in current earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in value of these derivatives
resulted in net gains of $5 million in both 2004 and 2003 and $4 million in 2002.

Free-Standing Derivatives

To accommodate customer needs, we also enter into financial derivative transactions primarily consisting
of interest rate swaps, caps, floors and foreign exchange and equity contracts. We manage our market risk exposure from customer positions through transactions with third-party dealers. The credit risk associated with derivatives executed with
customers is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans and is subject to normal credit policies. We may obtain collateral based on our assessment of the customer.

Basis swaps are agreements involving the exchange of payments, based on notional amounts, of two floating rate financial instruments
denominated in the same currency, one pegged to one reference rate and the other tied to a second reference rate (e.g., swapping payments tied to one-month LIBOR for payments tied to three-month LIBOR). We use these contracts to mitigate the impact
on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced interest rate.

We purchase
credit default swaps to mitigate the economic impact of credit losses on specifically identified existing lending relationships. These derivatives typically are based upon the change in value, due to changing credit spreads, of publicly-issued bonds
issued by our customer.

Interest rate lock commitments for, as well as
commitments to buy or sell, mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered free-standing derivatives. Our interest rate exposure on certain commercial mortgage interest rate lock commitments is economically hedged with pay-fixed interest rate
swaps and forward sales agreements. These contracts mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced rate.

Free-standing derivatives also include positions we take based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and the market
based upon stated risk management objectives.

Derivative Counterparty
Credit Risk

By purchasing and writing derivative contracts we are exposed to credit risk if the counterparties fail to perform. Our credit risk is
equal to the fair value gain in the derivative contract. We minimize credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures and collateral requirements. We generally enter into transactions with counterparties that carry high quality
credit ratings.

We enter into risk participation agreements to share some of
the credit exposure with other counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue. Risk participation agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2003 were considered financial guarantees and
therefore not included in derivatives. Agreements entered into subsequent to June 30, 2003 are included in the derivative table that follows. We determine that we meet our objective of reducing credit risk associated with certain counterparties to
derivative contracts when the participation agreements share in their proportional credit losses of those counterparties.

We generally have established agreements with our major derivative dealer counterparties that provide for exchanges of marketable securities or cash to collateralize
either party’s positions. At December 31, 2004 we held cash and U.S. government and mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $158 million and pledged U.S. agency and mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $204 million under
these agreements.



The total notional or contractual amounts, estimated net fair value and credit risk for derivatives at December 31, 2004
and 2003 were as follows:

We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Retirement benefits are derived
from a cash balance formula based on compensation levels, age and length of service. Pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants.

We also maintain nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees. All
retirement benefits provided under these plans are unfunded and we make any payments to plan participants. We also provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees (“postretirement benefits”) through
various plans.

On June 30, 2004, both qualified and nonqualified benefits for
PFPC employees were frozen, which resulted in a PNC pension plan remeasurement to reflect certain changes in plan provisions, including the curtailment of future pension costs at PFPC. This plan change resulted in a one-time curtailment gain of less
than $1 million.

We use a measurement date of December 31 for plan assets and
benefit obligations. A reconciliation of the changes in the projected benefit obligation for qualified and nonqualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans as well as the change in plan assets for the qualified pension plan is as follows:

(a)

Nonqualified pension benefits paid in 2003 include approximately $9.5 million of lump sum settlement payments to certain individuals.

The fair value of the qualified pension plan assets exceeds both the accumulated benefit
obligation and the projected benefit obligation. The nonqualified pension plan, which contains several individual plans that are accounted for together, is unfunded. Contributions from us and, in the case of postretirement benefit plans, participant
contributions cover all benefits paid under the nonqualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plans. The benefit obligations, asset values, funded status and balance sheet impacts are shown in the above table.

Assets related to our qualified pension plan (the “Plan”) are held in trust (the “Trust”). The Trust is exempt from tax pursuant to section 501(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). The Plan is qualified under section 401(a) of the Code. Plan assets consist primarily of listed domestic and international equity securities and U.S. government, agency, and corporate debt
securities. Plan assets do not include common or preferred stock or any debt of PNC.

We adopted the current Pension Plan Investment Policy Statement, including the updated target allocations and allowable ranges shown below, on May 30, 2002.

The long-term investment strategy for pension plan assets is to:

•

Meet present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries,

•

Cover reasonable expenses incurred to provide such benefits, including expense incurred in the administration of the Trust and the Plan,

•

Provide sufficient liquidity to meet benefit and expense payment requirements on a timely basis, and

•

Provide a total return that, over the long term, maximizes the ratio of trust assets to liabilities by maximizing investment return, at an appropriate level of risk.

The Plan’s specific investment objective is to meet or
exceed the investment policy benchmark over the long term. The investment policy benchmark compares actual performance to a weighted market index, and measures the contribution of active investment management and policy implementation. This
investment objective is expected to be achieved over the long term (one or more market cycles) and is measured over rolling five-year periods. Total return calculations are time-weighted and are net of investment-related fees and expenses.

The asset allocations for the Trust at the end of 2004 and 2003, and the
target allocation for 2005, by asset category, are as follows:

The slight overweight in domestic
equity at year-end 2003 and 2004 is attributable to the targeted allocation in Private Equity, which continues to be committed but which is funded over time as suitable opportunities for private equity investment are identified and as calls for
funding are made. The Investment Policy Statement provides that, from time to time, domestic equity may serve as a proxy (substitute) for private equity.

We believe that, over the long term, asset allocation is the single greatest determinant of risk. Asset allocation will deviate from the target percentages due to market
movement, cash flows, and investment manager performance. Material deviations from the asset allocation targets can alter the expected return and risk of the Trust. On the other hand, frequent rebalancing to the asset allocation targets may result
in significant transaction costs, which can impair the Trust’s ability to meet its investment objective. Accordingly, the Trust portfolio is periodically rebalanced to maintain asset allocation within the target ranges described above.

In addition to being diversified across asset classes, the Trust is
diversified within each asset class. Secondary diversification provides a reasonable expectation that no single security or class of securities will have a disproportionate impact on the total risk and return of the Trust.



The Pension Plan Administrative Committee (the “Committee”) selects investment managers for the Trust based on
the contributions that their respective investment styles and processes are expected to make to the investment performance of the overall portfolio. The managers’ Investment Objectives and Guidelines, which are a part of each manager’s
Investment Management Agreement, document performance expectations and each manager’s role in the portfolio. The Committee uses the Investment Objectives and Guidelines to establish, guide, control and measure the strategy and performance for
each manager.

The purpose of investment manager guidelines is to:

•

Establish the investment objective and performance standards for each manager,

•

Ensure that the manager has the capability to evaluate the risks of all financial instruments or other assets in which the manager’s account is invested, and

•

Prevent the manager from exposing its account to excessive levels of risk, undesired or inappropriate risk, or disproportionate concentration of risk.

The guidelines also indicate which investments and strategies the manager is permitted to use
to achieve its performance objectives, and which investments and strategies it is prohibited from using.

Where public market investment strategies may include the use of derivatives and/or currency management, language is incorporated in the managers’ guidelines to define allowable and prohibited transactions and/or
strategies. Derivatives are typically employed by investment managers to modify risk/return characteristics of their portfolio(s), implement asset allocation changes in a cost-effective manner, or reduce transaction costs. Under the managers’
investment guidelines, derivatives may not be used solely for speculation or leverage. Derivatives are used only in circumstances where they offer the most efficient economic means of improving risk/reward profile of the portfolio.

BlackRock, PNC Advisors and PFPC receive compensation for providing investment management,
trustee and custodial services for the majority of the Trust portfolio. Compensation for such services is paid by PNC. Non-affiliate service providers for the Trust are compensated from plan assets.

The following table provides information regarding our estimated future cash flows related to
our various plans:

Estimated Cash Flows

The qualified pension plan
contributions are deposited into a trust, and the qualified pension plan benefit payments are made from trust assets. The trustee is PNC Bank, N.A. For the other plans, total contributions and the benefit payments are the same and represent expected
benefit amounts, which are paid from general assets. Postretirement benefits are net of participant contributions. Due to the plan’s fully funded status, the qualified pension contribution in 2005 is currently estimated to be zero.



The components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost were as follows:

The weighted-average assumptions used
(as of the beginning of each year) to determine net periodic costs shown above were as follows:

The expected long-term return on plan
assets has been established by considering historical and future expected returns of the asset classes invested in by the Trust, and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes.

We have a contributory, qualified defined contribution plan that covers substantially all
employees except those covered by other plans as identified below. Under this plan, employee contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation as defined by the plan are matched 100%, subject to Code limitations. The plan is a 401(k) plan and includes
an employee stock ownership (“ESOP”) feature. Employee contributions are invested in a number of investment options available under the plan, including a PNC common stock fund and several BlackRock mutual funds, at the direction of the
employee. All shares of PNC common stock held by the plan are part of the ESOP. Employee contributions to the plan for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were matched primarily by shares of PNC common stock held in treasury, except in the case of those
participants who have exercised their diversification election rights to have their matching portion in other investments available within the plan. We also maintain a nonqualified supplemental savings plan for certain employees.

Employee benefits expense related to this plan was $48 million in 2004, $49 million in 2003
and $47 million in 2002. We measured employee benefits expense as the fair value of the shares and cash contributed to the plan by PNC.

Additionally, Hilliard Lyons sponsors a contributory, qualified defined contribution plan that covers substantially all of its employees who are not covered by the plan
described above. Contributions to this plan are made in cash and include a base contribution for those participants employed at December 31, a matching of employee contributions, and a discretionary profit sharing contribution as determined by
Hilliard Lyons’ Executive Compensation Committee. Employee benefits expense for this plan was $5 million in both 2004 and 2003 and $4 million in 2002.

Effective July 1, 2004, we adopted a separate qualified defined contribution plan that covers substantially all United States-based PFPC employees not covered by our
plan. The plan is a 401(k) plan and includes an ESOP feature. Under this plan,



employee contributions of up to 6% of eligible compensation as defined by the plan may be matched annually based on PFPC performance levels. Participants
must be employed as of December 31 of each year to receive this annual contribution. The performance-based employer matching contribution will be made primarily in shares of PNC common stock held in treasury, except in the case of those participants
who have exercised their diversification election rights to have their matching portion in other investments available within the plan. Mandatory employer contributions to this plan are made in cash and include employer basic and transitional
contributions. Employee-directed contributions are invested in a number of investment options available under the plan, including a PNC common stock fund and several BlackRock mutual funds, at the direction of the employee. Employee benefits expense
for this plan, which was effective July 1, 2004, was $5 million for 2004. We measured employee benefits expense as the fair value of the shares and cash contributed to the plan.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was enacted. The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, known as “Medicare
Part D,” and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. We believe that benefits provided to certain participants will be at least
actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and, accordingly, we will be entitled to a subsidy.

As outlined in Note 1 Accounting Policies, in May 2004 the FASB issued FSP 106-2. FSP 106-2 requires:

•

That the effects of the federal subsidy be considered an actuarial gain and recognized in the same manner as other actuarial gains and losses, and

•

Certain disclosures for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits.

We determined that the effects of the Act were not a significant event requiring an interim
remeasurement under SFAS 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.” Consequently, as permitted by FSP 106-2, net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2004 does not reflect the effects of the Act.
The benefit obligation for the postretirement benefit plan was remeasured at December 31, 2004 to reflect the effects of the Act, which resulted in a reduction in the benefit obligation of $11 million due to the federal subsidy. The Act also affects
plan premiums and assumptions, but the effect on benefit obligations was not significant and was not separately measured.

Options are granted at exercise prices not less than the market value of common stock on the date of
grant. Generally, options granted since 1999 become exercisable in installments after the grant date. Options granted prior to 1999 are mainly exercisable twelve months after the grant date. No option may be exercisable after 10 years from its grant
date. Payment of the option price may be in cash or previously owned shares of common stock at market value on the exercise date.

not recognize any stock-based compensation expense related to stock options as all options to purchase stock granted under our plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

In 2001 and 2000, respectively, we granted incentive
share awards potentially representing 9,000 and 609,000 shares of PNC common stock to certain senior executives pursuant to the Incentive Plan. Issuance of shares pursuant to these incentive awards was subject to meeting certain performance targets
over a three-year period. There were 169,500, 22,500 and 30,000 incentive shares forfeited during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Shares awarded under this grant were reduced on a share-for-share basis by 68,500 shares received by certain
executives from the 1998 incentive share award grant. In 2003, after completion of the three-year performance period, one-half of the shares awarded were issued and delivered without restrictions and the remaining one-half of the shares awarded were
issued as restricted shares and were released in January 2004 upon completion of the restricted period. Incentive shares totaling 264,000 in potential grants were cancelled under this award. During the restricted period, the recipients received
dividends and voting rights.

In 2003, we granted incentive share awards
potentially representing 659,250 shares of PNC common stock to certain senior executives pursuant to the Incentive Plan. Issuance of restricted shares pursuant to these incentive awards is subject to the achievement of one or more financial and
other performance goals over a three-year period. This number reflects the maximum number of shares that could be issued under these awards.

In 2004, we granted incentive share awards potentially representing 879,000 shares of PNC common stock to certain senior executives pursuant to the Incentive Plan.
Issuance of restricted shares pursuant to these incentive awards is subject to the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals over a two-year period. Shares awarded under this grant will be reduced on a share-for-share basis by
any shares that may be issued pursuant to the 2003 incentive share awards. The potential awards will be increased by the amount of phantom dividends during the performance period converted to incentive shares and added to the potential award amount.
Incentive shares totaling 34,164 were added to the grant with respect to deemed dividends during 2004.

In 2000, we granted 245,000 shares of restricted stock to senior executives with a three-year vesting period. Of these, 35,000 shares were forfeited in 2002. The restricted period for all but 40,000 of the restricted
shares ended November 15, 2003.

In 2002, we granted 109,138 shares of
restricted stock to senior executives with vesting periods ranging from 24 months to 50 months. There were 737 and 1,551 restricted shares forfeited during 2004 and 2002 respectively. The restricted period for all but 66,850 shares ended during
2004.

In 2003, we granted 520,446 shares of restricted stock to senior
executives with vesting periods ranging from 24 months to 47 months. There were 2,607 and 7,062 restricted shares forfeited in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In 2004, we granted 342,188 shares of restricted stock to senior executives with vesting periods ranging from 17 months to 43 months. Of these, 1,610 shares were
forfeited in 2004. Additionally, we granted 369,854 shares of restricted stock to certain key employees. These shares vest 100% after three years. Of these, 11,232 shares were forfeited in 2004.

We also granted 63,500, 67,900 and 52,000 shares of restricted stock to certain key employees
in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These shares vest 25% after three years, 25% after four years and 50% after five years. Shares forfeited were 11,375, 10,975 and 6,800 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

We granted 13,000 shares of restricted stock to non-employee directors in 2001. One-half of
these shares vest after one year and the remainder after two years. In 2002, 1,000 of these shares were forfeited.



The weighted-average grant-date fair value of incentive share and restricted stock awards granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002
was $54.46, $44.23 and $45.69 per share, respectively. We recognized compensation expense (income) for incentive share and restricted stock awards totaling $25 million, $20 million and $(1) million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The net
credit to expense in 2002 was due to forfeitures and adjustments of accruals related to performance-based awards under the Incentive Plan.

A table is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies that sets forth pro forma income from continuing
operations and basic and diluted earnings per share as if compensation expense had been recognized under SFAS 123, as amended, for stock options and the ESPP for 2004, 2003 and 2002.

For purposes of computing 2004 stock option expense and pro forma results, we estimated the fair value of stock options and ESPP shares
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model requires the use of numerous assumptions, many of which are highly subjective in nature. Therefore, the pro forma results are estimates of results of operations as if compensation expense had
been recognized for all stock-based compensation plans and are not indicative of the impact on future periods. The following assumptions were used in the option pricing model for purposes of estimating pro forma results as well as 2004 stock option
expense. The dividend yield represents average yields over the previous three-year period. Volatility is measured using the fluctuation in month-end closing stock prices over a five-year period.

BlackRock’s long-term retention and incentive plan (“LTIP”) permits the grant of up to $240 million in deferred compensation awards (the “LTIP
Awards”), subject to the achievement of certain performance hurdles by BlackRock no later than March 2007. If the performance hurdles are achieved, up to $200 million of the LTIP Awards will be funded with up to 4 million shares of BlackRock
common stock to be surrendered by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants, less income tax withholding. Shares attributable to value in excess of our $200 million LTIP funding requirement will be available to support BlackRock’s future
long-term retention and incentive programs but are not subject to surrender until the programs are approved by BlackRock’s Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors. In addition, shares distributed to LTIP participants will include an
option to put such distributed shares back to BlackRock at fair market value. BlackRock will fund the remainder of the LTIP Awards with up to $40 million in cash. In general, LTIP participants must also be employed by BlackRock on the payment date
in early 2007 to receive payment for an award. As of January 31, 2005, BlackRock had awarded approximately $230 million in LTIP Awards.

The LTIP Awards will fully vest at the end of any three-month period beginning on or after January 1, 2005 and ending on or prior to March 30, 2007 during which the
average closing price of BlackRock’s common stock is at least $62 per share. In addition, the vesting of awards is contingent on the participants’ continued employment with BlackRock for periods ranging from two to five years. An
alternative performance hurdle provides for partial vesting of the LTIP based on specific targets for BlackRock’s earnings growth and relative stock price performance to peers over the term of the LTIP, subject to the authority of
BlackRock’s Compensation Committee to reduce the amount of awards vested under the LTIP.

Based on the price performance of its common shares, BlackRock management determined that full vesting of the LTIP awards was probable as of September 30, 2004, and as a result recorded a charge and a related
liability in its third quarter 2004 results. This charge took into account the value of the awards granted through September 30, 2004 and the applicable service period. We reported a pretax charge totaling $96 million, including $89 million reported
as compensation expense, $2 million of employee benefit expense and $5 million of other noninterest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income. The after-tax impact on our third quarter 2004 results after taking into account the adjustment for
minority interests (we owned approximately 71% of BlackRock in 2004) was $42 million, or $.15 per diluted share. This includes a pro rata share of the estimated dilution of our investment in BlackRock that is expected to occur in 2007 when we
transfer shares of BlackRock stock to fund a portion of the LTIP Awards.

Fourth quarter 2004 LTIP pretax charges reported by PNC totaled $14 million, comprised of $13 million of compensation expense and $1 million of “Other” noninterest expense.

We expect to report additional pretax charges of approximately $15 million per quarter
through December 2006 related to the remaining service period of the LTIP Awards granted to date, assuming the LTIP Awards vest or full vesting remains probable.

Additional information on the third quarter 2004 LTIP charge is included in our and BlackRock’s Current Reports on Form 8-K dated
October 6, 2004.

At December 31, 2004 we had available
$12 million of federal and state income tax net operating loss carryforwards originating from an acquired company which will expire from 2019 through 2022.

As discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies, the 2004 Act created a one-time opportunity for US companies to repatriate undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries at
a substantially reduced federal tax rate. The reduced rate is achieved via an 85% dividends received deduction. In our case, foreign earnings must be repatriated by December 31, 2005 in order to qualify for this benefit. Two of our subsidiaries,
BlackRock and PFPC, have foreign subsidiaries with undistributed earnings that may be available for repatriation. There are a variety of additional technical requirements relating to the use of the repatriated earnings that must be considered to
take advantage of the reduced tax rate. We have begun to evaluate the feasibility of repatriating the undistributed earnings of BlackRock and PFPC’s foreign subsidiaries and expect to complete our evaluation by the end of the second quarter of
2005. We are considering the repatriation of up to $53 million of foreign earnings, of which $30 million relates to BlackRock and $23 million relates to PFPC. In accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 23, we have recorded income taxes on
the earnings of PFPC’s foreign subsidiaries but have not done so for BlackRock’s foreign subsidiaries. The tax effect of repatriation could range from a $7 million benefit to a $2 million expense.

EPORTING

We operate five major businesses engaged in providing banking, asset management and global fund
processing products and services. Banking businesses include regional community banking, wholesale banking and wealth management. Assets, revenue and earnings attributable to foreign activities were not material in the periods presented.

Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting
practices and our operating structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar
information for any other company. We refine our methodologies from time to time as our management accounting practices are enhanced and our businesses change. Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated
on a stand-alone basis.

As more fully described in our Current Report on Form
8-K dated April 5, 2004, we changed our financial reporting for our business segments beginning with first quarter 2004 reporting and restated all prior period amounts to conform with the new methodology. The principal changes to our segment
reporting are as follows:

•

We replaced the assignment of securities or funds to balance net assets for each business segment with a funds transfer pricing methodology.

•

We removed the impact of our asset and liability management function from the business segments. This is now reflected in the results of “Other.”

•

The Wholesale Banking business segment captures the results that were previously reported separately as Corporate Banking, PNC Real Estate Finance and PNC Business Credit to more
accurately reflect the integrated operating strategy of this business.

•

We have implemented a new capital measurement methodology based on the concept of economic capital.



Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing
methodology that incorporates product maturities, duration and other factors. Capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to the banking and processing businesses using our risk-based economic capital model. We increased the
capital assigned to Regional Community Banking to 6% of funds to reflect the capital required for well-capitalized banks and to approximate market comparables for this business. The capital for BlackRock reflects legal entity shareholders’
equity consistent with BlackRock’s separate public disclosures. We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on our assessment of risk inherent in the loan portfolios. The
costs incurred by operations and other support areas not directly aligned with the businesses are allocated primarily based on the use of services.

Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated results. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Intercompany Eliminations”
and “Other” categories. “Intercompany Eliminations” reflects activities conducted among our businesses that are eliminated in the consolidated results. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria
for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities, related net securities gains, equity management activities and minority interest in income of BlackRock, differences between business segment
performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), and corporate overhead.

NDEMNIFICATIONS

We are a party to numerous acquisition or divestiture agreements under which we have purchased or sold, or agreed to purchase or sell, various types of assets. These
agreements can cover the purchase or sale of:

•

Entire businesses,

•

Loan portfolios,

•

Branch banks,

•

Partial interests in companies, or

•

Other types of assets.

These agreements generally include indemnification provisions under which we indemnify third parties to these agreements against a variety of risks to the indemnified parties as a result



of the transaction in question. When PNC is the seller, the indemnification provisions will generally also provide the buyer with protection relating to the
quality of the assets we are selling and the extent of any liabilities being assumed by the buyer. Due to the nature of these indemnification provisions, we cannot quantify the total potential exposure to us resulting from them.

We provide indemnification in connection with securities offering transactions in which we
are involved. When we are the issuer of the securities, we provide indemnification to the underwriters or placement agents analogous to the indemnification provided to the purchasers of businesses from us, as described above. When we are an
underwriter or placement agent, we provide a limited indemnification to the issuer related to our actions in connection with the offering and, if there are other underwriters, indemnification to the other underwriters intended to result in an
appropriate sharing of the risk of participating in the offering. Due to the nature of these indemnification provisions, we cannot quantify the total potential exposure to us resulting from them.

We enter into certain types of agreements that include provisions for indemnifying third
parties, such as:

•

Agreements relating to providing various servicing and processing functions to third parties,

•

Agreements relating to the creation of trusts or other legal entities to facilitate leasing transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions (loan securitizations)
and certain other off-balance sheet transactions,

•

Syndicated credit agreements, as a syndicate member,

•

Sales of individual loans, and

•

Litigation settlement agreements.

Due to the nature of these indemnification provisions, we cannot calculate our aggregate potential exposure under them.

We enter into certain types of agreements, including leases, assignments of leases, and
subleases, in which we agree to indemnify third parties for acts by our agents, assignees and/or sublessees, and employees. While we do not believe these indemnification liabilities are material, either individually or in total, we cannot calculate
our potential exposure.

We enter into contracts for the delivery of technology
service in which we indemnify the other party against claims of patent and copyright infringement by third parties. Due to the nature of these indemnification provisions, we cannot calculate our aggregate potential exposure under this type of
indemnification.

We engage in certain insurance activities which require our
employees to be bonded. We satisfy this bonding requirement by issuing letters of credit in a total amount of approximately $5 million.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts with third parties under which the third parties provide services on behalf of PNC. In many of these
contracts, we agree to indemnify the third party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnity vary from contract to contract and the amount of the indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined.

We are a general or limited partner in certain asset management and investment limited
partnerships, many of which contain indemnification provisions that would require us to make payments in excess of our remaining funding commitments. While in certain of these partnerships the maximum liability to us is limited to the sum of our
unfunded commitments and partnership distributions received by us, in the others the indemnification liability is unlimited. As a result, we cannot determine our aggregate potential exposure for these indemnifications.

Pursuant to their bylaws, PNC and its subsidiaries provide indemnification to directors,
officers and, in some cases, employees and agents against certain liabilities incurred as a result of their service on behalf of or at the request of PNC and its subsidiaries. PNC and its subsidiaries also advance on behalf of covered individuals
costs incurred in connection with certain claims or proceedings, subject to written undertakings by each such individual to repay all amounts so advanced if it is ultimately determined that the individual is not entitled to indemnification. We
advanced such costs on behalf of several such individuals with respect to pending litigation or investigations during 2004. It is not possible for us to determine the aggregate potential exposure resulting from the obligation to provide this
indemnity or to advance such costs.

In connection with the lending of
securities held by PFPC as an intermediary on behalf of certain of its clients, we provide indemnification to those clients against the failure of the borrowers to return the securities. The market value of the securities lent is fully secured on a
daily basis; therefore, the exposure to us is limited to temporary shortfalls in the collateral as a result of short-term fluctuations in trading prices of the loaned securities. At December 31, 2004, the total maximum potential exposure as a result
of these indemnity obligations was approximately $6.6 billion, although we held collateral at the time in excess of that amount.

VENTS

On January 18, 2005, our ownership in BlackRock was transferred from PNC Bank, N.A. to PNC Bancorp, Inc., our intermediate bank holding company. The transfer was effected
primarily to give BlackRock more operating flexibility, particularly in connection with its acquisition of SSRM. As a result of the transfer, certain deferred tax liabilities recorded by PNC will be reversed in the first quarter of 2005 in
accordance with SFAS 109. Based on our assumptions and subject to completion of a tax basis analysis by a third party, we currently expect the impact of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities to increase our earnings by $45 million, or
approximately $.16 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2005.

In
February 2005, BlackRock issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures (the “Debentures”), which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at an annual rate of 2.625%. BlackRock used a portion of the net proceeds
from this issuance to retire a $150 million bridge promissory note, the proceeds of which were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of its acquisition of SSRM on January 31, 2005, and plans to use the remainder of the net proceeds for
general corporate purposes.

Prior to February 15, 2009, the Debentures will be
convertible, only under certain conditions, at the option of the holder into cash and, in certain circumstances, shares of BlackRock’s class A common stock at an initial conversion rate of 9.7282 shares of class A common stock per $1,000
principal amount of Debentures, subject to adjustments, representing a premium of 32.5% to the last reported sale price of BlackRock’s class A common stock on February 16, 2005 of $77.58. On and after February 15, 2009, the Debentures will be
convertible at any time prior to maturity at the option of the holder into cash and, in certain circumstances, shares of BlackRock class A common stock at the above initial conversion rate, subject to adjustments.

Beginning February 20, 2010, BlackRock may redeem any of the Debentures at a redemption price
of 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest and accrued and unpaid liquidated damages, if any. Holders may require BlackRock to repurchase the Debentures at a repurchase price equal to 100% of
their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest and accrued and unpaid liquidated damages, if any, on February 15, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030, or at any time prior to their maturity upon the occurrence of
certain events.

In January 2005, PFPC settled outstanding litigation with a
former transfer agency client that terminated its contractual relationship with PFPC during 2004. PFPC accepted approximately $10 million from the former client to settle the matter, which will be reflected in our first quarter 2005 results and in
the PFPC business segment results.

Nonaccrual loans are included in
loans, net of unearned income. The impact of financial derivatives used in interest rate risk management is included in the interest income/expense and average yields/rates of the related assets and liabilities. Basis adjustments related to hedged
items are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities. Average balances of securities are based on amortized historical cost (excluding SFAS 115 adjustments to fair value which are included in other assets). Loan fees
for each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $109 million, $110 million and $106 million, respectively. Interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a marginal federal income tax rate of 35% to
increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to interest income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $20 million, $10 million and $13 million, respectively.

(a)

Excluding $804 million of net charge-offs in 2001 related to the institutional lending repositioning initiative, net charge-offs would have been .32% of average loans and the
allowance as a multiple of net charge-offs would have been 3.89x.

(b)

Excluding $714 million of provision in 2001 related to the institutional lending repositioning initiative, provision for credit losses would have been .42% of average loans.

The following table presents the assignment of the allowance for
loan and lease losses and the categories of loans as a percentage of total loans. Changes in the allocation over time reflect the changes in loan portfolio composition, risk profile and refinements to reserve methodologies. For purposes of this
presentation, a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses has been assigned to loan categories based on the relative specific and pool allocation amounts to provide coverage for probable losses not covered in specific, pool and consumer
reserve methodologies related to qualitative and measurement factors. At December 31, 2004, the portion of the reserves for these factors was $101 million.

ROCEDURES

(a) Management’s
Responsibility For Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (“PNC”) is responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of its published consolidated financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, as such, include judgments and estimates of management. PNC also prepared the other information included in this Form 10-K and is
responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. The internal control system is augmented by written policies and procedures and by audits performed by an
internal audit staff, which reports to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Internal auditors test the operation of the internal control system and report findings to management and the Audit Committee, and appropriate corrective and other
actions are taken to address identified control deficiencies and other opportunities for improving the system. The Audit Committee, composed solely of independent directors, provides oversight to management’s conduct of the financial reporting
process.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of
internal control, including the possibility of human error and circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and
financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.

We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice Chairman
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of PNC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in
“Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that PNC maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm that audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report, has issued an unqualified report on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of PNC’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004. The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP appears below.

(b) Report Of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders of

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

We have
audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying “Management’s Responsibility For Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company;



(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,
material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that
the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on the criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended of the Company
and our report dated February 28, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

February 28,

(c) Internal Controls and Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2004, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our
internal control over financial reporting.

Based on that evaluation, our
management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2004, and that there has been no change in
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
