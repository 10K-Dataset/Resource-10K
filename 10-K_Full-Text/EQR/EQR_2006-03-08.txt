EQUITY RESIDENTIAL



Item 1. Business

General

Equity Residential (“EQR”), a Maryland real estate
investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993, is a fully integrated real
estate company primarily engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership,
management and operation of multifamily properties. In addition, EQR may acquire
or develop multifamily properties specifically to convert directly into
condominiums as well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual
condominiums. EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based
on market opportunities. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT.

The Company is one of the largest publicly traded
real estate companies and is the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily
properties (based on the aggregate market value of its outstanding Common
Shares, the number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned). The
Company’s corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the
Company also leases (under operating leases) approximately forty property
management offices throughout the United States.

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31,
2005 owned an approximate 93.4% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited
Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). The
Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), under which
all property ownership and business operations are conducted through the
Operating Partnership and its various subsidiaries. References to the “Company”
include EQR, the Operating Partnership and each of the partnerships, limited
liability companies and corporations controlled by the Operating Partnership
and/or EQR.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company, directly
or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a
portion of 926

properties in 31 states and the
District of Columbia consisting of 197,404 units. The ownership breakdown
includes:

As of March 1, 2006, the Company has
approximately 6,000 employees who provide real estate operations, leasing,
legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition, development and other
support functions.

Certain capitalized terms
as used herein are defined in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Objectives and Operating Strategies

The Company seeks to maximize current income,
capital appreciation of each property and the total return for its
shareholders.


The Company’s strategy for
accomplishing these objectives includes:

•

Leveraging
our size and scale in four critical ways:

•

Investing
in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets, to maximize
our total return on an enterprise level;

•

Meeting
the needs of our residents by offering a wide array of product choices and a
commitment to service;

•

Engaging,
retaining, and attracting the best people by providing them with the education,
resources and opportunities to succeed; and

•

Sharing
resources, customers and best practices in property management and across the
enterprise.

•

Owning
a highly diversified portfolio by investing in target markets defined by a
combination of the following criteria:

•

High barrier-to-entry (low supply);

•

Strong economic predictors (high demand); and

•

Attractive quality of life (high demand and
retention).

•

Giving
residents reasons to stay with Equity by providing a range of product options
available in our diversified portfolio and by enhancing their experience
through our employees and our services.

•

Being
open and responsive to market realities to take advantage of investment
opportunities that align with our long-term vision.

Acquisition, Development and Disposition Strategies

The Company anticipates that future property
acquisitions and developments will occur within the United States. Acquisitions
and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include
retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt securities, sales of
properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized
borrowings. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in
transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the
Operating Partnership (“OP Units”) as consideration for the acquired
properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers
to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain, which
might otherwise result from the sales.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, developments
and dispositions, the Company generally considers the following factors:

•

strategically
targeted markets;

•

income
levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market;

•

employment
and household growth and net migration of the relevant market’s population;

•

barriers
to entry that would limit competition (zoning laws, building permit
availability, supply of undeveloped or developable real estate, local building
costs and construction labor costs among other factors);

•

the
location, construction quality, condition and design of the property;

•

the
current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase
cash flow;

•

the
potential for capital appreciation of the property;

•

the
terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases;

•

the
potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the
community in which the property is located;


•

the
occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the
vicinity (the overall market and submarket);

•

the
prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property;

•

the
benefits of integration into existing operations;

•

purchase
prices and yields of available existing stabilized properties, if any;

•

competition
from existing multifamily properties, residential properties under development
and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the
area; and

•

opportunistic
selling based on demand and price of high quality assets, including condominium
conversions.

The Company generally reinvests the proceeds
received from property dispositions primarily to achieve its acquisition and
development strategies. In addition, when feasible, the Company may structure
these transactions as tax deferred exchanges.

Debt and Equity Activity

The Company’s “Consolidated Debt-to-Total Market
Capitalization Ratio” as of December 31, 2005 is presented in the
following table. The Company calculates the equity component of its market
capitalization as the sum of (i) the total outstanding Common Shares and
assumed conversion of all OP Units at the equivalent market value of the
closing price of the Company’s Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) the
“Common Share Equivalent” of all convertible preferred shares and preference
interests/units; and (iii) the liquidation value of all perpetual
preferred shares and preference interests outstanding.

million
receiving net proceeds of $58.5 million.

Credit Facilities

On April 1, 2005, the Operating Partnership
obtained a new three-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility
maturing on May 29, 2008, and terminated the $700.0 million credit
facility that was scheduled to expire on May 29, 2005. The Operating
Partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings up to $500.0
million under certain circumstances. Advances under the new credit facility
bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest periods
plus a spread dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s credit rating or based
on bids received from the lending group. EQR has guaranteed the Operating
Partnership’s credit facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of
the facility.

On August 30, 2005, the Operating Partnership
obtained a new one-year $600.0 million revolving credit facility maturing on August 29,
2006. EQR had guaranteed this credit facility up to the maximum amount and for
its full term. The Operating Partnership terminated this short-term revolving
credit facility on January 20, 2006.

As of December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004, $769.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, was outstanding and
$50.2 million and $65.4 million, respectively, was restricted (dedicated to
support letters of credit and not available for borrowing) on the credit
facilities. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the lines of
credit were 3.80% and 1.73%, respectively.

Competition

All of the Company’s properties are located in
developed areas that include other multifamily properties. The number of
competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material
effect on the Company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any
newly acquired properties and on the rents charged. The Company may be
competing with other entities that have greater resources than the Company and
whose managers have more experience than the Company’s managers. In addition,
other forms of rental properties and single-family housing provide housing
alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties. See Item 1A Risk
Factors for additional information with respect to competition.

Environmental Considerations

See Item 1A Risk Factors for information concerning
the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

General

The following Risk Factors may contain defined terms that are
different from those used in the other sections of this report. Unless
otherwise indicated, when used in this section, the terms “we” and “us” refer
to Equity Residential and its subsidiaries, including ERP Operating Limited
Partnership.


The occurrence of the events discussed in the
following risk factors could adversely affect, possibly in a material manner,
our business, financial condition or results of operations, which could
adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or
preferred shares of beneficial interest (which we refer to collectively as “Shares”);
preference interests (“Interests”) of a subsidiary of ERP Operating Limited
Partnership, our operating partnership. In this section, we refer to the
Shares, Interests, Units and the OP Units together as our “securities”, and the
investors who own Shares, Interests, Units and/or OP Units as our “security
holders”.

Our Performance and
Securities Value are Subject to Risks Associated with the Real Estate Industry

General

Real property investments are subject to varying
degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid. Several factors may adversely
affect the economic performance and value of our properties. These factors
include changes in the national, regional and local economic climates, local
conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in
demand for our multifamily properties, the attractiveness of our properties to
residents, competition from other available multifamily property owners and
changes in market rental rates. Our performance also depends on our ability to
collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance, insurance and
other operating costs, including real estate taxes, which could increase over
time. Also, the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily
reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a
reduction in income from the property.

We May be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Units as Leases Expire

When our residents decide not to renew their leases
upon expiration, we may not be able to relet their units. Even if the
residents do renew or we can relet the units, the terms of renewal or reletting
may be less favorable than current lease terms. Because virtually all of
our leases are for apartments, they are generally for terms of no more than one
year. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units, or if
the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than
expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition will be
adversely affected. Consequently, our cash flow and ability to service debt and
make distributions to security holders would be reduced.

New Acquisitions, Developments and/or Condominium Conversion Projects May Fail
to Perform as Expected and Competition for Acquisitions May Result in
Increased Prices for Properties

We intend to actively acquire and develop
multifamily properties for rental operations and/or specifically to convert
directly into condominiums as well as upgrade and sell existing properties as
individual condominiums. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring
an acquired or condominium conversion property up to standards established for
its intended market position or to develop a property. Additionally, we expect
that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete
with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop
properties in markets where we focus our development efforts. This competition may increase
prices for multifamily properties or decrease the price we expect to sell
individual condominiums. We may not be in a position or have the
opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable
terms.  We also plan to develop more
properties ourselves in addition to co-investing with our development partners
for either the rental or condominium market, depending on opportunities in each
sub-market. This may increase the overall level of risk associated with
developments. The total number of development units, cost of development and
estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing
economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials),
competition and local government regulation.


Because Real Estate Investments Are Illiquid, We May Not Be Able
To Sell Properties When Appropriate

Real estate investments generally cannot be sold
quickly. We may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response
to economic or other conditions. This inability to respond promptly to changes
in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial
condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders.

Changes in Laws and Litigation Risk Could Affect Our Business

We are generally not able to pass through to our
residents under existing leases real estate or other federal, state or local
taxes. Consequently, any such tax increases may adversely affect our
financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security
holders. Similarly, changes that increase our potential liability under
environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance would
adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our
securities.

As the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily
properties, we may become involved in legal proceedings, including but not
limited to, proceedings related to consumer, employment, tort and commercial
legal issues, that if decided adversely to or settled by us, could result in
liability material to our financial condition or results of operations.

Environmental Problems are Possible and can be Costly

Federal, state and local laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or
previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous
or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property. The owner
or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for
property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such
parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose
clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or
operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than
one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person
covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the
clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or
operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental
contamination emanating from that site.

Substantially all of our properties have been the
subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent
environmental consultant companies. These environmental assessments have not
revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that our management
believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Over the past four years, there have been an
increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily
properties other than the Company alleging personal injury and property damage
caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these
lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Insurance
carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related
claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively
high rates. We have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold
in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and
resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents
or the property.

We cannot be assured that existing environmental
assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any
prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental
condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not
otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties.


Insurance Policy Deductibles and Exclusions

In order to partially mitigate the substantial increase
in insurance costs in recent years, management has determined to gradually
increase deductible and self-insured retention amounts. As of December 31,
2005, the Company’s property insurance policy (for Wholly Owned Properties)
provides for a per occurrence deductible of $250,000 and self-insured retention of $5.0 million per occurrence,
subject to a maximum annual aggregate self-insured retention of $7.5 million,
with any excess losses being covered by insurance. Any earthquake and named
windstorm losses are subject to a deductible of 2% (5% for California
earthquakes) of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not
subject to the aggregate self-insured retention. The Company’s liability and
worker’s compensation policies at December 31, 2005, provide for a $1.0
million per occurrence deductible. These higher deductible and self-insured
retention amounts do expose the Company to greater potential uninsured losses,
such as the property damage caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters,
but management believes the savings in insurance premium expense justifies this
increased exposure over the long-term.

As a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001, property insurance carriers have created exclusions for losses from terrorism
from our “all risk” property insurance policies. While separate terrorism
insurance coverage is available in certain instances, premiums for such
coverage are generally very expensive and deductibles are very high. Additionally,
the terrorism insurance coverage that is available typically excludes coverage
for losses from nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. At the present time,
the Company has determined that it is not economically prudent to obtain
property terrorism insurance for its entire portfolio to the extent otherwise
available, especially given the significant risks that are not covered by such
insurance. As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s high-rise properties
were insured for $300 million in terrorism insurance coverage, with a $2.5
million deductible. In the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of
the properties, we could lose the revenues from the property, our capital
investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or
others suffering injuries or losses. The Company believes, however, that the
number and geographic diversity of its portfolio and its high-rise terrorism
insurance coverage help to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with
potential terrorist attacks.

Debt Financing,
Preferred Shares and Preference Interests and Units Could Adversely Affect Our
Performance

General

The Company’s total debt summary, as of December 31,
2005, included:


(1) Net of the effect of any derivative instruments.

In addition to debt, we have $564.3 million of
combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial
interest and preference interests and units, with a weighted average dividend
preference of 7.98% per annum, as of December 31, 2005. Our use of debt
and preferred equity financing creates certain risks, including the following:

Scheduled Debt Payments Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition

In the future, our cash flow could be insufficient
to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on
our securities at expected levels.

We may not be able to refinance existing debt
(which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at
maturity) and, if we can, the terms of such refinancing might not be as
favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. If principal payments due at
maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or paid with proceeds of other capital
transactions, such as new equity capital, our cash flow will not be sufficient
in all years to repay all maturing debt. As a result, we may be forced to
postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties
and may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would
otherwise be unacceptable to us. The Company’s debt maturity schedule as
of December 31, 2005 is as follows:


(1) Includes $150.0 million of 7.57%
  unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2026 that is putable in 2006. Also
  includes $215.0 million outstanding on the Company’s short-term $600.0
  million unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility was terminated on January 20,
  2006 in conjunction with the Company’s $400.0 million unsecured note issuance
  which closed on January 19, 2006.

(2) Includes $554.0 million
  outstanding on the Company’s long-term unsecured revolving credit facility,
  which matures on May 29, 2008.

Financial Covenants Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Financial
Condition

If a property we own is mortgaged to secure payment
of indebtedness and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments, the holder of
the mortgage could foreclose on the property, resulting in loss of income and
asset value. Foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance
existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial
condition and results of operations.

The mortgages on our properties may contain
negative covenants that, among other things, limit our ability, without the
prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the property and to reduce or
change insurance coverage. In addition, our unsecured credit facilities contain
certain restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to
incur indebtedness. The indentures under which a substantial portion of our
debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants
including, among other things, maintenance of certain financial ratios, as well
as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness
(including acquisition financing), and to sell all or substantially all of our
assets. Our credit facilities and indentures are cross-defaulted and also
contain cross default provisions with other material indebtedness. Our most
restrictive unsecured public debt covenants as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively, are (terms are defined in the indentures):


Some of the properties were financed with tax-exempt
bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions. We have
retained an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the
restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties. If
these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental
rates to attract low or moderate-income residents, or eligible/qualified
residents, then our income from these properties may be limited.

Our Degree of Leverage Could Limit Our Ability to Obtain Additional
Financing

Our Consolidated Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization
Ratio was 37% as of December 31, 2005. Our degree of leverage could have
important consequences to security holders. For example, the degree of leverage
could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other
general corporate purposes, making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business
or the economy in general.

Rising Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow

Advances under our credit facilities bear interest
at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest periods, plus a spread
dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s credit rating, or based upon bids
received from the lending group. Certain public issuances of our senior
unsecured debt instruments may also, from time to time, bear interest at
floating rates. We may also borrow additional money with variable interest
rates in the future. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest
expenses under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of
refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. Accordingly, higher
interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our
debt and to make distributions to security holders. We use interest rate
hedging arrangements to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility, but
these arrangements may expose us to additional risks, and no strategy can
completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. There
can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will have the desired
beneficial impact and may involve costs, such as transaction fees or
breakage costs, if we terminate them.

We Depend on Our Key Personnel

We depend on the efforts of the Chairman of our
Board of Trustees, Samuel Zell, and our executive officers, particularly David
J. Neithercut, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Gerald A. Spector,
our Chief Operating Officer. If they resign, our operations could be
temporarily adversely affected. Mr. Zell has entered into executive
compensation and retirement benefit agreements with the Company. Mr. Spector
has entered into a Deferred Compensation Agreement with the Company that under
certain conditions could provide him with a salary benefit after his
termination of employment with the Company. In addition, Mr. Zell and Mr. Spector
have entered into Noncompetition Agreements with the Company.


In the event the Chairman of the Board and/or the
CEO are unable to serve, (i) the Lead Trustee shall automatically be
appointed to serve as the interim successor to the Chairman, (ii) the
Chairman shall automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to
the CEO and (iii) the Chair of the Compensation Committee of the Board
will immediately call a meeting of the Committee to recommend to the full Board
the selection of a permanent replacement for either or both positions, as
necessary.

Control and Influence by Significant Shareholders Could be Exercised in
a Manner Adverse to Other Shareholders

As of December 31, 2005, Samuel Zell, our
Chairman of the Board, certain affiliates of Mr. Zell, and certain of our
executive officers and trustees, owned (or could potentially acquire upon the
exchange of OP Units held by certain of such parties) a number of our common
shares. In addition, the consent of certain affiliates of Mr. Zell is
required for certain amendments to the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of
Limited Partnership of ERP Operating Limited Partnership (the “Partnership
Agreement”). As a result of their security ownership and rights concerning
amendments to the Partnership Agreement, the security holders referred to
herein may have influence over the Company. Although these security
holders have not agreed to act together on any matter, they would be in a
position to exercise even more influence over the Company’s affairs if they
were to act together in the future. This influence could conceivably be
exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security
holders. For additional information regarding the security ownership of our
trustees, including Mr. Zell, and our executive officers, see the Company’s
definitive proxy statement.

Shareholders’ Ability to Effect Changes in Control of the Company is
Limited

Provisions of Our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws Could Inhibit Changes
in Control

Certain provisions of our Declaration of Trust and
Bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or other
transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the
then-prevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in
the best interest of our security holders. This includes the 5% Ownership Limit
described below. Also, any future series of preferred shares of beneficial
interest may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a
change of control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest
of our security holders.

We Have a Share Ownership Limit for REIT Tax Purposes

To remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding Shares may be
owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during
the last half of any year. To facilitate maintenance of our REIT qualification,
our Declaration of Trust, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits ownership by
any single shareholder of more than 5% of the lesser of the number or value of
the outstanding class of common or preferred shares. We refer to this
restriction as the “Ownership Limit.” 
Absent any exemption or waiver granted by our Board of Trustees,
securities acquired or held in violation of the Ownership Limit will be
transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary,
and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate. A
transfer of Shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the
Ownership Limit. The Ownership Limit could delay or prevent a change in control
and, therefore, could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize
a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their Shares. To reduce the
ability of the Board to use the Ownership Limit as an anti-takeover device, in
2004 the Company amended the Ownership Limit to require, rather than permit,
the Board to grant a waiver of the Ownership Limit if the individual seeking a
waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the Company’s
status as a REIT.


Our Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest May Affect Changes in
Control

Our Declaration of Trust authorizes the Board of
Trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares of beneficial interest,
and to establish the preferences and rights (including the right to vote and
the right to convert into common shares) of any preferred shares issued. The
Board of Trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set
the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the
Company, even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders.

Inapplicability of Maryland Law Limiting Certain Changes in Control

Certain provisions of Maryland law applicable to
real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” (including
certain issuances of equity securities) with any person who beneficially owns
ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities, or with an
affiliate who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in
question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power
of the trust’s outstanding voting securities (an “Interested Shareholder”), or
with an affiliate of an Interested Shareholder. These prohibitions last for
five years after the most recent date on which the Interested Shareholder
became an Interested Shareholder. After the five-year period, a business
combination with an Interested Shareholder must be approved by two
super-majority shareholder votes unless, among other conditions, holders of
common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is
received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the Interested
Shareholder for its common shares. As permitted by Maryland law, however, the
Board of Trustees of the Company has opted out of these restrictions with
respect to any business combination involving Mr. Zell and certain of his
affiliates and persons acting in concert with them. Consequently, the five-year
prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to a business
combination involving us and/or any of them. Such business combinations may not
be in the best interest of our security holders.

Our Success as a REIT is Dependent on Compliance with Federal Income
Tax Requirements

Our Failure to Qualify as a REIT Would Have Serious Adverse
Consequences to Our Security Holders

We believe that we have qualified for taxation as a
REIT for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended December 31,
1992 based, in part, upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have
issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions. We plan
to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these
requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. We cannot, therefore,
guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a REIT. The
determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual
matters that may not be totally within our control. For example, to
qualify as a REIT, our gross income must generally come from rental and other
real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. We
are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90% of our REIT
taxable income excluding capital gains. The fact that we hold our assets
through ERP Operating Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries further
complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or
inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, Congress and
the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts
might issue new rulings that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to
remain qualified as a REIT. We do not believe, however, that any pending or
proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our REIT status.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject
to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS granted
us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a
REIT for four years following the year we first failed to qualify. If we fail
to qualify as a REIT, we would have to pay significant income taxes. We,
therefore, would have less money available for investments or for distributions
to security holders. This would likely have a significant adverse affect on the
value of our securities. In addition, we would no longer be required to make
any distributions to security holders. Even if we quality as a REIT, we are and
will continue to be subject to certain federal,


state
and local taxes on our income and property. In addition, our third party
management operations, corporate housing business and condominium conversion
business, which are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, generally will
be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.

We could be Disqualified as a REIT or Have to Pay Taxes if Our Merger
Partners Did Not Qualify as REITs

If any of our prior merger partners had failed to
qualify as a REIT throughout the duration of their existence, then they might
have had undistributed “C corporation earnings and profits” at the time of
their merger with us. If that was the case and we did not distribute those
earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took
place, we might not qualify as a REIT. We believe based, in part, upon opinions
of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as
well as our own investigations, among other things, that each of our prior
merger partners qualified as a REIT and that, in any event, none of them had
any undistributed “C corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their
merger with us. If any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a
REIT, an additional concern would be that they would have recognized taxable
gain at the time they were merged with us. We would be liable for the tax on
such gain. In this event, we would have to pay corporate income tax on any gain
existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger
if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger. Finally, we could be
precluded from electing REIT status for up to four years after the year in
which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for REIT status.

Compliance with REIT Distribution Requirements May Affect Our
Financial Condition

Distribution Requirements May Increase the
Indebtedness of the Company

We may be required from time to time, under
certain circumstances, to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent
earned but not yet received. In such event, or upon our repayment of principal
on debt, we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to
meet the distribution requirements of a REIT. Accordingly, we could be required
to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet
these distribution requirements.

Federal Income Tax Considerations

General

The following discussion summarizes the federal
income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares. It is not
exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. For example, it does not give a
detailed discussion of any state, local or foreign tax considerations. The
following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be
relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances.
Moreover, it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to
shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws, such as
insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or
broker-dealers, foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or
residents of the United States.

The specific tax attributes of a particular
shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated
with the purchase, ownership and disposition of common shares. Therefore, it is
essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax
advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the
shareholder’s personal tax situation, as well as any tax consequences arising
under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

The information in this section is based on the
current Internal Revenue Code, current, temporary and proposed Treasury
regulations, the legislative history of the Internal Revenue Code, current
administrative interpretations and practices of the Internal Revenue Service,
including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings,
which are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service, and


existing
court decisions. Future legislation, regulations, administrative
interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely
affect existing interpretations of current law. Any change could apply
retroactively. Thus, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could
challenge the statements in this discussion, which do not bind the Internal
Revenue Service or the courts, and that a court could agree with the Internal
Revenue Service.

Our Taxation

We elected REIT status beginning with the year that
ended December 31, 1992. In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, we
generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT
taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders. This
treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most
corporations, which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to
shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive. We elected
taxable REIT subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries,
primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities. As a
result, we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities performed by
our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

We will be subject to federal income tax at regular
corporate rates upon our REIT taxable income or capital gain that we do not
distribute to our shareholders. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% excise
tax if we do not satisfy specific REIT distribution requirements. We could also
be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference. In
addition, any net income from “prohibited transactions” (i.e., dispositions of
property, other than property held by a taxable REIT subsidiary, held primarily
for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business) will be subject to a
100% tax. We could also be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain payments
received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable REIT subsidiary if
any such transaction is not respected by the Internal Revenue Service. If we
fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test
(described below) but have maintained our qualification as a REIT because we
satisfied certain other requirements, we will still generally be subject to a
100% penalty tax on the amount by which we fail such gross income test. If we
fail to satisfy any of the REIT asset tests (described below) by more than a

de minimis

amount, due to reasonable cause, and we
nonetheless maintain our REIT qualification because of specified cure
provisions, we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or
the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the
non-qualifying assets. If we fail to satisfy any provision of the Internal
Revenue Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT (other than
a violation of the REIT gross income or asset tests described below) and the
violation is due to reasonable cause, we may retain our REIT qualification
but we will be required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. Moreover,
we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain
transactions that we do not presently contemplate.

We believe that we have qualified as a REIT for all
of our taxable years beginning with 1992. We also believe that our current
structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a
REIT. However, given the complexity of the REIT qualification requirements, we
cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have
satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the Internal Revenue Code for
a particular year.

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any
taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply, we will
be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We also may be
subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax.” As a result, our failure to
qualify as a REIT would significantly reduce the cash we have available to
distribute to our shareholders. Unless entitled to statutory relief, we would
be disqualified as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during
which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether we would be
entitled to statutory relief.

Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on
our ability to satisfy various requirements


under
the Internal Revenue Code. We are required to satisfy these requirements on a
continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results. Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a
manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT.

Ownership of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries By Us

. The Internal Revenue Code provides that for
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, REITs may own
greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of “taxable
REIT subsidiaries” or “TRSs”, which are corporations subject to tax as a
regular “C” corporation that have elected, jointly with a REIT, to be a TRS. Generally,
a taxable REIT subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by
a REIT and can perform impermissible tenant services (discussed above),
which would otherwise taint our rental income under the REIT income tests. However,
the REIT will be obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that we
receive or on certain expenses deducted by our TRSs if the economic
arrangements between us, our tenants and the TRS are not comparable to similar
arrangements among unrelated parties. A TRS may also receive income from
prohibited transactions without incurring the 100% federal income tax liability
imposed to REITs. Income from prohibited transactions may include the
purchase and sale of land, the purchase and sale of completed development
properties and the sale of condominium units.

TRSs pay federal and state income tax at the full
applicable corporate rates. The amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant
services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount. The
TRSs will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes, but we cannot
guarantee whether or the extent to which, measures taken to minimize these
taxes will be successful. To the extent that these companies are required to
pay taxes, less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders.

Share Ownership Test and Organizational Requirement

.

In order to qualify as a REIT, our shares of
beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335
days of a taxable year that is 12 months, or during a proportionate part of
a taxable year of less than 12 months. Also, not more than 50% in value of our
shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by
applying certain constructive ownership rules, by five or fewer individuals
during the last half of each taxable year. In addition, we must meet certain
other organizational requirements, including, but not limited to, that (i) the
beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and (ii) we
are managed by one or more trustees. We believe that we have satisfied all of
these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue
to do so in the future. In order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test
and the 50% share ownership test discussed above, we have placed certain
restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further
concentration of share ownership. However, such restrictions may not
prevent us from failing these requirements, and thereby failing to qualify as a
REIT.

Gross Income Tests

. To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two
gross income tests:

(1)

At least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived
directly or indirectly from rents from real property, investments in real
estate and/or real estate mortgages, dividends paid by another REIT and from
some types of temporary investments.

(2)

At least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived
from any combination of income qualifying under the 75% test and dividends,
non-real estate mortgage interest, some payments under hedging instruments and
gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities.

To qualify as rents from real property for the
purpose of satisfying the gross income tests, rental payments must generally be
received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the
resident. Also, the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15%
of the total rent. We may generally provide services to residents without “tainting”
our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered”
in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible
services”. If such services are impermissible, then we may generally
provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount, or are provided
through an independent contractor


from
whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements, or through a
taxable REIT subsidiary. We believe that services provided to residents by us
either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of
real property and not otherwise considered impermissible, or, if considered
impermissible services, will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an
independent contractor or taxable REIT subsidiary. However, we cannot provide
any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with these
positions.

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross
income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT
for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code. In this case, a penalty tax would still be applicable as
discussed above. Generally, it is not possible to state whether in all
circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and
in the event these relief provisions do not apply, we will not qualify as a
REIT.

Asset Tests

. In general, at the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must
satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets:

(1)

At least 75% of the value of our total assets
must be represented by real estate assets (which include for this purpose
shares in other real estate investment trusts) and certain cash related items;

(2)

Not more than 25% of our total assets may be
represented by securities other than those in the 75% asset class;

(3)

Except for equity investments in other REITs,
qualified REIT subsidiaries (i.e., corporations owned 100% by a REIT that are
not TRSs or REITs), or taxable REIT subsidiaries: (a) the value of any one
issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our
total assets and (b) we may not own more than 10% of the value of or
the voting securities of any one issuer; and

(4)

Not more than 20% of our total assets may be
represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries.

The 10% value test described in clause (b) of
(3) above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor
under the Code. Under the safe harbor, the following are not considered
"securities" held by us for purposes of this 10% value test: (i)
straight debt securities, (ii) any loan of an individual or an estate, (iii)
certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property, (iv) any obligation
to pay rents from real property, (v) any security issued by a state or any
political subdivision thereof, foreign government or Puerto Rico only if the determination
of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another
entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity, or (vi) any
security issued by a REIT. The timing and payment of interest or principal on a
security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided
that (A) such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity, not
considering a

de minimis

change which does not
exceed the greater of 1/4 of 1% or 5% of the annual yield to maturity or we own
$1,000,000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular
issuer's debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required
to be prepaid or (B) the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and
the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment
right by the issuer of the debt. If we hold indebtedness from any issuer,
including a REIT, the indebtedness will be subject to, and may cause a
violation of, the asset tests, unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or
otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor. We currently own equity
interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as REITs for
federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded. If any such entity
were to fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not meet the 10% voting stock
limitation and the 10% value limitation and we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
We believe that we and each of the REITs we own an interest in have and will
comply with the foregoing asset tests for REIT qualification. However, we
cannot provide any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with
our determinations.

For taxable years commencing on or after January 1,
2005, if we fail to satisfy the 5% or 10% asset tests described above after a 30-day
cure period provided in the Internal Revenue Code, we will be deemed to have
met such tests if the value of our non-qualifying assets is

de minimis

(i.e., does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the
total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or $10,000,000)
and we dispose of the non-qualifying assets within six months after the last
day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is
discovered. For violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that
are in excess of the

de minimis

exception described above, we may avoid disqualification as a REIT under
any of the asset tests, after the 30-day cure period, by disposing of
sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period, paying a
tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate
multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets and
disclosing certain information to the Internal Revenue Service. If we cannot
avail ourselves of these relief provisions, or if we fail to timely cure any
noncompliance with the asset tests, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.

Annual Distribution Requirements

. To qualify as a REIT, we are generally
required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to our
shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90% of our REIT taxable
income. These distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which
they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file
our tax return for the prior year and


if
paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration
is made. We intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our
annual distribution requirements. To the extent that we do not distribute all
of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our
REIT taxable income, as adjusted, we are subject to tax on these amounts at
regular corporate rates.  We will be
subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the
sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal
income tax was paid, if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at
least the sum of:  (1) 85% of our
REIT ordinary income for the year; (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net
income for the year; and (3) any undistributed taxable income from prior
taxable years. A REIT may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a
portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains. In that case, a
REIT may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share
of the undistributed net capital gains in income as long-term capital gains and
receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the REIT. For purposes of
the 4% excise tax described above, any retained amounts would be treated as
having been distributed.

Ownership of Partnership Interests By Us

. As a result of our ownership of the
Operating Partnership, we will be considered to own and derive our
proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the Operating
Partnership, respectively, for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests,
including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are
partnerships or limited liability companies.

State and Local Taxes

. We may be subject to state or local
taxation in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact
business or reside. Our state and local tax treatment may not conform to
the federal income tax treatment discussed above. Consequently, prospective
shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of
state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares.

Taxation of Domestic Shareholders
Subject to U.S. Tax

General

. If we qualify as a REIT, distributions made to our taxable domestic
shareholders with respect to their common shares, other than capital gain
distributions and distributions attributable to taxable REIT subsidiaries, will
be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of
earnings and profits. These distributions will not be eligible for the
dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will
they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the Internal Revenue Code,
meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to
ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates applicable to
qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable
holding period requirements. In determining whether distributions are out of
earnings and profits, we will allocate our earnings and profits first to
preferred shares and second to the common shares. The portion of ordinary
dividends, made after December 31, 2002, which represent ordinary
dividends we receive from a TRS, will be designated as “qualified dividend
income” to REIT shareholders and are eligible for preferential tax rates if
paid to our non-corporate shareholders.

To the extent we make distributions to our taxable
domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits, such distributions
will be considered a return of capital. Such distributions will be treated as a
tax-free distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common
shares by the amount of the distribution so treated. To the extent such
distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis;
such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of shares. Shareholders may not
include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses
or capital losses.

Dividends declared by a REIT in October, November,
or December are deemed to have been paid by the REIT and received by its
shareholders on December 31 of that year, so long as the dividends are
actually paid during January of the following year.  However, this treatment only applies to the
extent of the REIT’s earnings and profits existing on December 31. To the
extent the shareholder distribution paid in January exceeds available
earnings and profits as of December 31, the excess is treated as a
distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid. As such, for tax
reporting purposes, January distributions paid to


our
shareholders may be split between two tax years.

Distributions made by us that we properly designate
as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as
gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year. This
treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not
exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year. It applies regardless
of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common
shares. Despite this general rule, corporate shareholders may be required
to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income.

Generally, we will classify a portion of our designated
capital gain dividends as a 15% rate gain distribution and the remaining
portion as an unrecaptured Section 1250 gain distribution.  A 15% rate gain distribution would be taxable
to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts at a
maximum rate of 15%. An unrecaptured Section 1250 gain distribution would
be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals, estates or
trusts at a maximum rate of 25%.

If, for any taxable year, we elect to designate as
capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for
the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest, then the
portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of
common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction.
The numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made
available to the holders of the common shares for the year. The denominator of
the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of
all classes of shares of beneficial interest.

We may elect to retain (rather than distribute
as is generally required) net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the
income tax on that gain. If we make this election, shareholders must include in
income, as long-term capital gain, their proportionate share of the
undistributed net capital gain. Shareholders will be treated as having paid
their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains. Accordingly,
they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount. Shareholders will
increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount
of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are
treated as having paid. Our earnings and profits will be adjusted
appropriately.

In general, a shareholder will recognize gain or
loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common
shares in an amount equal to the difference between:

(a)

the amount of cash and the fair market value
of any property received in the sale or other disposition; and

(b)

the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the
common shares.

The gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the
common shares were held as a capital asset. Generally, the capital gain or loss
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more
than one year.

In general, a loss recognized by a shareholder upon
the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less, determined
after applying certain holding period rules, will be treated as long-term
capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that
were treated as long-term capital gains. For shareholders who are individuals,
trusts and estates, the long-term capital loss will be apportioned among the
applicable long-term capital gain rates to the extent that distributions
received by the shareholder were previously so treated.

Taxation of Domestic Tax-Exempt
Shareholders

Most tax-exempt organizations are not subject to
federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable
income, which is often referred to as UBTI. Unless a tax-exempt shareholder
holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in
an unrelated trade or


business,
distributions to the shareholder should not constitute UBTI. Similarly, if a
tax-exempt shareholder sells common shares, the income from the sale should not
constitute UBTI unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed
property or used the shares in a trade or business.

However, for tax-exempt shareholders that are social
clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment
benefit trusts, and qualified group legal services plans, income from owning or
selling common shares will constitute UBTI unless the organization is able to
properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the
income generated by its investment in common shares. These shareholders should
consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve
requirements which are set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.

In addition, certain pension trusts that own more
than 10% of a “pension-held REIT” must report a portion of the distributions
that they receive from the REIT as UBTI. We have not been and do not expect to
be treated as a pension-held REIT for purposes of this rule.

Taxation of Foreign Shareholders

The following is a discussion of certain anticipated
United States federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition
of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder. For purposes of this
discussion, a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than:

(a)

a citizen or resident of the United States;

(b)

a corporation or partnership created or
organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States or of any
state thereof; or

(c)

an estate or trust whose income is includable
in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its
source.

Distributions by Us

. Distributions by us to a foreign
shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us
of United States real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains
dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that
they are made out of our earnings and profits. These distributions ordinarily
will be subject to withholding of United States federal income tax on a gross
basis at a 30% rate, or a lower treaty rate, unless the dividends are treated
as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a
United States trade or business. Please note that under certain treaties lower
withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends
from REITs. Dividends that are effectively connected with a United States trade
or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates, and are
generally not subject to withholding. Certification and disclosure requirements
must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this
exemption. A foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject
to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or a lower treaty rate.

We expect to withhold United States income tax at
the rate of 30% on any distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless:

(a)

a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or
certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder files an IRS Form W-8ECI
with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income.

A distribution in excess of our current or
accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder
to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the
shareholder’s common shares. Instead, the distribution will reduce the adjusted
basis of the common


shares.
To the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common
shares, it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s
common shares. The tax treatment of this gain is described below.

We intend to withhold at a rate of 30%, or a lower
applicable treaty rate, on the entire amount of any distribution not designated
as a capital gain distribution. In such event, a foreign shareholder may seek
a refund of the withheld amount from the IRS if it subsequently determined that
the distribution was, in fact, in excess of our earnings and profits, and the
amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s United States tax liability
with respect to the distribution.

From and after the taxable year ending
December 31, 2005, any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our
stock which is "regularly traded" on an established securities
market, will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above, if the foreign
shareholder did not own more than 5% of such class of stock at any time during
the taxable year. Foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report
distributions received from us on U.S. federal income tax returns and all
distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
including any capital gain dividends, will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding
tax (unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty), as
described above. In addition, the branch profits tax will no longer apply to
such distributions.

Distributions to a foreign shareholder that we
designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends, other
than those arising from the disposition of a United States real property
interest, generally will not be subject to United States federal income
taxation unless:

(a)

the investment in the common shares is
effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s United States trade or
business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same
treatment as domestic shareholders, except that a shareholder that is a foreign
corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax, as discussed
above; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder is a nonresident
alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more
during the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the United States, in which
case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the
individual’s capital gains.

Except as described above, under the Foreign
Investment in Real Property Tax Act, which is known as FIRPTA, distributions to
a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of
United States real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be
treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a United
States trade or business. This rule applies whether or not a distribution
is designated as a capital gain dividend. Accordingly, foreign shareholders
generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to
U.S. shareholders, subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of
nonresident alien individuals. In addition, a foreign corporate shareholder
might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above. We are required to
withhold 35% of these distributions. The withheld amount can be credited
against the foreign shareholder’s United States federal income tax liability.

Although the law is not entirely clear on the
matter, it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in
respect of the common shares held by U.S. shareholders would be treated with
respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of
capital gain dividends. Under that approach, foreign shareholders would be able
to offset as a credit against the United States federal income tax liability
their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital
gains. In addition, foreign shareholders would be able to receive from the IRS
a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to
exceed their actual United States federal income tax liability.

Foreign Shareholders’ Sales of Common Shares

. Gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the
sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to United
States taxation unless the shares constitute a “United States real property
interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA. The common shares will not constitute a
United States real property interest so long as we are a domestically
controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times
during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its stock is held
directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders. We believe that we are a
domestically controlled REIT. Therefore, we believe that the sale of common
shares will not be subject to taxation under FIRPTA. However, because common
shares and preferred shares are publicly traded, we cannot guarantee that we
will continue to be a domestically controlled REIT. In any event, gain from the
sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to FIRPTA will be
subject to U.S. tax, if


either:

(a)

the investment in the common shares is
effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s United States trade or
business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same
treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder is a nonresident
alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more
during the taxable year and has a tax home in the United States, in which case
the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual’s
capital gains.

Even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a
domestically controlled REIT, gain arising from the sale or exchange by a
foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to United
States taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a United States real property
interest if:

(a)

the class or series of shares being
sold is “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable IRS regulations, on an
established securities market such as the New York Stock Exchange; and

(b)

the selling foreign shareholder owned 5% or
less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being
sold throughout the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or
exchange.

If gain on the sale or exchange of common shares
were subject to taxation under FIRPTA, the foreign shareholder would be subject
to regular United States income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner
as a taxable U.S. shareholder, subject to any applicable alternative minimum
tax, a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien
individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case
of foreign corporations. The purchaser of the common shares would be required
to withhold and remit to the IRS 10% of the purchase price.

Information Reporting Requirement
and Backup Withholding

We will report to our domestic shareholders and the
Internal Revenue Service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar
year and the amount of tax withheld, if any. Under certain circumstances,
domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding. Backup
withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish
certain information to us or the Internal Revenue Service. Backup withholding
will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such
as corporations and tax-exempt organizations. Domestic shareholders should
consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from
backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup
withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed
as a credit against such person’s United States federal income tax liability
and may entitle such person to a refund, provided that the required
information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

Item
2.  Properties

As of December 31,
2005, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding
entities, owned all or a portion of 926 properties in 31 states and the
District of Columbia consisting of 197,404 units.  The Company’s properties are more fully
described as follows:

Resident leases are
generally for twelve months in length and typically require security
deposits.  The garden-style properties
are generally defined as properties with two and/or three story buildings while
the mid-rise/high-rise are defined as properties with greater than three story
buildings.  These two property types
typically provide residents with amenities, which may include a clubhouse,
swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television access. Certain of these
properties offer additional amenities such as saunas, whirlpools, spas, sports
courts and exercise rooms or other amenities. 
The ranch-style properties are defined as single story properties, which
do not provide additional amenities for residents other than laundry facilities
and cable television access.  The
military housing properties are defined as those properties located on military
bases.

It is management’s role to monitor compliance with
property policies and to provide preventive maintenance of the properties
including common areas, facilities and amenities.  The Company has a dedicated training and
education department that creates and coordinates training and strategic
implementation for the Company’s property management personnel.  The Company believes that, due in part to its
emphasis on training and employee quality, the properties historically have had
high occupancy rates.

The distribution of the properties throughout the
United States reflects the Company’s belief that geographic diversification
helps insulate the portfolio from regional and economic influences.  At the same time, the Company has sought to
create clusters of properties within each of its primary markets in order to achieve
economies of scale in management and operation. 
The Company may nevertheless acquire additional multifamily properties
located anywhere in the continental United States.

The following tables set
forth certain information by type and state relating to the Company’s
properties (occupancy information excludes condominium conversion, development
and unstabilized acquired properties) at December 31, 2005:


GARDEN-STYLE PROPERTIES


MID-RISE/HIGH RISE PROPERTIES

RANCH-STYLE PROPERTIES

MILITARY
HOUSING PROPERTIES


The properties currently in various stages of
development at December 31, 2005 are included in the following table.

CONSOLIDATED
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS as of December 31, 2005

(Amounts in
thousands except for project and unit amounts)

(1)  Total capital cost represents estimated
development cost for projects under development and all capitalized costs
incurred to date plus any estimates of costs remaining to be funded for all
completed projects.

(2)  Of the total book value to date, $83.8 million
has been transferred to land and depreciable property and $224.8 million is
currently reflected as construction in progress (“CIP”). The remaining $180.5
million of CIP represents land held for future development and related costs
and land and related development costs for uncompleted condominium
projects.  Of the $242.6 million
remaining to be invested, $55.5 million will be funded through third party
construction mortgages.

(3) Projects are wholly owned.  All others are partially owned.


Item
3.  Legal Proceedings

The Company tried a class action lawsuit in Palm
Beach County, Florida during the last week of August of 2004 which
challenged the assessment and collection of certain lease termination fees.  The case has been settled, subject to court
approval.  The Company will pay $1.7
million into a class fund, $1.629 million of which was previously accrued
during 2004.  In addition, the Company
will pay $325,000 to reimburse class counsel for its out of pocket expenses,
plus $2.55 million in attorney’s fees. 
Costs of claims administration will be approximately $100,000.  An accrual for these additional potential
payments was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005.  Preliminary court approval of the settlement
was obtained in February 2006 and final judgment is expected in the second
quarter of 2006.

The Company does not believe there is any other
litigation pending or threatened against the Company which, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably may be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Company.

Selected Financial Data

The following table sets
forth selected financial and operating information on a historical basis for
the Company.  The following information
should be read in conjunction with all of the financial statements and notes
thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  The historical operating and balance sheet
data have been derived from the historical financial statements of the
Company.  All amounts have also been
restated in accordance with the discontinued operations provisions of SFAS No. 144.  Certain capitalized terms as used herein are
defined in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


CONSOLIDATED
HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

(Financial
information in thousands except for per share and property data)

(1)

The National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from operations (“FFO”) (April 2002 White
Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)), excluding gains (or losses)
from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and
after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships
and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the
same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales
of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating
properties only.  Once the Company
commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously
discontinues depreciation of such property.


See Item 7
for a reconciliation of net income to FFO.

(2)

The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors
as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate
company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate
industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of
depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary
among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost
accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating
performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to
different companies.  FFO in and of
itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating
activities in accordance with GAAP. 
Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to
net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP
or as a measure of liquidity.  The
Company’s calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due
to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital
expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate
companies.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The following discussion and
analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company
should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
Notes thereto. Due to the Company’s ability to control the Operating
Partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning interests in the
Unconsolidated Properties and certain other entities in which the Company has
investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been
consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.  Capitalized terms used herein and not defined
are as defined elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2005.

Forward-looking statements
in this Item 7 as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are
intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
These statements are based on current expectations, estimates,
projections and assumptions made by management. 
While the Company’s management believes the assumptions underlying its
forward-looking statements are reasonable, such information is inherently
subject to uncertainties and may involve certain risks, which could cause
actual results, performance, or achievements of the Company to differ
materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Many of these uncertainties and risks are
difficult to predict and beyond management’s control.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees
of future performance, results or events. 
The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement
forward-looking statements because of subsequent events. Factors that might
cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

We
intend to actively acquire and develop multifamily properties for rental
operations and/or conversion into condominiums, as well as upgrade and sell
existing properties as individual condominiums. 
We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired or
condominium conversion property up to standards established for its intended
market position or to otherwise develop a property.  Additionally, we expect that other major real
estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive
investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we
focus our development efforts.  This
competition may increase prices for multifamily properties or decrease the
price at which we expect to sell individual condominiums.  Upon conversion of properties to
condominiums, we have increased our risk related to construction performed
during the conversion.  Condominium
associations may assert that the construction performed was defective,
resulting in litigation and/or settlement discussions.  We may not be in a position or have the
opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable
terms.  We also plan to develop more
properties ourselves in addition to co-investing with our development partners
for either the rental or condominium market, depending on opportunities in each
sub-market.  This may increase the
overall level of risk associated with our developments.  The total number of development units, cost
of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties
arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and
construction materials), competition and local government regulation.


•

Sources
of capital to the Company or labor and materials required for maintenance,
repair, capital expenditure or development are more expensive than anticipated;

•

Occupancy
levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local
economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new construction
of multifamily housing, slow employment growth, availability of low interest
mortgages for single-family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical
instability, all of which are beyond the Company’s control; and

•

Additional
factors as discussed in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
particularly those under “Risk Factors”.

Readers are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as
of the date hereof.  The Company
undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking
statements, which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date
hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  Forward-looking statements and related
uncertainties are also included in Note 5 and 11 to the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in this report.

Results of Operations

In conjunction with our business objectives and
operating strategy, the Company has continued to invest or recycle its capital
investment in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets
during the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.  In summary, we:

Year Ended December 31, 2005:

•

Acquired
$2.5 billion of apartment properties consisting of forty-one properties and
12,059 units, and $138.3 million of land parcels, all of which we deem to be in
our strategic targeted markets; and

•

Sold
$1.4 billion of apartment properties consisting of 50 properties and 12,848
units, as well as 2,241 condominium units for $593.3 million and five land
parcels for $108.3 million.

Year Ended December 31, 2004:

•

Acquired
$900.8 million of apartment properties consisting of twenty-four properties and
6,182 units, as well as $12.4 million of land parcels; and

•

Sold
$787.8 million of apartment properties consisting of fifty-six properties and
14,159 units as well as 977 condominium units for $177.3 million and two land
parcels for $27.9 million.

The
Company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment
communities is net operating income (“NOI”). 
NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real
estate tax and insurance expense, and property management expense.  The Company believes that NOI is helpful to
investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real
estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results
of the Company’s apartment communities.

Properties that the Company owned for all of both
2005 and 2004 (the “2005 Same Store Properties”), which represented 154,854
units, impacted the Company’s results of operations.  Properties that the Company owned for all of
both 2004 and 2003 (the “2004 Same Store Properties”), which represented
162,201 units, also impacted the Company’s results of operations.  Both the 2005 Same Store Properties and 2004 Same
Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs.

The Company’s acquisition, disposition,
completed development and consolidation of previously unconsolidated property
and variable interest entity activities also impacted overall results of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.  The impacts of these activities are also
discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.


Comparison of the year ended December 31,
2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004

For the year ended December 31,
2005, income from continuing operations increased by approximately $34.7
million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2004.  The increase in continuing operations is
discussed below.

Revenues from the 2005 Same Store
Properties increased $61.9 million primarily as a result of lower concessions
provided residents and a slight increase in average rent per unit and occupancy
rates.  Expenses from the 2005 Same Store
Properties increased $36.2 million primarily due to higher payroll, utility
costs and real estate taxes.  The
following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, NOI and weighted average
occupancy for the 2005 Same Store Properties:

expenses exclude $11.1 million of uninsured property damage caused by Hurricane
Wilma.  Year 2004 expenses exclude $15.2
million of uninsured property damage caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances,
Ivan and Jeanne.

The
following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the
consolidated statements of operations to NOI for the 2005 Same Store
Properties.

(1) Hurricane property damage net of reimbursement from insurance
company.


For
properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2005 and expects
to continue to own through December 31, 2006, the Company anticipates the
following same store results for the full year ending December 31, 2006:

These
2006 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.

Non-same
store operating results increased $78.6 million and consist primarily of
properties acquired in calendar years 2005 and 2004 as well as our corporate
housing business.

Fee and asset management
revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, decreased by $1.7 million
primarily as a result of lower income earned from Ft. Lewis and managing fewer
properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities.  As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
Company managed 16,269 units and
17,988 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities.

Property
management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses
associated with the self-management of the Company’s properties as well as
management fees paid to any third party management companies.  These expenses increased by approximately
$7.2 million or 9.4%.  This increase is
primarily attributable to higher overall payroll costs including bonuses,
long-term compensation costs and an increase of the Company’s match for
employee 401(k) contributions.

Depreciation expense from
continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets,
increased $62.8 million primarily as a result of additional depreciation
expense on newly acquired properties and capital expenditures for all properties
owned.

General and administrative
expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately
$22.5 million between the periods under comparison.  This increase was primarily due to higher
executive compensation expense due to severance costs of $9.8 million for
several executive officers, $7.9 million of additional accruals specific to
performance shares for selected executive officers and a $2.5 million profit
sharing accrual to be paid in the first quarter of 2006.  The Company anticipates that general and
administrative expenses will approximate $50.0 million for the year ending December 31,
2006.  The above assumption is based on
current expectations and is forward-looking.

Interest
and other income from continuing operations increased approximately $59.6

million,
primarily as a result of the $57.1 million in cash received for the Company’s
ownership interest in Rent.com, which was acquired by eBay, Inc.

Interest expense from
continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs,
increased approximately $56.2 million
primarily as a result of higher overall debt balances as well as higher
variable interest rates.  During the year
ended December 31, 2005, the Company capitalized interest costs of
approximately $13.7 million as compared to $14.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2004.  This capitalization of interest
primarily relates to consolidated projects under development.  The effective interest cost on all
indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 6.16% as compared to
5.87% for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Income (loss) from investments
in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $7.8 million between the
periods under comparison.  This increase
is primarily the result of consolidation of properties that were previously
unconsolidated in the first quarter of 2004.

Net gain on sales of
unconsolidated entities decreased $3.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in


the number of unconsolidated entities sold.

Net gain on sales of land
parcels increased $24.8 million, primarily due to an increase in the number of
land parcels sold and large gains recorded on two land parcels located in Tyson’s
Corner, Virginia.

Net gain on sales of
discontinued operations increased approximately $379.2 million between the
periods under comparison.  This increase
is primarily the result of higher per unit sales prices and lower real estate
net book values for properties sold during the year ended December 31,
2005 as compared to the same period in 2004 as well as higher condominium
sales.  The Company recognized $91.6
million and $32.1 million of net incremental gain on sales of condominium units
(net of provision for income taxes) for the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

Discontinued operations, net,
decreased approximately $24.4 million between the periods under
comparison.  The decrease in revenues and
expenses between periods results from the timing, size and number of properties
sold.  Any property sold after December 31,
2004 will include a full period’s results in the year ended December 31,
2004 but minimal to no results in the year ended December 31, 2005.  See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion.

Comparison of the year ended December 31,
2004 to the year ended December 31, 2003

For the year ended December 31,
2004, income from continuing operations decreased by approximately $5.5 million
when compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the reasons noted
below.

Revenues from the 2004 Same Store
Properties increased $14.1 million primarily as a result of lower concessions
provided residents and a slight increase in occupancy rates.  Expenses from the 2004 Same Store Properties
increased $22.5 million primarily due to higher payroll, utility costs and real
estate taxes.  The following tables
provide comparative revenue, expense, NOI and weighted average occupancy for
the 2004 Same Store Properties:

Year 2004
  vs. Year 2003

Year over Year Same-Store Results

$ in Millions – 162,201 Same-Store Units

(1)

Year 2004 expenses exclude
$15.2 million of uninsured property damage caused by Hurricanes Charley,
Frances, Ivan and Jeanne.

Non-same
store operating results are primarily from newly acquired properties not yet
included as 2004 Same Store Properties and the consolidation of all previously
unconsolidated development projects.


Fee and asset management
revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, decreased by $4.2 million
primarily as a result of lower income earned from Ft. Lewis and managing fewer
properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities.  As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
Company managed 17,988 units and
18,475 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities.

Property
management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses
associated with the self-management of the Company’s properties as well as
management fees paid to any third party management companies.  These expenses increased by approximately
$7.0 million or 10.1%.  This increase is
primarily attributable to higher payroll costs, including bonuses and long-term
compensation costs as well as severance costs for certain employees.  In addition, the property management company
experienced slightly higher costs for travel, temporary help, internal
conferences and legal and professional fees.

Depreciation expense from
continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets,
increased $62.4 million primarily as a result of the consolidation of
previously unconsolidated projects and properties acquired after December 31,
2003, many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than
properties previously acquired, and also due to additional depreciation on
capital expenditures for all properties owned.

General and administrative
expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately
$12.3 million between the periods under comparison.  This increase was primarily due to the costs
of consulting services rendered to increase operating efficiencies and
increased litigation and internal control costs partially offset by $1.4
million of immediate expense recognition related to options granted in the
first quarter of 2003 to the Company’s former chief executive officer.   Consulting services were contracted to
enhance resident satisfaction/retention, unit pricing and expense
procurement/reduction.

The Company recorded impairment
charges on its technology investments of approximately $1.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003.  See
Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Interest
and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately $6.6

million,
primarily as a result of lower balances available for investments including
deposits in tax deferred exchange accounts and collateral agreements related to
development projects.

Interest expense from
continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs,
increased approximately $12.7 million.  This increase was primarily attributable to
increases in mortgage and unsecured note balances and lower capitalized
interest.  During the year ended December 31,
2004, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $14.0 million as
compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.  This capitalization of interest primarily
related to equity investments in Partially Owned Properties (consolidated)
engaged in development activities.  The
effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31,
2004 was 5.87% as compared to 6.36% for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Loss from investments in
unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $2.8 million between the
periods under comparison.  This decrease
is primarily the result of consolidation of properties that were previously unconsolidated,
partially offset by an increase in realized losses on the settlement of
derivative instruments.

Net gain on sales of
discontinued operations increased approximately $7.7 million between the
periods under comparison.  This increase
is primarily the result of an increase in the number of condominium units sold.

Discontinued operations, net,
decreased approximately $53.2 million between the periods under
comparison.  See Note 13 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

For the Year Ended December 31, 2005

As of January 1, 2005, the
Company had approximately $83.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $484.6
million available under its line of credit (net of $65.4 million which was
restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for
borrowing).  After taking into effect the
various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash
provided by operating activities, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents
balance at December 31, 2005 was approximately $88.8 million and the
amount available on the Company’s revolving credit facilities was $780.8
million (net of $50.2 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters
of credit and not available for borrowing).

During the year ended December 31,
2005, the Company generated proceeds from various transactions, which included
the following:

•

Disposed
of fifty-six properties (including various individual condominium units) and
five land parcels and received net proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion;

•

Obtained
$496.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $500.0 million of ten and
one-half year 5.125% fixed rate public notes;

•

Obtained
$280.1 million in new mortgage financing;

•

Obtained
$57.1 million for its ownership interest in Rent.com;

•

Received
$25.0 million in full redemption of 1,000,000 shares of Wellsford 8.25%
Convertible Trust Preferred Securities; and

•

Issued
approximately 2.5 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $63.1
million.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the above proceeds were
primarily utilized to:

•

Acquire
forty-one properties and seven land parcels (including one additional unit at
one property) utilizing cash of $2.2 billion;

•

Repay
$470.4 million of mortgage loans;

•

Repay
$194.3 million of fixed rate public notes;

•

Redeem
or repurchase the Series B through F Preference Interests at a liquidation
value of $146.0 million;

•

Redeem
the Series B Preferred Shares at a liquidation value of $125.0 million;
and

•

Invest
$180.0 million primarily in development projects.

Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic
conditions, and other opportunities for the investment of available capital,
the Company may repurchase its Common Shares pursuant to its existing share
buyback program authorized by the Board of Trustees.  The Company did not repurchase any of its
Common Shares during the year ended December 31, 2005 but did repurchase
$31.5 million (719,800 shares at an average price per share of $43.76) during February 2006
to offset the issuance of 661,962 OP Units in connection with a property
acquisition and to partially offset restricted shares granted in February 2006
..  The Company is authorized to
repurchase approximately $553.5 million of additional Common Shares.

The Company’s total debt summary and debt maturity schedule as
of December 31, 2005, are as follows:


(1) Net of the effect of any derivative
instruments

(1) Includes $150.0
million of 7.57% unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2026 that is putable
in 2006.  Also includes $215.0 million
outstanding on the Company’s short-term $600.0 million unsecured revolving
credit facility.  This facility was
terminated on January 20, 2006 in conjunction with the Company’s $400.0
million unsecured note issuance which closed on January 19, 2006.

(2) Includes $554.0
million outstanding on the Company’s long-term unsecured revolving credit
facility which matures on May 29, 2008.

As of March 1, 2006,
$580.0 million in debt securities remains available for issuance by the
Operating Partnership under a registration statement the SEC declared effective
in June 2003 and $956.5 million in equity securities remains available for
issuance by the Company under a registration statement the SEC declared
effective in February 1998.

The Company’s “Consolidated
Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization Ratio” as of December 31, 2005 is
presented in the following table.  The
Company calculates the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum
of (i) the total outstanding Common Shares and assumed conversion of all
OP Units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the Company’s
Common Shares on the New York Stock


Exchange; (ii) the “Common Share Equivalent” of
all convertible preferred shares and preference interests/units; and (iii) the
liquidation value of all perpetual preferred shares and preference interests
outstanding.

Convertible
  Preferred Equity as of December 31, 2005

(Amounts in thousands except for share and per share amounts)

Perpetual Preferred Equity as of December 31,

(Amounts in thousands except for share and per share
amounts)

(1)

The Series G and H
Preference Interests were called for redemption on February 10, 2006, to
be effective March 21, 2006 and March 23, 2006, respectively.  See Note 3 in the notes to consolidated
financial statements for additional discussion.

The Company expects to
meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures
related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured
note and mortgage note repayments, generally through its working capital, net
cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit
facilities.  The Company considers its
cash provided by operating activities to be


adequate to meet operating requirements and
payments of distributions.  The Company
also expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled
unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing
of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the
issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities, including additional OP
Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties.  In addition, the Company has significant
unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in
the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of
alternative sources of capital is too high. 
The fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are
in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with
covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit.  Of the $16.6 billion in investment in real
estate on the Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2005, $10.8 billion
or 65.3%, was unencumbered.

As of March 1, 2006, the Operating
Partnership has a revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to
$1.0 billion.    This facility matures in
May 2008 and may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property
acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short term
liquidity requirements.  As of March 1,
2006, $520.0

million was outstanding under
this facility (and $54.8 million was restricted and dedicated to support
letters of credit).

See Note 21 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to December 31,
2005.

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate

Our

policy with respect to
capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the
value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the
property.  We track improvements to real
estate in two major categories and several subcategories:

•

Replacements

(inside the unit)

.  These include:

•

carpets and hardwood
floors;

•

appliances;

•

mechanical equipment such
as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc;

•

furniture and fixtures
such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs,
toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc;

•

flooring such as vinyl,
linoleum or tile; and

•

blinds/shades.

All replacements are
depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life.  We expense as incurred all maintenance and
turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual units and the
repair of any replacement item noted above.

•

Building improvements (

outside the unit

).  These include:

•

roof replacement and major
renovations;

•

paving or major
resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks;

•

amenities and common areas
such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses,
laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices;

•

major building mechanical
equipment systems;

•

interior and exterior
structural repair and exterior painting and siding;

•

major landscaping and
grounds improvement; and

•

vehicles and office and
maintenance equipment.

All building improvements
are depreciated over a five to ten-year estimated useful life.  We expense as incurred all expenditures that
do not improve the value of the asset or extend its useful life.

For the year ended December 31,
2005, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $232.5
million.  This includes the following
detail (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit


amounts):

(1)

Total units exclude 15,899 unconsolidated units.

(2)

Wholly Owned Properties acquired prior to January 1, 2003.

(3)

Wholly Owned Properties acquired during 2003, 2004 and 2005.  Per unit amounts are based on a weighted
average of 20,828 units.

(4)

Includes properties either Partially Owned or sold during the period,
commercial space, condominium conversions and $6.8 million included in building
improvements spent on nine specific assets related to major renovations and
repositioning of these assets.

For the year ended December 31,
2004, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $212.2
million.  This includes the following
detail (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):

Capitalized
  Improvements to Real Estate

For the Year Ended December 31, 2004

(1)

Total units exclude 16,218 unconsolidated units.

(2)

Wholly Owned Properties acquired prior to January 1, 2002.

(3)

Wholly Owned Properties acquired during 2002, 2003 and 2004.  Per unit amounts are based on a weighted
average of 17,577 units.

(4)

Includes properties either Partially Owned or sold during the period,
commercial space, condominium conversions and $6.6 million included in building
improvements spent on fifteen specific assets related to major renovations and
repositioning of these assets.

The Company expects to
fund approximately $170.0

million for capital expenditures for
replacements and building improvements for all consolidated properties, exclusive
of condominium conversion properties, in 2006. 
This includes an average of approximately $1,000 per unit for capital
improvements for established properties.

During the year ended December 31,
2005, the Company’s total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer
software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold
improvements to the Company’s property management offices and its corporate
offices, was approximately $17.6

million.  The


Company expects to fund approximately $10.8
million in total additions to non-real estate property in 2006.

Improvements to real estate and additions to
non-real estate property were funded from net cash provided by operating
activities.

Derivative Instruments

In the
normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest
rate changes.  The Company limits these
risks by following established risk management policies and procedures
including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt
instruments.

The Company
has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions
based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  When viewed in conjunction with the
underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge,
the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does
it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial
position in the future from the use of derivatives.

See Note 11

in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative
instruments at December 31, 2005.

Other

Minority
Interests as of December 31, 2005 decreased by $113.4 million when
compared to December 31, 2004.  The
primary factors that impacted this account in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations and balance sheets during the year ended December 31,
2005 were:

•

The redemption or
repurchase of 2.9 million shares of Series B through F Preference
Interests with a  combined liquidation
value of $146.0 million and a premium on redemption of $4.1 million (see Note 3
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion);

•

Distributions declared to
Minority Interests, which amounted to $36.1 million (excluding Junior
Preference Unit and Preference Interest distributions);

•

The allocation of income
from operations to holders of OP Units in the amount of $58.5 million;

•

The issuance of 956,751 OP
Units valued at $33.7 million at an average price of $35.18 per unit; and

•

The conversion of 1.1
million OP Units into Common Shares valued at $24.2 million at an average price
of $22.29 per unit.

Total distributions paid
in January 2006 amounted to $147.2 million (excluding distributions on
Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared
during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

The Company has
co-invested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for
under the equity method of accounting. 
Management does not believe these investments have a materially
different impact upon the Company’s liquidity, capital resources, credit or
market risk than its property management and ownership activities.  The nature and business purpose of these
ventures are as follows:


•

Institutional
Ventures – During 2000 and 2001, the Company entered into ventures with an
unaffiliated partner.   At the respective
closing dates, the Company sold and/or contributed 45 properties containing
10,846 units to these ventures and retained a 25% ownership interest in the
ventures.  The Company’s joint venture
partner contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed-upon equity value of the
properties comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company.
The Company’s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its
concentration of properties in a variety of markets.

•

Other – As of December 31,
2005, the Company has ownership interests in eleven properties containing 1,360
units acquired in a prior merger.  The
current weighted average ownership percentage is 11.0%.  The Company’s strategy with respect to these
interests is either to acquire a majority ownership or sell the Company’s
interest.

As of December 31,
2005, the Company has six projects totaling 1,760 units in various stages of
development with estimated completion dates ranging through March 31,
2008.  The primary development agreements
currently in place have the following key terms:

•

The first development partner has the right, at any
time following completion of a project subject to the agreement, to stipulate a
value for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the
Company based on such value.  If the
Company chooses not to purchase the interest, it must agree to a sale of the
project to an unrelated third party at such value.  The Company’s partner must exercise this
right as to all projects subject to the agreement within five years after the
receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed
property.   In connection with this
development agreement, the Company has an obligation to provide up to $40.0
million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party
construction financing.  As of the date
of this filing, the Company had no amounts outstanding related to this credit
enhancement.  The Company would be required
to perform under this agreement only if there was a material default under a
third party construction mortgage agreement. 
This agreement expires no later than December 31, 2018.  Notwithstanding the termination of the
agreement, the Company shall have recourse against its development partner for
any losses incurred.

•

The second development partner has the right, at any
time following completion of a project subject to the agreement, to require the
Company to purchase the partners’ interest in that project at a mutually
agreeable price.  If the Company and the
partner are unable to agree on a price, both parties will obtain
appraisals.  If the appraised values vary
by more than 10%, both the Company and its partner will agree on a third
appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination
of value.  The Company may elect at that
time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize its partner to sell
the project at or above the agreed-upon value to an unrelated third party.  Five years following the receipt of the final
certificate of occupancy on the last developed property, the Company must
purchase, at the agreed-upon price, any projects remaining unsold.

•

The third development partner has the exclusive
right for six months following stabilization, as defined, to market a subject
project for sale.  Thereafter, either the
Company or its development partner may market a subject project for sale. If
the Company’s development partner proposes the sale, the Company may elect to
purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale
until two independent appraisers appraise the project.  If the two appraised values vary by more than
5%, a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair market value of the
property.  Once a value has been
determined, the Company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its
development partner to sell the project at the agreed-upon value.

In addition, the Company
has various deal-specific development agreements with partners, the overall
terms of which are similar in nature to those described above.


See Note 6 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the
Company’s investments in unconsolidated entities.

The Company’s guaranty of
a credit enhancement agreement with respect to certain tax-exempt bonds issued
to finance certain public improvements at a multifamily development project was
terminated effective May 2, 2005 as the tax-exempt bonds were redeemed in
full and the associated letter of credit was cancelled.

The
following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations for the next
five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2005:

(a)

Amounts
include aggregate principal payments only. 
The Company paid $397,886, $348,574 and $352,391 for interest on debt,
inclusive of derivative instruments, for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(b)

Minimum basic rent due for
various office space the Company leases and fixed base rent due on a ground
lease for one property.

(c)

Estimated payments to the
Company’s Chairman, two former CEO’s and its chief operating officer based on
planned retirement dates.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

The
Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial
statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2005 and are consistent
with the year ended December 31, 2004.

The Company has identified six significant
accounting policies as critical accounting policies.  These critical accounting policies are those
that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those
requiring significant judgments and estimates. 
With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes
that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and
produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations
for all periods presented.  The six
critical accounting policies are:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill

The Company
periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real
estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent impairment.  The judgments regarding the existence of
impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance,
market conditions, expected holding period of each asset and legal and
environmental concerns.  Future events
could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment
indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.

Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate

The Company
depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30-year
estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5-year to 10-year estimated
useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements
components over a 5-year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental
determinations.


Cost Capitalization

See the

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to
Real Estate

section for discussion of the policy with respect
to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance
costs.  In addition, the Company
capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible
for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and/or
renovation projects.  These costs are reflected
on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.

The Company
follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67,

Accounting
for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects

, for
all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining
whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as
incurred.  The Company capitalizes
interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for
those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on
development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days
following issuance of the certificate of occupancy.  These costs are reflected on the balance
sheet as construction in progress for each specific property.  The Company expenses as incurred all payroll
costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted
above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance
and on specific major renovation at selected properties when additional
incremental employees are hired.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments

The
valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133
and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149) requires the Company to make
estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments.  The Company, where possible, bases the fair
values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on
listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the
Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and
maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.

Revenue Recognition

Rental
income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is
recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a
straight-line basis.  Leases entered into
between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are
generally year-to-year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or
monthly basis.  Fee and asset management
revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company
elected to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123
and its amendment (SFAS No. 148),

Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation

, effective in the first quarter of
2003, which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair
value of the stock compensation granted.

The Company
elected the “Prospective Method” which requires expensing of employee awards
granted or modified after January 1, 2003. 
Compensation expense under all of the Company’s plans is generally
recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years.  See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion and comparative information
regarding application of the fair value method to all outstanding employee
awards.

Funds From Operations

For the year ended December 31,
2005, Funds From Operations (“FFO”) available to Common Shares and OP Units
increased $132.9 million, or 20.4%, as compared to the year ended December 31,
2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, FFO available to Common Shares
and OP Units increased $11.4 million, or 1.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31,
2003.


The following is a reconciliation of net income to
FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003:

(1)

The
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds
from operations (“FFO”) (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States (GAAP)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property,
plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures.  Adjustments
for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to
reflect funds from operations on the same basis.  The April 2002 White Paper states that
gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously
depreciated operating properties only. 
Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it
simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property.

(2)

The
Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of
the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized
measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or
losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real
estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar
condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO
can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between
periods or as compared to different companies. 
FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows
from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.  Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively
considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating
activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity.  The Company’s calculation of FFO may differ
from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost
capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be
comparable to such other real estate companies.


Item 7A.  Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Market risks relating to
the Company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in short-term
LIBOR interest rates.  The Company does
not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk.

The Company’s exposure to
market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured
revolving credit facilities.  The Company
typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and
capital expenditures, while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations
to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of
securing long-term fixed rate financing. 
The Company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with
respect to total debt and other factors, including its assessment of the
current and future economic environment.

The Company also utilizes certain derivative
financial instruments to limit market risk. 
Interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate
debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa. 
Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation.  The Company does not enter into financial
instruments for trading purposes.   See
also Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
discussion of derivative instruments.

The fair values of the Company’s financial
instruments (including such items in the financial statement captions as cash
and cash equivalents, other assets, lines of credit, accounts payable and
accrued expenses, rents received in advance and other liabilities) approximate
their carrying or contract values based on their nature, terms and interest
rates that approximate current market rates. 
The fair value of the Company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured
notes were both approximately $3.6 billion at December 31, 2005.

The Company had total outstanding floating rate debt
of approximately $1.9 billion, or 24.9% of total debt at December 31,
2005, net of the effects of any derivative instruments.  If market rates of interest on all of the
floating rate debt permanently increased by 37 basis points (a 10% increase
from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the increase in
interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and
cash flows by approximately $7.1

million.  If market rates of interest on all of the
floating rate debt permanently decreased by 37 basis points (a 10% decrease
from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in
interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and
cash flows by approximately $7.1

million.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had total
outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $5.7 billion, net of the effects
of any derivative instruments.  If market
rates of interest permanently increased by 63 basis points (a 10% increase from
the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair
value of the Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $5.2
billion.  If market rates of interest
permanently decreased by 63 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s
existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the
Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $6.3 billion.

At December 31, 2005, the Company’s derivative
instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately $6.0 million.  If market rates of interest permanently
increased by 49 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing
weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Company’s
derivative instruments would be approximately $0.1 million.  If market rates of interest permanently
decreased by 49 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing
weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Company’s
derivative instruments would be approximately $11.5 million.

The Company had total outstanding floating rate debt
of approximately $1.4 billion, or 21.5% of total debt at December 31,
2004, net of the effects of any derivative instruments.  If market rates of interest on all of the
floating rate debt permanently increased by 25 basis points (a 10% increase
from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the increase in
interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and
cash flows by approximately $3.5 million. 
If market rates of interest on all of the


floating
rate debt permanently decreased by 25 basis points (a 10% decrease from the
Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in interest
expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows
by approximately $3.5 million.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had total
outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $5.1 billion, net of the effects
of any derivative instruments.  If market
rates of interest permanently increased by 65 basis points (a 10% increase from
the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair
value of the Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $4.6
billion.  If market rates of interest
permanently decreased by 65 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s
existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the
Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $5.6 billion.

At December 31, 2004, the Company’s derivative
instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately $7.9 million.  If market rates of interest permanently
increased by 40 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing
weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Company’s
derivative instruments would be approximately $13.9 million.  If market rates of interest permanently
decreased by 40 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing
weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Company’s
derivative instruments would be approximately $2.2 million.

These amounts were determined by considering the
impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company’s financial
instruments.  The foregoing assumptions
apply to the entire amount of the Company’s debt and derivative instruments and
do not differentiate among maturities. 
These analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall
economic activity that could exist in such an environment.  Further, in the event of changes of such
magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its
exposure to the changes.  However, due to
the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible
effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Company’s financial structure
or results.

The Company cannot predict the effect of adverse
changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and,
therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any assurance that
long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing.  Consequently, future results may differ
materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.

Item
9A.   Controls and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures:

Effective as of December 31,
2005, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15
and 15d-15.  Based on that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in its Exchange Act filings is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms.

(b)

Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

Equity Residential’s
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Exchange Act.  Under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including the Company’s Chief
Executive


Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Based on the Company’s evaluation under the
framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, management concluded that
its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2005.  Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein at Item
8, page F-3.

(c)

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting:

There were no changes to the internal control over
financial reporting of the Company identified in connection with the Company’s
evaluation referred to above that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2005
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Equity Residential (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and
2004 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the accompanying index to the financial statements and schedule. These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Equity Residential at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for variable interest
entities in 2004.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Equity Residential’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28,
2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting at Item 9A, that Equity Residential (the “Company”) maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the “COSO Criteria”). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Equity
Residential maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the COSO Criteria. Also, in our opinion, Equity Residential maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on the COSO Criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance
sheets of Equity Residential as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2005 and our report dated February 28, 2006, except for the fourth
paragraph of Note 21, for which the date is March 2, 2006, expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

1.

Business

Equity Residential (“EQR”),
a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993, is
a fully integrated real estate company primarily engaged in the acquisition,
development, ownership, management and operation of multifamily properties. In
addition, EQR may acquire or develop multifamily properties specifically
to convert directly into condominiums as well as upgrade and sell existing
properties as individual condominiums. EQR may also acquire land parcels
to hold and/or sell based on market opportunities. EQR has elected to be taxed
as a REIT.

EQR is the general
partner of, and as of December 31, 2005 owned an approximate 93.4%
ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited
partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). The Company is structured as an
umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), under which all property ownership and business
operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.
References to the “Company” include EQR, the Operating Partnership and each of
the partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations controlled by
the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.

As of December 31,
2005, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding
entities, owned all or a portion of 926

properties in
31 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 197,404 units (table does
not include various uncompleted development properties). The ownership
breakdown includes:

The “Wholly Owned
Properties” are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting. The
Company beneficially owns 100% fee simple title to 833 of the 834 Wholly Owned
Properties. The Company owns the building and improvements and leases the land
underlying the improvements under a long-term ground lease that expires in 2026
for one property. This one property is consolidated and reflected as a real
estate asset while the ground lease is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

.

The “Partially Owned
Properties” are controlled by the Company but have partners with minority
interests and are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting. The
“Unconsolidated Properties” are partially owned but not controlled by the
Company. With the exception of one property, the Unconsolidated Properties
consist of investments in partnership interests and/or subordinated mortgages
that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The remaining one
property consists of an investment in a limited liability company that, as a
result of the terms of the operating agreement, is accounted for as a
management contract right with all fees recognized as fee and asset management
revenue.

2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

Due to the Company’s
ability as general partner to control either through ownership or by contract
the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, other than entities that own
controlling interests in the Unconsolidated Properties and certain other
entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and
each such subsidiary has been consolidated with the Company for financial
reporting

F-12

purposes. Effective March 31, 2004, the
consolidated financial statements also include all variable interest entities
for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.

The Company’s mergers and
acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in accordance with either
Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 16,

Business Combinations

, or SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

. SFAS No. 141
requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The fair value of the
consideration given by the Company in the mergers were used as the valuation
basis for each of the combinations. The accompanying consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows include the results of the properties purchased
through the mergers and through acquisitions from their respective closing
dates.

Real Estate Assets and
Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate

The Company allocates the
purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets
acquired based on their fair values in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141.
In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price,
the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that
may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the
respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing
comparable properties in our portfolio, and other market data. The Company also
considers information obtained about each property as a result of its
pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating
the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company allocates
the purchase price of acquired real estate to various components as follows:

•

Land – Based
on actual purchase price if acquired separately or market research/comparables
if acquired with an operating property.

•

Furniture,
Fixtures and Equipment – Ranges between $1,500 and $3,000 per apartment unit
acquired as an estimate of the fair value of the appliances & fixtures
inside a unit. The per-unit amount applied depends on the type of apartment
building acquired. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over
an estimated useful life of five years.

•

In-Place
Leases – The Company considers the value of acquired in-place leases that meet
the definition outlined in SFAS No. 141, paragraph 37. The amortization
period is the average remaining term of each respective in-place acquired
lease.

•

Other
Intangible Assets – The Company considers whether it has acquired other
intangible assets that meet the definition outlined in SFAS No. 141,
paragraph 39, including any customer relationship intangibles. The amortization
period is the estimated useful life of the acquired intangible asset.

•

Building –
Based on the fair value determined on an “as-if vacant” basis. Depreciation is
calculated on the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of thirty
years.

Replacements inside a
unit such as appliances and carpeting are depreciated over a five-year
estimated useful life. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are
expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements
that improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over
their estimated useful life, generally five to ten years. Initial direct
leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense approximates the
deferral and amortization of initial direct leasing costs over the lease terms.
Property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers to unrelated
third parties, contingencies have been removed and sufficient cash consideration
has been received by the Company. Upon disposition, the related costs and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts. Any gain or
loss on sale is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

The Company classifies
real estate assets as real estate held for disposition when it is certain a
property will be disposed of in accordance with SFAS No. 144 (see further
discussion below).

The Company classifies
properties under development and/or expansion and properties in the lease up
phase (including land) as construction in progress until construction has been
completed and all

F-13

certificates of occupancy permits have been obtained.

Impairment

of Long-Lived
Assets, Including Goodwill

In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. SFAS No. 142
prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires that goodwill be reviewed
for impairment at least annually. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.

SFAS Nos. 142 and 144 were effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company adopted these
standards effective January 1, 2002. See Notes 13 and 19 for further
discussion.

The
Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments
in real estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent impairment. The
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors
such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of
each asset and legal and environmental concerns. Future events could occur
which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and
an impairment loss is warranted.

For long-lived assets to
be held and used, the Company compares the expected future undiscounted cash
flows for the long-lived asset against the carrying amount of that asset. If
the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying
amount of the asset, the Company further analyzes each individual asset for
other temporary or permanent indicators of impairment. An impairment loss would
be recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the
carrying amount of the asset if the Company deems this difference to be
permanent.

For long-lived assets to
be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value
of the asset, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount
of the asset measured at the time that the Company has determined it will sell
the asset. Long-lived assets held for disposition and the related liabilities
are separately reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated
fair values, less their costs to sell, and are not depreciated after
reclassification to real estate held for disposition.

Cost

Capitalization

See
the

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of
Investment in Real Estate

section for discussion of the policy
with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and
maintenance costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and
associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of
their time on the supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects. These
costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable
property.

The
Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67,

Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate
Projects

, for all development projects and uses its professional
judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization
or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes

interest, real estate taxes and insurance and
payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and
who spend all of their time on development activities, with
capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the
certificate of occupancy. These costs
are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each
specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of
on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on
our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on
specific major renovation at selected properties when additional incremental
employees are hired.

F-14

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all
demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of
deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or
less, at the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains
its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions. The combined account
balances at one or more institutions typically exceed the Federal Depository
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a
concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC
insurance coverage. The Company believes that the risk is not significant, as
the Company does not anticipate the financial institutions’ non-performance.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs
include fees and costs incurred to obtain the Company’s lines of credit and
long-term financings. These costs are amortized over the terms of the related
debt. Unamortized financing costs are written-off when debt is retired before
the maturity date. The accumulated amortization of such deferred financing
costs was $18.3 million and $18.1 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Fair

Value

of Financial
Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments

The
valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107,

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

,
and SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149),

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

, requires the Company to make estimates and judgments
that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible,
bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative
instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are
not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with
similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial
instruments.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest
rate changes. The Company limits these risks by following established risk
management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge
interest rate risk on debt instruments.

The
Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial
institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in
conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives
are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those
instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net
income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

On
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 and its amendments
(SFAS Nos. 137/138/149), which requires an entity to recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to
measure those instruments at fair value. Additionally, the fair value
adjustments will affect either shareholders’ equity or net income depending on
whether the derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes
and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. When the terms of an underlying
transaction are modified, or when the underlying transaction is terminated or
completed, all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked-to-market
with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument
matures. Any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet
the hedging criteria of SFAS No. 133 is marked-to-market each period. The
Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The
fair value of the Company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were both
approximately $3.6 billion at December 31, 2005.

The fair values of
the Company’s financial instruments, other than mortgage notes payable,
unsecured notes and derivative instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, lines of credit and other financial instruments, approximate their
carrying or contract values. See Note 11 for further discussion of derivative
instruments.

F-15

Revenue Recognition

Rental income
attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized
monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a
straight-line basis. Leases entered into between a resident and a property, for
the rental of an apartment unit, are generally year-to-year, renewable upon
consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. Fee and asset management
revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis.

Stock-Based Compensation

The
Company elected to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with
SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148),

Accounting for Stock Based Compensation

,
effective in the first quarter of 2003, which resulted in compensation expense
being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted.

The
Company elected the “Prospective Method” which requires expensing of employee
awards granted or modified after January 1, 2003. Compensation expense
under all of the Company’s plans is generally recognized over periods ranging
from three months to five years.

The
Company will adopt SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment,

as
required effective January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123(R) will require all
companies to expense stock-based compensation (such as stock options), as well
as making other revisions to SFAS No. 123. As the Company began expensing
all stock-based compensation effective January 1, 2003, the adoption of
SFAS No. 123(R) will not have a material effect on its consolidated
statements of operations or financial position.

The
cost related to stock-based employee compensation included in the determination
of net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 is equal to that which
would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to
all awards since the original effective date of SFAS No. 123. The cost
related to stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of
net income for the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2003 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based
method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS
No. 123. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and
earnings per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all
outstanding and unvested awards for the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003 (amounts in thousands except per share amounts):

F-16

(1)

Share
options for the year ended December 31, 2003 included $1.4 million of
expense recognition related to options granted in the first quarter of 2003 to
the Company’s former chief executive officer. These options vested immediately
upon grant.

The fair value of the
option grants as computed under SFAS No. 123 would be recognized over the
vesting period of the options. The fair value for the Company’s share options
was estimated at the time the share options were granted using the Black
Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The valuation method and
assumptions are the same as those the Company used in accounting for option
expense in its consolidated financial statements. The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. This
model is only one method of valuing options and the Company’s use of this model
should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy. Because the
Company’s share options have characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the
existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the
fair value of its share options and the actual value of the options may be
significantly different.

F-17

Income Taxes

Due to the structure of
the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations of its operating
properties, no provision for federal income taxes has been made at the EQR
level. Historically, the Company has generally only incurred certain state and
local income, excise and franchise taxes. The Company has elected Taxable REIT
Subsidiary (“TRS”) status for certain of its corporate subsidiaries, primarily
those entities engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities.

The Company provided for current
income, franchise and excise taxes allocated as follows in the consolidated
statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003 (amounts in thousands):

(1)

Primarily includes state
and local income, excise and franchise taxes. In 2005, also includes $2.0
million of federal income taxes related to the sale of land parcels owned by a
TRS and included in income from continuing operations.

(2)

Primarily represents
federal income taxes incurred on the gains on sales of condominium units owned
by a TRS.

(3)

Primarily represents
state and local income, excise and franchise taxes on operating properties sold
and included in discontinued operations.

The Company utilized
approximately $43.9 million of net operating losses (“NOL”) during the year
ended December 31, 2005 and has no NOL carryforwards available as of January 1,
2006.

During the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company’s tax treatment of dividends and distributions
were as follows:

The aggregate cost of
land and depreciable property for federal income tax purposes as of December 31,
2005 and 2004 was approximately $9.4 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively.

F-18

Minority Interests

Operating Partnership: Net
income is allocated to minority interests based on their respective ownership
percentage of the Operating Partnership. The ownership percentage is calculated
by dividing the number of units of limited partnership interest (“OP Units”)
held by the minority interests by the total OP Units held by the minority interests
and EQR. Issuance of additional common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par
value per share (the “Common Shares”), and OP Units changes the ownership
interests of both the minority interests and EQR. Such transactions and the
proceeds therefrom are treated as capital transactions.

Partially Owned
Properties: The Company reflects minority interests in partially owned
properties on the balance sheet for the portion of properties consolidated by
the Company that are not wholly owned by the Company. The earnings or losses
from those properties attributable to the minority interests are reflected as
minority interests in partially owned properties in the consolidated statements
of operations.

U

se of Estimates

In preparation of the
Company’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been made to the prior period
financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation.
These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations or
shareholders’ equity.

Other

The
Company adopted FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46,

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities,

as required, effective March 31,
2004. The adoption required the consolidation of all previously unconsolidated
development projects. FIN No. 46 requires the Company to consolidate the
assets, liabilities and results of operations of the activities of a variable
interest entity, which for the Company includes only its development
partnerships, if the Company is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s
residual returns and/or is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from such
entity’s activities. Due to the March 31, 2004 effective date, the Company
has only consolidated the results of operations beginning April 1, 2004. The
adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have any effect on net income as the aggregate
results of operations of these development properties were previously included
in income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities.

The Company adopted the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 150 and FSP No. FAS 150-3,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of
both Liabilities and Equity,

effective December 31, 2003. SFAS No. 150
and FSP No. FAS 150-3 require the Company to make certain disclosures
regarding noncontrolling interests that are classified as equity in the
financial statements of a subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in
the parent’s financial statements under SFAS No. 150 (e.g., minority
interests in consolidated limited-life subsidiaries). The Company is presently
the controlling partner in various consolidated partnerships consisting of 35
properties and 6,004 units and various uncompleted development properties
having a minority interest book value of $17.0 million at December 31,
2005. Some of these partnerships contain provisions that require the
partnerships to be liquidated through the sale of its assets upon reaching a
date specified in each respective partnership agreement. The Company, as
controlling partner, has an obligation to cause the property owning
partnerships to distribute proceeds of liquidation to the Minority Interests in
these Partially Owned Properties only to the extent that the net proceeds
received by the partnerships from the

F-19

sale of its assets warrant a distribution based on the
partnership agreements. As of December 31, 2005, the Company estimates the
value of Minority Interest distributions would have been approximately $73.4
million (“Settlement Value”) had the partnerships been liquidated. This
Settlement Value is based on estimated third party consideration realized by
the partnerships upon disposition of the Partially Owned Properties and is net
of all other assets and liabilities, including yield maintenance on the
mortgages encumbering the properties, that would have been due on December 31,
2005 had those mortgages been prepaid. Due to, among other things, the inherent
uncertainty in the sale of real estate assets, the amount of any potential
distribution to the Minority Interests in the Company’s Partially Owned
Properties is subject to change. To the extent that the partnerships’
underlying assets are worth less than the underlying liabilities, the Company
has no obligation to remit any consideration to the Minority Interests in
Partially Owned Properties.

In June 2005, the
FASB ratified the consensus in EITF Issue No. 04-5,

Determining
Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a
Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain
Rights

(“Issue 04-5”), which provides guidance in determining
whether a general partner controls a limited partnership. Issue 04-5 states
that the general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that
limited partnership. The presumption may be overcome if the limited
partners have either (1) the substantive ability to dissolve the limited
partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without cause or (2) substantive
participating rights, which provide the limited partners with the ability to
effectively participate in significant decisions that would be expected to be
made in the ordinary course of the limited partnership’s business and thereby
preclude the general partner from exercising unilateral control over the
partnership. The adoption of Issue 04-5 by the Company is required for new or
modified limited partnership arrangements effective June 30, 2005 and
existing limited partnership arrangements effective January 1, 2006. Effective
January 1, 2006, the Company will consolidate its Lexford syndicated
portfolio consisting of 20 separate partnerships (10 properties) containing
1,272 units representing approximately $20.0 million of both net investment in
real estate and mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2005. The adoption
is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations or
financial position nor is it expected to have any effect on net equity or net
income as the aggregate results of the aforementioned Lexford syndicated
portfolio is already included in investments in unconsolidated entities and
income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities, respectively.

In March 2005, the
FASB issued FIN No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations,

an interpretation of SFAS No. 143,

Asset Retirement Obligations

. A
conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to retire
assets where the timing and/or method of settlement are conditioned on future
events. FIN No. 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the
fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the
liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the
provisions of FIN No. 47 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The
adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Shareholders’ Equity and Minority Interests

The following tables present the changes in the Company’s
issued and outstanding Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003:

F-20

In February 1998,
the Company filed and the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 Registration
Statement to register $1.0 billion of equity securities. In addition, the
Company carried over $272.4 million related to a prior registration statement. As
of February 1, 2006, $956.5 million in equity securities remained
available for issuance under this registration statement.

The equity positions of various
individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating
Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the “Minority
Interests – Operating Partnership”. Subject to certain restrictions, the
Minority Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for
EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

Net proceeds from the Company’s Common
Share and Preferred Share (see definition below) offerings are contributed by
the Company to the Operating Partnership. In return for those contributions,
EQR receives a number of OP Units in the Operating Partnership equal to the
number of Common Shares it has issued in the equity offering (or in the case of
a preferred equity offering, a number of preference units in the Operating
Partnership equal in number and having the same terms as the Preferred Shares
issued in the equity offering). As a result, the net offering proceeds from
Common Shares and Preferred Shares are allocated between shareholders’ equity
and Minority Interests – Operating Partnership to account for the change in
their respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating
Partnership.

The Company’s declaration of trust
authorizes the Company to issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares of
beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the “Preferred Shares”), with
specific rights,

F-21

preferences and other attributes as the Board of Trustees may determine,
which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the rights
of holders of the Company’s Common Shares.

The following table
presents the Company’s issued and outstanding Preferred Shares as of December 31,
2005 and 2004:

(1)

On or after the
redemption date, redeemable preferred shares (Series C, D, K and N) may be
redeemed for cash at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at a
redemption price equal to the liquidation price per share, plus accrued and
unpaid distributions, if any.

On or after the
redemption date, convertible preferred shares (Series E & H) may be
redeemed under certain circumstances at the option of the Company for cash (in
the case of Series E) or Common Shares (in the case of Series H), in

contractual conversion rate, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any.

(3)

Dividends on all series of
Preferred Shares are payable quarterly at various pay dates. Dividend rates
listed for Series C, D and N are Preferred Share rates and the equivalent
Depositary Share annual dividend rates are $2.28125, $2.15 and $1.62, respectively.

issued by Merry Land & Investment Company, Inc. prior to its
merger with the Company.

On June 19, 2003,
the Company issued 600,000 Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares
in a public offering. The Company received $145.3 million in net proceeds from
this offering after payment of the underwriters’ fee.

On December 26,
2003, the Company redeemed the remaining outstanding Series G Convertible
Cumulative Preferred Shares for cash consideration of $295.3 million, which
included the liquidation value of $287.0 million and a cash redemption premium
of $8.3 million. The Company recorded the $8.3 million cash redemption premium
along with the write-off of $11.9 million in original issuance costs as a
premium on redemption of Preferred Shares in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.

The following table
presents the issued and outstanding Preference Interests as of December 31,
2005 and December 31, 2004:

(1)

On or after the fifth anniversary of the respective issuance (the “Redemption

holder (in whole but not in part) to Common Shares based upon the contractual
conversion rate, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any. Prior to the
Conversion Date, the convertible Preference Interests (Series H, I, &
J) may be converted at the option of the holder (in whole but not in part)
to Common Shares based upon the contractual conversion rate, plus accrued and

Lines
of Credit

On April 1, 2005,
the Operating Partnership obtained a new three-year $1.0 billion unsecured
revolving credit facility maturing on May 29, 2008, and terminated the
$700.0 million credit facility that was scheduled to expire in May 2005.  The Operating Partnership has the ability to
increase available borrowings up to $500.0 million under certain
circumstances.  Advances under the new
facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest
periods plus a spread dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s credit rating
or based on bids received from the lending group.  EQR has guaranteed the Operating Partnership’s
credit facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.

On August 30, 2005,
the Operating Partnership obtained a new one-year $600.0 million revolving
credit facility maturing on August 29, 2006.  Advances under the new facility bore interest
at variable rates based on LIBOR at various interest periods plus a spread
dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s credit rating.  EQR guaranteed this credit facility up to the
maximum amount and for its full term. 
This credit facility was repaid in full and terminated on January 20,
2006.

As of December 31,
2005 and 2004, $769.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, was outstanding
and $50.2 million and $65.4 million, respectively, was restricted (dedicated to
support letters of credit and not available for borrowing) on the credit
facilities.  During the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, the weighted average interest rate was 3.80% and 1.73%,
respectively.

11.

Derivative Instruments

The following table
summarizes the consolidated derivative instruments at December 31, 2005
(dollar amounts are in thousands):

F-30

(1) Fair Value Hedges – Converts outstanding
fixed rate debt to a floating interest rate.

(2) Forward Starting Swaps – Designed to
partially fix the interest rate in advance of a planned future debt issuance.

(3) Development Cash Flow Hedges – Converts
outstanding floating rate debt to a fixed interest rate.

On December 31,
2005, the net derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as other
assets of approximately $9.7 million and as other liabilities of approximately
$15.7 million.  As of December 31,
2005, there were approximately $14.8 million in deferred losses, net, included
in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
Based on the estimated fair values of the net derivative instruments at December 31,
2005, the Company may recognize an estimated $3.1 million of accumulated other
comprehensive loss as additional interest expense during the twelve months
ending December 31, 2006.

During the year ended December 31,
2005, the Company paid approximately $7.8 million to terminate eight forward
starting swaps in conjunction with the issuance of $500.0 million of ten and
one-half year unsecured notes.  The $7.8
million has been deferred and will be recognized as additional interest expense
over the life of the unsecured notes.

In January 2006, the
Company received approximately $10.7 million to terminate six forward starting
swaps in conjunction with the issuance of $400.0 million of ten and one-half
year unsecured notes.  The $10.7 million
has been deferred and will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense
over the life of the unsecured notes.

Earnings Per Share

The following tables set
forth the computation of net income per share – basic and net income per share
– diluted:

F-31

F-32

Convertible preferred shares/units
that could be converted into 1,772,048, 3,215,472 and 14,745,904 weighted
average Common Shares for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive.

For additional disclosures regarding
the employee share options and restricted shares, see Notes 2 and 14.

13.

Discontinued Operations

The Company has presented
separately as discontinued operations in all periods the results of operations
for all consolidated assets disposed of on or after January 1, 2002 (the
date of adoption of SFAS No. 144) and all operations related to
condominium conversion properties effective upon their respective transfer into
a TRS.

The
components of discontinued operations are outlined below and include the
results of operations for the respective periods that the Company owned such
assets during each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003.

F-33

(1)

Includes
expenses paid in the current period for properties sold in prior periods
related to the Company’s period of ownership.

(2)

Interest
only includes interest expense specific to secured mortgage notes payable for
properties sold.

For the properties sold
during 2005 (excluding condominium conversion properties), the investment in
real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, and the mortgage notes payable
balances at December 31, 2004 were $805.2 million and $111.8 million,
respectively.

The net real estate basis
of the Company’s condominium conversion properties and land parcels owned by
the TRS, which were included in investment in real estate, net in the
consolidated balance sheets, was $276.8 million and $335.5 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

14.

Share
Incentive Plans

On
May 15, 2002, the shareholders of EQR approved the Company’s 2002 Share Incentive
Plan.  The maximum aggregate number of
awards that may be granted under this plan may not exceed 7.5% of the Company’s
outstanding Common Shares calculated on a “fully diluted” basis and determined
annually on the first day of each calendar year.  As of January 1, 2006, this amount
equaled 23,370,851, of which 15,421,477 is available for future issuance.  No awards may be granted under the 2002 Share
Incentive Plan after February 20, 2012.

Pursuant to the 2002
Share Incentive Plan and the Fifth Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and
Share Award Plan (collectively the “Share Incentive Plans”), officers,
trustees, key employees and consultants of the Company may be offered the
opportunity to acquire Common Shares through the grant of share options (“Options”)
including non-qualified share options (“NQSOs”), incentive share options (“ISOs”)
and share appreciation rights (“SARs”), or may be granted restricted or
non-restricted shares.  Additionally,
officers and key employees of the Company may be awarded Common Shares, subject
to conditions and restrictions as described in the Share Incentive Plans.  Finally, certain executive officers of

F-34

the Company are subject to the Company’s performance
based restricted share plan.  Options,
SARs, restricted shares and performance shares are sometimes collectively
referred to herein as “Awards”.

The Options generally are
granted at the fair market value of the Company’s Common Shares at the date of
grant, vest over a three year period, are exercisable upon vesting and expire
ten years from the date of grant.  The
exercise price for all Options under the Share Incentive Plans shall not be
less than the fair market value of the underlying Common Shares at the time the
Option is granted.  The Fifth Amended and
Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan will terminate at such time as
all outstanding Awards have expired or have been exercised/vested.  The Board of Trustees may at any time amend
or terminate the Share Incentive Plans, but termination will not affect Awards
previously granted.  Any Options which
had vested prior to such a termination would remain exercisable by the holder
thereof.

As to the Options that
have been granted through December 31, 2005, generally, one-third are
exercisable one year after the initial grant, one-third are exercisable two
years following the date such Options were granted and the remaining one-third
are exercisable three years following the date such Options were granted.

As to the restricted shares that
have been awarded through December 31, 2005, these shares generally vest
three years from the award date.  During
the three-year period of restriction, the employee receives quarterly dividend
payments on their shares.  The Company’s
unvested restricted shareholders receive dividends at the same rate and on the
same date as any other Common Share holder. 
In addition, the Company’s unvested restricted shareholders have the
same voting rights as any other Common Share holder.  As a result, dividends paid on unvested
restricted shares are included as a distribution in excess of accumulated
earnings and have not been considered in reducing net income available to
Common Shares in a manner similar to the Company’s preferred share dividends
for the earnings per share calculation. 
If employment is terminated prior to the lapsing of the restriction, the
shares are canceled.

In addition, each year selected
executive officers of the Company receive performance-based awards.  The executive officers have the opportunity
to earn in Common Shares an amount as little as 0% to as much as 225% of the
target number of performance-based awards. 
The owners of performance-based awards have no right to vote, receive
dividends or transfer the awards until Common Shares are issued in exchange for
the awards.  The number of Common Shares
the executive officer actually receives on the third anniversary of the grant
date will depend on the excess, if any, by which the Company’s Average Annual
Return (i.e., the average of the Common Share dividends declared during each
year as a percentage of the Common Share price as of the first business day of
the first performance year and the average percentage increase in funds from
operations (“FFO”) for each calendar year on a per share basis over the prior
year) for the three performance years exceeds the average of the 10-year
Treasury Note interest rate as of the first business day in January of
each performance year (the “T-Note Rate”).

If the Company’s Average Annual
Return exceeds the T-Note Rate by an amount which falls between any of the
percentages in excess of the 2% threshold, the performance-based award will be
determined by extrapolation between the two percentages.  Fifty percent of the Common Shares to which
an executive officer may be entitled under the performance share grants will
vest, subject to the

F-35

executive’s
continued employment with the Company, on the third anniversary of the award
(which will be the date the Common Shares are issued); twenty-five percent will
vest on the fourth anniversary and the remaining twenty-five percent will vest
on the fifth anniversary.  The Common
Shares will also fully vest upon the executive’s death, retirement at or after
age 62, disability or upon a change in control of the Company.

The following table summarizes
information regarding both the restricted and performance-based share plans for
the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003:

(1)   2005 amount includes $8.9 million of
additional one-time expenses related to restricted/performance shares for Bruce
W.Duncan and Edward Geraghty. See Note 21 for further discussion.

For
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded
compensation expense of $6.8 million, $3.0 million and $2.6 million,
respectively, related to Options.

The
Company elected to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with
SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148),

Accounting for Stock Based Compensation

,
effective in the first quarter of 2003, which resulted in compensation expense
being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted.

Compensation expense
related to restricted and performance-based share grants was previously
recognized in accordance with APB No. 25. 
The adoption of SFAS No. 123 does not significantly change the
amount of compensation expense recognized for these grants.

See Note 2 for additional
information regarding the Company’s stock-based compensation.

The table below
summarizes the Option activity of the Share Incentive Plans and options assumed
in connection with mergers (the “Merger Options”) for the three years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003:

The following table summarizes information regarding
options outstanding at December 31, 2005:

As of December 31,
2004 and 2003, 6,851,442 Options (with a weighted average exercise price of $24.47)
and 8,274,915 Options (with a weighted average exercise price of $23.86) were
exercisable,

F-37

respectively.

15.

Employee
Plans

The Company established
an Employee Share Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) to provide employees and trustees
the ability to annually acquire up to $100,000 of Common Shares of the
Company.  In 2003, the Company’s
shareholders approved an increase in the aggregate number of Common Shares
available under the ESPP to 7,000,000 (from 2,000,000).  The Company has 4,484,186 Common Shares
available for purchase under the ESPP at December 31, 2005.  The Common Shares may be purchased quarterly
at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a share
on the last day of such quarter; and (b) the greater of: (i) the
closing price for a share on the first day of such quarter, and (ii) the
average closing price for a share for all the business days in the
quarter.  The following table summarizes
information regarding the Common Shares issued under the ESPP:

The Company established a
defined contribution plan (the “401(k) Plan”) to provide retirement benefits
for employees that meet minimum employment criteria.  The Company matches dollar for dollar up to
the first 3% of eligible compensation that a participant contributes to the
401(k) Plan (2% for 2004 and 2003). 
Participants are vested in the Company’s contributions over five
years.  The Company made contributions in
the amount of $1.7 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, and expects to make contributions in the amount of
approximately $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The
Company may also elect to make an annual discretionary profit-sharing
contribution as a percentage of each individual employee’s eligible
compensation under the 401(k) Plan.  The
Company expects to make contributions in the amount of approximately $2.6
million for the year ended December 31, 2005.  The Company did not make a contribution for the
years ended December 31, 2004 or 2003.

The
Company established a supplemental executive retirement savings plan (the “SERP”)
to provide certain officers and trustees an opportunity to defer a portion of
their eligible compensation in order to save for retirement.  The SERP is restricted to investments in
Company Common Shares, certain marketable securities that have been
specifically approved, and cash equivalents. 
The deferred compensation liability represented in the SERP and the
securities issued to fund such deferred compensation liability are consolidated
by the Company and carried on the Company’s balance sheet, and the Company’s
Common Shares held in the SERP are accounted for as a reduction to paid in
capital.

16.

Distribution
Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan

On November 3, 1997,
the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3 Registration Statement to
register 14,000,000 Common Shares pursuant to a Distribution Reinvestment and
Share Purchase Plan (the “DRIP Plan”). 
The registration statement was declared effective on November 25,
1997.  The Company has 11,571,446 Common
Shares available for issuance under the DRIP Plan at December 31, 2005.

The DRIP Plan provides
holders of record and beneficial owners of Common Shares and Preferred Shares
with a simple and convenient method of investing cash distributions in
additional Common Shares (which is referred to herein as the “Dividend
Reinvestment – DRIP Plan”).  Common
Shares may also be purchased on a monthly basis with optional cash payments
made by participants in the DRIP Plan and

F-38

interested new investors, not currently shareholders
of the Company, at the market price of the Common Shares less a discount
ranging between 0% and 5%, as determined in accordance with the DRIP Plan
(which is referred to herein as the “Share Purchase – DRIP Plan”).  Common Shares purchased under the DRIP Plan
may, at the option of the Company, be directly issued by the Company or
purchased by the Company’s transfer agent in the open market using participants’
funds.

17.

Transactions
with Related Parties

The Company provided
asset and property management services to certain related entities for
properties not owned by the Company. 
Fees received for providing such services were approximately $0.2
million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company reimbursed its Chief
Operating Officer for the actual operating costs (excluding acquisition costs)
of operating his personal aircraft for himself and other employees on Company
business.  Amounts incurred were approximately
$0.4 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company leases its
corporate headquarters from an entity controlled by EQR’s Chairman of the Board
of Trustees.  Amounts incurred for such
office space for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, were approximately $2.1 million, $1.9 million and $1.7
million.  The Company believes these
amounts equal market rates for such space.

The Company had the
following additional non-continuing related party transaction.  The Company leased space in an office
building in Augusta, Georgia indirectly owned by one of EQR’s former trustees
since May 2003 and directly owned by an entity affiliated with the same
EQR trustee from 1998 to 2003 (individual was a trustee through May 2004).
 Amounts incurred for such office space
were approximately $0.2 million for both the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003.

18.

Commitments
and Contingencies

The Company, as an owner
of real estate, is subject to various Federal, state and local environmental
laws.  Compliance by the Company with
existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on the Company.  However, the Company cannot predict the
impact of new or changed laws or regulations on its current properties or on
properties that it may acquire in the future.

T

he Company tried a class action lawsuit in
Palm Beach County, Florida during the last week of August of 2004 which
challenged the assessment and collection of certain lease termination fees.  The case has been settled, subject to court
approval.  The Company will pay $1.7
million into a class fund, $1.629 million of which was previously accrued
during 2004.  In addition, the Company
will pay $325,000 to reimburse class counsel for its out of pocket expenses,
plus $2.55 million in attorney’s fees. 
Costs of claims administration will be approximately $100,000.  An accrual for these additional potential payments
was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005. 
Preliminary court approval of the settlement was obtained in February 2006
and final judgment is expected in the second quarter of 2006.

The
Company does not believe there is any other litigation pending or threatened
against the Company which, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably may be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

During the year ended December 31,
2004, the Company established a reserve and recorded a corresponding expense of
$15.2 million in estimated uninsured property damage at certain of its
properties primarily located in Florida caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances,
Ivan and Jeanne (included in rents received in advance and other liabilities
and real estate taxes and insurance expense on the consolidated balance sheets
and statements of operations, respectively). 
The entire reserve had been spent for hurricane

F-39

related repairs through December 31, 2005.

During the year ended December 31,
2005, the Company established a reserve and recorded a corresponding expense of
$11.1 million, net of $8.1 million of insurance receivables, for estimated
uninsured property damage at certain of its properties caused by Hurricane
Wilma.  The receivable of $8.1 million
and the reserve of $19.2 million are included in other assets and rents
received in advance and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated
balance sheets.  The expense of $11.1
million is included in real estate taxes and insurance expense in the
consolidated statements of operations.

As of December 31, 2005, the
Company has six projects

totaling 1,760 units

in various
stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through March 31,
2008. The primary development agreements currently in place have the following
key terms:

•

The first development partner has
the right, at any time following completion of a project subject to the
agreement, to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest
in the project to the Company based on such value.  If the Company chooses not to purchase the interest,
the Company must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at
such value.  The Company’s partner must
exercise this right as to all projects subject to the agreement within five
years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last
developed property.  In connection with
this development agreement, the Company has
an obligation to provide up to $40.0 million in credit enhancements to
guarantee a portion of the third party construction financing.  As of February 1, 2006, the Company did
not have any amounts outstanding related to this credit enhancement.  The Company would be required to perform
under this agreement only if there was a material default under a third party
construction mortgage agreement.  This
agreement expires no later than December 31, 2018.  Notwithstanding the termination of the
agreement, the Company shall have recourse against its development partner for
any losses incurred.

•

The second
development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a
project subject to the agreement, to require the Company to purchase the
partners’ interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price.  If the Company and the partner are unable to
agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals.  If the appraised values vary by more than
10%, both the Company and its partner will agree on a third appraiser to
determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of
value.  The Company may elect at that
time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize its partner to sell
the project at or above the agreed-upon value to an unrelated third party.

Five years
following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last
developed property, the Company must purchase, at the agreed-upon price, any
projects remaining unsold.

•

The
third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following
stabilization, as defined, to market a subject project for sale.  Thereafter, either the Company or its
development partner may market a subject project for sale.  If the Company’s development partner proposes
the sale, the Company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed
by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the
project.  If the two appraised values
vary by more than 5%, a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair
market value of the property.  Once a
value has been determined, the Company may elect to purchase the property or
authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreed-upon value.

In addition, the Company has various
deal-specific development agreements with partners, the overall terms of which
are similar in nature to those described above.

The Company’s guaranty of a credit enhancement agreement with respect to
certain tax-exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a
multifamily development project was terminated effective May 2, 2005 as
the tax-exempt bonds were redeemed in full and the associated letter of credit
was cancelled.

F-40

During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, total
operating lease payments incurred for office space, including a portion of real
estate taxes, insurance, repairs and utilities, aggregated $6.1 million, $5.8
million and $5.7 million, respectively.

The Company has entered
into a retirement benefits agreement with its Chairman of the Board of Trustees
and deferred compensation agreements with its chief operating officer and two
former chief executive officers.  During
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized
compensation expense of $2.2 million, $39,000 and $3.0 million, respectively,
related to these agreements.

The following table
summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations for minimum rent payments
under operating leases and deferred compensation for the next five years and thereafter
as of December 31, 2005:

(a)

Minimum
basic rent due for various office space the Company leases and fixed base rent
due on a ground lease for one property.

(b)

Estimated
payments to the Company’s Chairman, two former CEO’s and its chief operating
officer based on planned retirement

dates.

19.

Asset Impairment

The Company recorded
approximately $1.2 million of asset impairment charges related to its
technology investments in the year ending December 31, 2003. These charges
were the result of a review of the existing investments reflected on the
consolidated balance sheet.  These
impairment losses are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations in
total expenses and include the write-down of assets classified as other assets.

20.

Reportable
Segments

Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by senior
management.  Senior management decides
how resources are allocated and assesses performance on a monthly basis.

The
Company’s primary business is owning, managing, and operating multifamily
residential properties, which includes the generation of rental and other
related income through the leasing of apartment units to residents and includes
Equity Corporate Housing (“ECH”).  Senior
management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment communities on an
individual basis; however, each of our apartment communities has similar
economic characteristics, residents, and products and services so they have
been aggregated into one reportable segment. 
The Company’s rental real estate segment comprises approximately 99.4%,
99.3% and 99.1% of total revenues from continuing operations for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The Company’s rental real estate segment
comprises approximately 99.8% of total assets at both December 31, 2005
and 2004.

The
primary financial measure for the Company’s rental real estate segment is net
operating income (“NOI”), which represents rental income less: 1) property and
maintenance expense; 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense; and 3)
property management expense (all as reflected in the accompanying statements of
operations).  The Company believes that
NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating
performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the
actual operating results of the Company’s apartment communities.  Current year NOI is compared to prior year
NOI and current year budgeted NOI as a measure of financial performance.  The following table presents

F-41

the NOI from our rental real
estate specific to continuing operations for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively:

The
Company’s fee and asset management activity is immaterial and does not meet the
threshold requirements of a reportable segment as provided for in SFAS No. 131.

All
revenues are from external customers and there is no customer who contributed
10% or more of the Company’s total revenues during the three years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 or 2003.

21.

Subsequent
Events/Other

Subsequent to December 31,
2005 and through February 1, 2006, the Company:

•

Acquired $148.7
million of apartment properties consisting of three properties and 705 units;

•

Sold $230.2
million of apartment properties consisting of six properties and 1,681 units (excluding
condominium units);

•

Issued $400.0
million of ten and one-half year 5.375% fixed rate public notes, receiving net
proceeds of $395.5 million and terminated six forward starting swaps designated
to hedge the note issuance, receiving net proceeds of $10.7 million;

•

Terminated its
$600.0 million short-term revolving credit facility; and

•

Repaid $13.0
million of mortgage loans.

During February 2006,
the Company repurchased 719,800 of its Common Shares on the open market at an
average price of $43.76 per share.  The
Company paid approximately $31.5 million for these shares.  These Common Shares were repurchased to offset
the issuance of 661,962 OP Units in connection with a property acquisition and
to partially offset restricted shares granted in February 2006.

See also Note 3 for
discussion of the redemption notices on the Series G and H Preference
Interests.

On March 2, 2006, the
Company announced that it has retained JP Morgan to assist in the possible sale
of its Lexford housing division.  As of
March 2, 2006, the division is comprised of 299 properties consisting of 27,390
apartment units located in ten states and a property management business
located in Columbus, Ohio.  Exploration
of a sale does not mandate that a sale or other transaction will follow.  The Company's Board of Trustees has not
approved any specific transaction.

During the year ended December 31,
2005, the Company received proceeds from technology and other investments of
$82.1 million from the following:

•

$25.0 million in
full redemption of 1,000,000 shares of Wellsford 8.25% Convertible Trust
Preferred Securities; and

•

$57.1 million for
its ownership interest in Rent.com in connection with the acquisition of Rent.com
by eBay, Inc.  The $57.1 million was
