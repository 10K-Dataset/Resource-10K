PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Equity Residential (“EQR”), a Maryland real estate
    investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993, is an
    S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition,
    development and management of high quality apartment properties
    in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be taxed
    as a REIT.

The Company is one of the largest publicly traded real estate
    companies and is the largest publicly traded owner of
    multifamily properties in the United States (based on the
    aggregate market value of its outstanding Common Shares, the
    number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues
    earned). The Company’s corporate headquarters are located
    in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also operates property
    management offices in each of its markets.

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2010
    owned an approximate 95.5% ownership interest in, ERP Operating
    Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the
    “Operating Partnership”). All of EQR’s property
    ownership, development and related business operations are
    conducted through the Operating Partnership and its
    subsidiaries. References to the “Company” include EQR,
    the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled
    by the Operating Partnership

and/or

EQR.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company, directly or
    indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned
    all or a portion of 451 properties located in 17 states and
    the District of Columbia consisting of 129,604 apartment units.
    The ownership breakdown includes (table does not include various
    uncompleted development properties):

129,604

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately
    4,000 employees who provided real estate operations,
    leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition,
    development and other support functions.

Business
    Objectives and Operating and Investing Strategies

The Company invests in apartment communities located in
    strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our
    risk adjusted total return (operating income plus capital
    appreciation) on invested capital.

Our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates
    to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to
    generate the highest possible return to our shareholders.
    Revenue is maximized by driving qualified resident prospects to
    our properties, converting this traffic cost-effectively into
    new leases at the highest rent possible, keeping our residents
    satisfied and renewing their leases at yet higher rents. While
    we believe that it is our high-quality, well-located assets that
    bring our customers to us, it is our customer service that keeps
    them renting with us and recommending us to their friends.

We use technology to engage our customers in the way that they
    want to be engaged. Many of our residents utilize our web-based
    resident portal which allows them to review their account and
    make payments, provide feedback and make service requests
    on-line.



We seek to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by
    investing in markets that are characterized by conditions
    favorable to multifamily property appreciation. These markets
    generally feature one or more of the following:

n

High barriers to entry where,
    because of land scarcity or government regulation, it is
    difficult or costly to build new apartment properties leading to
    low supply;

n

High single family home prices
    making our apartments a more economical housing choice;

n

Strong economic growth leading to
    household formation and job growth, which in turn leads to high
    demand for our apartments; and

n

An attractive quality of life
    leading to high demand and retention and allowing us to more
    readily increase rents.

Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various
    sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow,
    issuance of additional equity and debt securities, sales of
    properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and
    uncollateralized borrowings. In addition, the Company may
    acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of
    limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership
    (“OP Units”) as consideration for the acquired
    properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances,
    enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the
    recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise
    result from the sales. EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold

and/or

sell
    based on market opportunities. The Company may also seek to
    acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt
    that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining
    title to property through foreclosure or

deed-in-lieu

of foreclosure proceedings. The Company has also, in the past,
    converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums
    but is not currently active in this line of business.

The Company primarily sources the funds for its new property
    acquisitions in its core markets with the sales proceeds from
    selling assets that are older or located in non-core markets.
    During the last five years, the Company has sold over 97,000
    apartment units for an aggregate sales price of
    $7.2 billion and acquired nearly 25,000 apartment units in
    its core markets for approximately $5.5 billion. We are
    currently acquiring and developing assets primarily in the
    following targeted metropolitan areas: Boston, New York,
    Washington DC, South Florida, Southern California,
    San Francisco, Seattle and to a lesser extent Denver. We
    also have investments (in the aggregate about 18% of our NOI) in
    other markets including Atlanta, Phoenix, Portland, Oregon, New
    England excluding Boston, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville but do
    not intend to acquire or develop assets in these markets.

As part of its strategy, the Company purchases completed and
    fully occupied apartment properties, partially completed or
    partially unoccupied properties or land on which apartment
    properties can be constructed. We intend to hold a diversified
    portfolio of assets across our target markets. Currently, no
    single metropolitan area accounts for more than 17% of our NOI,
    though no guarantee can be made that NOI concentration may not
    increase in the future.

We endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by
    providing them with the education, resources and opportunities
    to succeed. We provide many classroom and on-line training
    courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects
    and residents as well as extensively train our customer service
    specialists in maintaining the equipment and appliances on our
    property sites. We actively promote from within and many senior
    corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or
    junior positions. We monitor our employees’ engagement by
    surveying them annually and have consistently received high
    engagement scores.

We have a commitment to sustainability and consider the
    environmental impacts of our business activities. With its high
    density, multifamily housing is, by its nature, an
    environmentally friendly property type. Our recent acquisition
    and development activities have been primarily concentrated in
    pedestrian-friendly urban locations near public transportation.
    When developing and renovating our properties, we strive to
    reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving
    technology while positively impacting the experience of our
    residents and the value of our assets. We continue to implement
    a combination of irrigation, lighting and HVAC improvements at
    our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption.

During the first quarter of 2011 through January 13, 2011,
    the Company has issued approximately 3.0 million Common
    Shares at an average price of $50.84 per share for total

An unlimited amount of equity and debt securities remains
    available for issuance by EQR and the Operating Partnership
    under effective shelf registration statements filed with the
    SEC. Most recently, EQR and the Operating Partnership filed a
    universal shelf registration statement for an unlimited amount
    of equity and debt securities that became automatically
    effective upon filing with the SEC in October 2010 (under SEC
    regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement
    automatically expires on October 14, 2013 and does not
    contain a maximum issuance amount). However, as of
    February 16, 2011, issuances under the ATM share offering
    program are limited to 10,000,000 additional shares.

In May 2002, the Company’s shareholders approved the
    Company’s 2002 Share Incentive Plan. In January 2003,
    the Company filed a

Form S-8

registration statement to register 23,125,828 Common Shares
    under this plan. As of January 1, 2011,
    22,785,696 shares are the maximum shares issuable under
    this plan. See Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further discussion.

Credit
    Facilities

The Operating Partnership has a $1.425 billion (net of
    $75.0 million which had been committed by a now bankrupt
    financial institution and is not available for borrowing)
    unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on
    February 28, 2012, with the ability to increase available
    borrowings by an additional $500.0 million by adding
    additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of
    existing banks to increase their commitments. Advances under the
    credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR
    at various interest periods plus a spread (currently 0.50%)
    dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s credit rating or
    based on bids received from the lending group. EQR has
    guaranteed the Operating Partnership’s credit facility up
    to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.

As of December 31, 2010, the amount available on the credit
    facility was $1.28 billion (net of $147.3 million
    which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and
    net of the $75.0 million discussed above) and there was no
    amount outstanding. During the year ended December 31,
    2010, the weighted average interest rate was 0.66%. As of
    December 31, 2009, the amount available on the credit
    facility was $1.37 billion (net of $56.7 million which
    was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of
    the $75.0 million discussed above). The Company did not
    draw and had no balance outstanding on its revolving credit
    facility at any time during the year ended December 31,
    2009.

Competition

All of the Company’s properties are located in developed
    areas that include other multifamily properties. The number of
    competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could
    have a material effect on the Company’s ability to lease
    apartment units at the properties or at any newly acquired
    properties and on the rents charged. The Company may be
    competing with other entities that have greater resources than
    the Company and whose managers have more experience than the
    Company’s managers. In addition, other forms of rental
    properties and single family housing provide housing
    alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties.
    See Item 1A.

    Considerations

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

General

The following Risk Factors may contain defined terms that are
    different from those used in the other sections of this report.
    Unless otherwise indicated, when used in this section, the terms
    “we” and “us” refer to Equity Residential
    and its subsidiaries, including ERP Operating Limited
    Partnership. This Item 1A. includes forward-looking
    statements. You should refer to our discussion of the
    qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements
    included in Item 7.



The occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk
    factors could adversely affect, possibly in a material manner,
    our business, financial condition or results of operations,
    which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of
    beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest
    (which we refer to collectively as “Shares”), limited
    partnership interests in the Operating Partnership
    (“OP Units”) and Long Term Incentive Plan Units
    (“LTIP Units”). In this section, we refer to the
    Shares, OP Units and LTIP Units together as our
    “securities” and the investors who own Shares

and/or

OP/LTIP Units as our “security holders”.

Our Performance and Securities Value are Subject to Risks
    Associated with the Real Estate Industry

General

Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk
    and are relatively illiquid. Numerous factors may adversely
    affect the economic performance and value of our properties and
    the ability to realize that value. These factors include changes
    in the global, national, regional and local economic climates,
    local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties
    or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties, the
    attractiveness of our properties to residents, competition from
    other multifamily properties and single family homes and changes
    in market rental rates. Our performance also depends on our
    ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate
    maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real
    estate taxes, all of which could increase over time. Sources of
    labor and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital
    expenditure or development may be more expensive than
    anticipated. Also, the expenses of owning and operating a
    property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as
    market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from
    the property.

We May
    Not Have Sufficient Cash Flows From Operations After Capital
    Expenditures to Cover Our Distributions and Our New Dividend
    Policy May Lead to Quicker Dividend Reductions

We generally consider our cash flows provided by operating
    activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet
    operating requirements and payment of distributions to our
    security holders. However, there may be times when we experience
    shortfalls in our coverage of distributions, which may cause us
    to consider reducing our distributions

and/or

using
    the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing
    transactions to make up the difference. Should these shortfalls
    occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature, our
    financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be
    able to maintain our current distribution levels. While our new
    dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute, it
    will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly than in the
    past should operating results deteriorate. See Item 7 for
    additional discussion regarding our new dividend policy.

We May Be
    Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Apartment Units as Leases
    Expire

When our residents decide not to renew their leases upon
    expiration, we may not be able to relet their apartment units.
    Even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment
    units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable
    than current lease terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the
    leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon
    renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected
    rates, then our results of operations and financial condition
    will be adversely affected. Occupancy levels and market rents
    may be adversely affected by national and local economic and
    market conditions including, without limitation, new
    construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single
    family housing, slow or negative employment growth, availability
    of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers and the
    potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are beyond
    the Company’s control. In addition, various state and local
    municipalities are considering and may continue to consider rent
    control legislation which could limit our ability to raise
    rents. Finally, the federal government’s policies, many of
    which may encourage home ownership, can increase competition and
    possibly limit our ability to raise rents. Consequently, our
    cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to
    security holders could be reduced.

New
    Acquisitions and/or Development Projects May Fail to Perform as
    Expected and Competition for Acquisitions May Result in
    Increased Prices for Properties

We intend to actively acquire

and/or

develop multifamily properties for rental operations as market
    conditions dictate. We may also acquire multifamily properties
    that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up. We may
    be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule,
    resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues

and/or

lower
    yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than
    expected concessions. We may underestimate the costs necessary
    to bring an acquired property up to standards established for
    its intended market position or to complete a development
    property. Additionally, we expect that other major real estate
    investors with significant capital will compete with us for
    attractive investment opportunities or may also develop
    properties in markets where we focus our development efforts.
    This competition (or lack thereof) may



increase (or depress) prices for multifamily properties. We may
    not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to
    make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. The
    total number of development units, costs of development and
    estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising
    from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and
    construction materials), competition and local government
    regulation.

In connection with such government regulation, we may incur
    liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in
    compliance with the accessibility provisions of the Americans
    with Disabilities Act, the Fair Housing Act or other federal,
    state or local requirements. Noncompliance could result in
    fines, subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or
    repair the noncompliance.

Risks
    Involved in Real Estate Activity Through Joint
    Ventures

We have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire
    properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when
    we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures.
    Joint venture investments involve risks, including the
    possibility that our partners might refuse to make capital
    contributions when due; that we may be responsible to our
    partner for indemnifiable losses; that our partner might at any
    time have business or economic goals which are inconsistent with
    ours; and that our partner may be in a position to take action
    or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests.
    Frequently, we and our partner may each have the right to
    trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our
    interest, or acquire our partner’s interest, at a time when
    we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. In
    some instances, joint venture partners may have competing
    interests in our markets that could create conflicts of
    interest. Further, the Company’s joint venture partners may
    experience financial distress and to the extent they do not meet
    their obligations to us or our joint ventures with them, we may
    be adversely affected.

Because
    Real Estate Investments Are Illiquid, We May Not Be Able to Sell
    Properties When Appropriate

Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may
    not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to
    economic or other conditions. This inability to reallocate our
    capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition
    and ability to make distributions to our security holders.

The Value
    of Investment Securities Could Result In Losses to the
    Company

From time to time, the Company holds investment securities
    and/or cash investments that have a higher risk profile than the
    government obligations and bond funds, money market funds or
    bank deposits in which we generally invest. On occasion we may
    purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means
    to invest funds. There may be times when we experience declines
    in the value of these investment securities, which may result in
    losses to the Company and our financial condition or results of
    operations could be adversely affected. Sometimes the cash we
    deposit at a bank exceeds the FDIC insurance limit resulting in
    risk to the Company of loss of funds if these banks fail.

Changes
    in Market Conditions and Volatility of Share Prices Could
    Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our
    Common Shares

The stock markets, including the New York Stock Exchange, on
    which we list our Common Shares, have experienced significant
    price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of
    our Common Shares could be similarly volatile, and investors in
    our Common Shares may experience a decrease in the value of
    their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating
    performance or prospects. The market price of our Common Shares
    may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many
    factors, including but not limited to the following:

n

general market and economic
    conditions;

n

actual or anticipated
    variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends;

n

changes in our funds from
    operations, normalized funds from operations or earnings
    estimates;

n

difficulties or inability to
    access capital or extend or refinance debt;

n

decreasing (or uncertainty
    in) real estate valuations;

n

a change in analyst ratings;

n

adverse market reaction to
    any additional debt we incur in the future;

n

governmental regulatory
    action, including changes or proposed changes to the mandates of
    Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and changes in tax laws; and

n

the issuance of additional
    Common Shares, or the perception that such issuances might
    occur, including under our ATM program.



Changes
    in Laws and Litigation Risk Could Affect Our Business

We are generally not able to pass through to our residents under
    existing leases any real estate or other federal, state or local
    taxes. Consequently, any such tax increases may adversely affect
    our financial condition and limit our ability to make
    distributions to our security holders.

We may become involved in legal proceedings, including but not
    limited to, proceedings related to consumer, employment,
    development, condominium conversion, tort and commercial legal
    issues that, if decided adversely to or settled by us, could
    result in liability material to our financial condition or
    results of operations.

Any
    Weaknesses Identified in Our Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Share
    Price

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us
    to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial
    reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our
    internal control over financial reporting, we could lose
    investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our
    financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on
    our share price.

Environmental
    Problems Are Possible and Can Be Costly

Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment may require a current or previous
    owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up
    hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at
    such property. The owner or operator may have to pay a
    governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for
    investigation and

clean-up

costs incurred by such parties in connection with the
    contamination. These laws typically impose

clean-up

responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner
    or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants.
    Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the
    contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may
    be held responsible for all of the

clean-up

costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or
    operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from
    environmental contamination emanating from that site.

Substantially all of our properties have been the subject of
    environmental assessments completed by qualified independent
    environmental consulting companies. While these environmental
    assessments have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any
    environmental liability that our management believes would have
    a material adverse effect on our business, results of
    operations, financial condition or liquidity, there can be no
    assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future.

There have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners
    and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury
    and property damage caused by the presence of mold in
    residential real estate. As some of these lawsuits have resulted
    in substantial monetary judgments or settlements, insurance
    carriers have reacted by excluding mold-related claims from
    standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively
    high rates. While we have adopted programs designed to minimize
    the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as
    guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold
    to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the
    property, should mold become an issue in the future, our
    financial condition or results of operations may be adversely
    affected.

We cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of
    our properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any
    prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material
    environmental condition not known to us, or that a material
    environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of
    our properties.

Climate
    Change

To the extent that climate change does occur, we may experience
    extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature,
    all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in
    demand for properties located in these areas or affected by
    these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be
    material in nature, including destruction of our properties, or
    occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or
    results of operations may be adversely affected.

In addition, changes in federal and state legislation and
    regulation on climate change could result in increased capital
    expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing
    properties and could also require us to spend more on our new
    development properties without a corresponding increase in
    revenue.



Insurance
    Policy Deductibles, Exclusions and Counterparties

As of December 31, 2010, the Company’s property
    insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of
    $250,000 and self-insured retention of $5.0 million per
    occurrence, subject to a maximum annual aggregate self-insured
    retention of $7.5 million, with approximately 80% of any
    excess losses being covered by insurance. Any earthquake and
    named windstorm losses are subject to a deductible of 5% of the
    values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not
    subject to the aggregate self-insured retention. The
    Company’s general liability and worker’s compensation
    policies at December 31, 2010 provide for a
    $2.0 million and $1.0 million per occurrence
    deductible, respectively. These higher deductible and
    self-insured retention amounts do expose the Company to greater
    potential uninsured losses, but management has reviewed its
    claims history over the years and believes the savings in
    insurance premium expense justify this potential increased
    exposure over the long-term. However, the potential impact of
    climate change and increased severe weather could cause a
    significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles,
    particularly for our coastal properties, or a decrease in the
    availability of coverage, either of which could expose the
    Company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely
    affect our financial condition or results of operations.

As a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
    property insurance carriers created exclusions for losses from
    terrorism from our “all risk” property insurance
    policies. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was insured
    for $500.0 million in terrorism insurance coverage, with a
    $100,000 deductible. This coverage excludes losses from nuclear,
    biological and chemical attacks. In the event of a terrorist
    attack impacting one or more of our properties, we could lose
    the revenues from the property, our capital investment in the
    property and possibly face liability claims from residents or
    others suffering injuries or losses. The Company has become more
    susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio,
    becoming more concentrated in fewer, more valuable assets over a
    smaller geographical footprint.

In addition, the Company relies on third party insurance
    providers for its property, general liability and worker’s
    compensation insurance. While there has yet to be any
    non-performance by these major insurance providers, should any
    of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress,
    it could negatively impact the Company.

Non-Performance
    by Our Operating Counterparties Could Adversely Affect Our
    Performance

We have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute
    transactions with or receive services from many counterparties.
    As a result, defaults by counterparties could result in services
    not being provided, or volatility in the financial markets could
    affect counterparties’ ability to complete transactions
    with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions
    to our operations that may adversely affect our business and
    results of operations.

Debt Financing and Preferred Shares Could Adversely
    Affect Our Performance

General

Please refer to Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

,
    for the Company’s total debt and unsecured debt summaries
    as of December 31, 2010.

In addition to debt, we have $200.0 million of combined
    liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial
    interest with a weighted average dividend preference of 6.93%
    per annum as of December 31, 2010. Our use of debt and
    preferred equity financing creates certain risks, including the
    following:

Disruptions
    in the Financial Markets Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to
    Obtain Debt Financing and Impact our Acquisitions and
    Dispositions

Dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit
    markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets, resulting in
    financing terms that are less attractive to us

and/or

the
    unavailability of certain types of debt financing. Should the
    capital and credit markets experience volatility and the
    availability of funds again become limited, or be available only
    on unattractive terms, we will incur increased costs associated
    with issuing debt instruments. In addition, it is possible that
    our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be
    limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we
    would like, or need, to do so, which would adversely impact our
    ability to refinance maturing debt

and/or

react
    to changing economic and business conditions. Uncertainty in the
    credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make
    acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us
    to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive
    for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may
    experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in
    obtaining debt financing. Potential continued disruptions in



the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse
    effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price
    of our Common Shares to fluctuate significantly

and/or

to
    decline.

Potential
    Reforms to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Could Adversely Affect Our
    Performance

There is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Should Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
    have their mandates changed or reduced, be disbanded or
    reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinue providing
    liquidity to our sector, it would significantly reduce our
    access to debt capital

and/or

increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our
    sales of assets and/or the values realized upon sale.
    Disruptions in the floating rate tax-exempt bond market (where
    interest rates reset weekly) and in the credit market’s
    perception of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee and
    provide liquidity for these bonds, have been experienced in the
    past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an
    increase in interest rates on these debt obligations. These
    bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if
    Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac fail to satisfy their guaranty
    obligations. While this obligation is in almost all cases
    non-recourse to us, this could cause the Company to have to
    repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure
    actions on the collateralized assets.

Non-Performance
    by Our Financial Counterparties Could Adversely Affect Our
    Performance

Although we have not experienced any material counterparty
    non-performance, disruptions in financial and credit markets
    could, among other things, impede the ability of our
    counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations.
    There are multiple financial institutions that are individually
    committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving
    credit facility. Should any of these institutions fail to fund
    their committed amounts when contractually required, our
    financial condition could be adversely affected. Should several
    of these institutions fail to fund, we could experience
    significant financial distress. One of the financial
    institutions, with a commitment of $75.0 million, declared
    bankruptcy in 2008 and will not honor its financial commitment.
    Our borrowing capacity under the credit facility has in essence
    been permanently reduced to $1.425 billion.

The Company also has developed assets with joint venture
    partners which were financed by financial institutions that have
    experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could
    experience similar distress as economic conditions change. If
    one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually
    required, the Company or its joint venture partner may be unable
    to complete construction of its development properties.

A
    Significant Downgrade in Our Credit Ratings Could Adversely
    Affect Our Performance

A significant downgrade in our credit ratings, while not
    affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving
    credit facility, would cause our borrowing costs to increase
    under the facility and impact our ability to borrow secured and
    unsecured debt, or otherwise limit our access to capital. In
    addition, a downgrade below investment grade would require us to
    post cash collateral

and/or

letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to
    cover our self-insured property and liability insurance
    deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant
    with the lenders’ requirements at the lower rating level.

Scheduled
    Debt Payments Could Adversely Affect Our Financial
    Condition

In the future, our cash flow could be insufficient to meet
    required payments of principal and interest or to pay
    distributions on our securities at expected levels.

We may not be able to refinance existing debt, including joint
    venture indebtedness (which in virtually all cases requires
    substantial principal payments at maturity) and, if we can, the
    terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms
    of existing indebtedness. If principal payments due at maturity
    cannot be refinanced, extended or paid with proceeds of other
    capital transactions, such as new equity capital, our operating
    cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all
    maturing debt. As a result, certain of our other debt may cross
    default, we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures
    necessary for the maintenance of our properties, we may have to
    dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise
    be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage
    holder to foreclose on a property. Foreclosure on mortgaged
    properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness
    would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition
    and results of operations.



Please refer to Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

,
    for the Company’s debt maturity schedule as of
    December 31, 2010.

Financial
    Covenants Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Financial
    Condition

The mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative
    covenants that, among other things, limit our ability, without
    the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the
    property and to reduce or change insurance coverage. In
    addition, our unsecured credit facilities contain certain
    restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability
    to incur debt. The indentures under which a substantial portion
    of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial
    and operating covenants including, among other things,
    maintenance of certain financial ratios, as well as limitations
    on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt (including
    acquisition financing), and to sell all or substantially all of
    our assets. Our credit facilities and indentures are
    cross-defaulted and also contain cross default provisions with
    other material debt. While the Company believes it was in
    compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, should it fall out
    of compliance, it would likely have a negative impact on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

Some of the properties were financed with tax-exempt bonds that
    contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions. We
    have retained an independent outside consultant to monitor
    compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions
    that affect these properties. If these bond compliance
    requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates
    to low or moderate-income residents, or eligible/qualified
    residents, then our income from these properties may be limited.
    While we generally believe that the interest rate benefit
    attendant to properties with tax-exempt bonds more than
    outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or
    deed restrictions, this may not always be the case.

Our
    Degree of Leverage Could Limit Our Ability to Obtain Additional
    Financing

Our degree of leverage could have important consequences to
    security holders. For example, the degree of leverage could
    affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future
    for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
    development or other general corporate purposes, making us more
    vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general.
    Our consolidated

debt-to-total

market capitalization ratio was 38.4% as of December 31,
    2010. In addition, our most restrictive unsecured public debt
    covenants are as follows:

Rising
    Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow

Advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable
    rates based upon LIBOR at various interest periods, plus a
    spread dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s credit
    rating, or based upon bids received from the lending group.
    Certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt
    instruments may also, from time to time, bear interest at
    floating rates. We may also borrow additional money with
    variable interest rates in the future. Increases in interest
    rates would increase our interest expense under these debt
    instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing
    debt and of issuing new debt. Accordingly, higher interest rates
    could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our
    debt and make distributions to security holders.

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activity Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow

In the normal course of business, we use derivatives to manage
    our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments,
    including hedging for future debt issuances. At other times we
    may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating
    interest rates. There can be no assurance that these hedging
    arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact. These
    arrangements, which can include a number of counterparties, may
    expose us to additional risks, including failure of any of our
    counterparties to



perform under these contracts, and may involve extensive costs,
    such as transaction fees or breakage costs, if we terminate
    them. No strategy can completely insulate us from the risks
    associated with interest rate fluctuations.

We Depend
    on Our Key Personnel

We depend on the efforts of the Chairman of our Board of
    Trustees, Samuel Zell, and our executive officers, particularly
    David J. Neithercut, our President and Chief Executive Officer
    (“CEO”). If they resign or otherwise cease to be
    employed by us, our operations could be temporarily adversely
    affected. Mr. Zell has entered into retirement benefit and
    noncompetition agreements with the Company.

Control
    and Influence by Significant Shareholders Could Be Exercised in
    a Manner Adverse to Other Shareholders

The consent of certain affiliates of Mr. Zell is required
    for certain amendments to the Sixth Amended and Restated
    Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership
    (the “Partnership Agreement”). As a result of their
    security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the
    Partnership Agreement, the security holders referred to herein
    may have influence over the Company. Although to the
    Company’s knowledge these security holders have not agreed
    to act together on any matter, they would be in a position to
    exercise even more influence over the Company’s affairs if
    they were to act together in the future. This influence could
    conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with
    the interests of other security holders. For additional
    information regarding the security ownership of our trustees,
    including Mr. Zell, and our executive officers, see the
    Company’s definitive proxy statement.

Shareholders’ Ability to Effect Changes in Control of
    the Company is Limited

Provisions
    of Our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws Could Inhibit Changes in
    Control

Certain provisions of our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws may
    delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or other
    transactions that could provide the security holders with a
    premium over the then-prevailing market price of their
    securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of
    our security holders. This includes the 5% Ownership Limit
    described below. While our existing preferred shares do not have
    these provisions, any future series of preferred shares may have
    certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change
    in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the
    interest of our security holders. Our Bylaws require certain
    information to be provided by any security holder, or persons
    acting in concert with such security holder, who proposes
    business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders,
    including disclosure of information related to hedging
    activities and investment strategies with respect to our
    securities. These requirements could delay or prevent a change
    in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the
    interest of our security holders.

We Have a
    Share Ownership Limit for REIT Tax Purposes

To remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
    not more than 50% in value of our outstanding Shares may be
    owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at
    any time during the last half of any year. To facilitate
    maintenance of our REIT qualification, our Declaration of Trust,
    subject to certain exceptions, prohibits ownership by any single
    shareholder of more than 5% of the lesser of the number or value
    of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares. We refer
    to this restriction as the “Ownership Limit.” Absent
    any exemption or waiver granted by our Board of Trustees,
    securities acquired or held in violation of the Ownership Limit
    will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a
    designated charitable beneficiary, and the security
    holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would
    terminate. A transfer of Shares may be void if it causes a
    person to violate the Ownership Limit. The Ownership Limit could
    delay or prevent a change in control and, therefore, could
    adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a
    premium over the then-prevailing market price for their Shares.
    To reduce the ability of the Board to use the Ownership Limit as
    an anti-takeover device, the Company’s Ownership Limit
    requires, rather than permits, the Board to grant a waiver of
    the Ownership Limit if the individual seeking a waiver
    demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the
    Company’s status as a REIT.

Our
    Preferred Shares May Affect Changes in Control

Our Declaration of Trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to
    issue up to 100 million preferred shares, and to establish
    the preferences and rights (including the right to vote and the
    right to convert into common shares) of any preferred shares
    issued. The Board of Trustees may use its powers to issue
    preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to
    delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even if a
    change in control were in the interest of security holders.



Inapplicability
    of Maryland Law Limiting Certain Changes in Control

Certain provisions of Maryland law applicable to real estate
    investment trusts prohibit “business combinations”
    (including certain issuances of equity securities) with any
    person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting
    power of outstanding securities, or with an affiliate who, at
    any time within the two-year period prior to the date in
    question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the
    voting power of the Company’s outstanding voting securities
    (an “Interested Shareholder”), or with an affiliate of
    an Interested Shareholder. These prohibitions last for five
    years after the most recent date on which the Interested
    Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder. After the
    five-year period, a business combination with an Interested
    Shareholder must be approved by two super-majority shareholder
    votes unless, among other conditions, holders of common shares
    receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration
    is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by
    the Interested Shareholder for its common shares. As permitted
    by Maryland law, however, the Board of Trustees of the Company
    has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business
    combination involving Mr. Zell and certain of his
    affiliates and persons acting in concert with them.
    Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority
    vote requirements will not apply to a business combination
    involving us

and/or

any
    of them. Such business combinations may not be in the best
    interest of our security holders.

Our Success as a REIT Is Dependent on Compliance with Federal
    Income Tax Requirements

Our
    Failure to Qualify as a REIT Would Have Serious Adverse
    Consequences to Our Security Holders

We believe that we have qualified for taxation as a REIT for
    federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended
    December 31, 1992 based, in part, upon opinions of tax
    counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or
    engaged in significant merger transactions. We plan to continue
    to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these
    requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. We
    cannot, therefore, guarantee that we have qualified or will
    qualify in the future as a REIT. The determination that we are a
    REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters that may
    not be totally within our control. For example, to qualify as a
    REIT, our gross income must generally come from rental and other
    real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the
    REIT tax laws. We are also required to distribute to security
    holders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income excluding
    capital gains. The fact that we hold our assets through ERP
    Operating Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries further
    complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a
    technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT
    status. Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to
    the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new
    rulings that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to
    remain qualified as a REIT. We do not believe, however, that any
    pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our REIT
    status. In addition, Congress and the IRS have recently
    liberalized the REIT qualification rules to permit REITs in
    certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent
    mistakes rather than lose REIT status.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal
    income tax at regular corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS
    granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would
    remain disqualified from taxation as a REIT for four years
    following the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT. If
    we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would have to pay significant
    income taxes. We, therefore, would have less money available for
    investments or for distributions to security holders. This would
    likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our
    securities. In addition, we would no longer be required to make
    any distributions to security holders. Even if we qualify as a
    REIT, we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal,
    state and local taxes on our income and property. In addition,
    our corporate housing business, which is conducted through
    taxable REIT subsidiaries, generally will be subject to federal
    and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent
    they have taxable income.

We Could
    Be Disqualified as a REIT or Have to Pay Taxes if Our Merger
    Partners Did Not Qualify as REITs

If any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a
    REIT throughout the duration of their existence, then they might
    have had undistributed “C corporation earnings and
    profits” at the time of their merger with us. If that was
    the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits
    prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place, we
    might not qualify as a REIT. We believe based, in part, upon
    opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our
    merger agreements as well as our own investigations, among other
    things, that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a
    REIT and that, in any event, none of them had any undistributed
    “C corporation earnings and profits” at the time of
    their merger with us. If any of our prior merger partners failed
    to qualify as a REIT, an additional concern would be that they
    could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time
    they merged with us. We would be liable for the tax on such
    gain. We also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain
    existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired
    in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the
    merger.



Compliance with REIT Distribution Requirements May Affect Our
    Financial Condition

Distribution
    Requirements May Increase the Indebtedness of the
    Company

We may be required from time to time, under certain
    circumstances, to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and
    rent earned but not yet received. In such event, or upon our
    repayment of principal on debt, we could have taxable income
    without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution
    requirements of a REIT. Accordingly, we could be required to
    borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order
    to meet these distribution requirements.

Tax
    Elections Regarding Distributions May Impact Future Liquidity of
    the Company

During 2008 and 2009, we did make, and under certain
    circumstances may consider making again in the future, a tax
    election to treat future distributions to shareholders as
    distributions in the current year. This election, which is
    provided for in the REIT tax code, may allow us to avoid
    increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in
    the current year. However, this could result in a constraint on
    our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without
    creating risk of either violating the REIT distribution
    requirements or generating additional income tax liability.

Federal
    Income Tax Considerations

General

The following discussion summarizes the federal income tax
    considerations material to a holder of common shares. It is not
    exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. For example, it
    does not give a detailed discussion of any state, local or
    foreign tax considerations. The following discussion also does
    not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective
    shareholders in light of their particular circumstances.
    Moreover, it does not address all tax matters that may be
    relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment
    under the tax laws, such as insurance companies, tax-exempt
    entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers, foreign
    corporations, persons who are not citizens or residents of the
    United States and persons who own shares through a partnership
    or other entity treated as a flow-through entity for federal
    income tax purposes.

The specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could
    have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with
    the purchase, ownership and disposition of common shares.
    Therefore, it is essential that each prospective shareholder
    consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the
    application of the federal income tax laws to the
    shareholder’s personal tax situation, as well as any tax
    consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or
    foreign taxing jurisdiction.

The information in this section is based on the current Internal
    Revenue Code, current, temporary and proposed Treasury
    regulations, the legislative history of the Internal Revenue
    Code, current administrative interpretations and practices of
    the Internal Revenue Service, including its practices and
    policies as set forth in private letter rulings, which are not
    binding on the Internal Revenue Service, and existing court
    decisions. Future legislation, regulations, administrative
    interpretations and court decisions could change current law or
    adversely affect existing interpretations of current law. Any
    change could apply retroactively. Thus, it is possible that the
    Internal Revenue Service could challenge the statements in this
    discussion, which do not bind the Internal Revenue Service or
    the courts, and that a court could agree with the Internal
    Revenue Service.

Our
    Taxation

We elected REIT status beginning with the year that ended
    December 31, 1992. In any year in which we qualify as a
    REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on
    the portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gain that we
    distribute to our shareholders. This treatment substantially
    eliminates the double taxation that applies to most
    corporations, which pay a tax on their income and then
    distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on
    the amount they receive. We elected taxable REIT subsidiary
    status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries, primarily
    those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities. As
    a result, we will be subject to federal income taxes for
    activities performed by our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

We will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate
    rates upon our REIT taxable income or capital gains that we do
    not distribute to our shareholders. In addition, we will be
    subject to a 4% excise tax if we do not satisfy specific REIT
    distribution requirements. We could also be subject to the
    “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax
    preference. In addition, any net income from “prohibited
    transactions” (i.e., dispositions of property, other than
    property held by a taxable REIT subsidiary, held primarily for
    sale to customers in the ordinary course of business) will be
    subject to a 100% tax. We could also be



subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain payments received from
    or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable REIT subsidiary if
    any such transaction is not respected by the Internal Revenue
    Service. If we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the
    95% gross income test (described below) but have maintained our
    qualification as a REIT because we satisfied certain other
    requirements, we will still generally be subject to a 100%
    penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross
    income that caused the income test failure. If we fail to
    satisfy any of the REIT asset tests (described below) by more
    than a

de minimis

amount, due to reasonable cause, and we
    nonetheless maintain our REIT qualification because of specified
    cure provisions, we will be required to pay a tax equal to the
    greater of $50,000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate
    multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying
    assets. If we fail to satisfy any provision of the Internal
    Revenue Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a
    REIT (other than a violation of the REIT gross income or asset
    tests described below) and the violation is due to reasonable
    cause, we may retain our REIT qualification but we will be
    required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure.
    Moreover, we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and
    on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate.

We believe that we have qualified as a REIT for all of our
    taxable years beginning with 1992. We also believe that our
    current structure and method of operation is such that we will
    continue to qualify as a REIT. However, given the complexity of
    the REIT qualification requirements, we cannot provide any
    assurance that the actual results of our operations have
    satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the Internal
    Revenue Code for a particular year.

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year
    and the relief provisions described herein do not apply, we will
    be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate
    rates. We also may be subject to the corporate “alternative
    minimum tax.” As a result, our failure to qualify as a REIT
    would significantly reduce the cash we have available to
    distribute to our shareholders. Unless entitled to statutory
    relief, we would not be able to re-elect to be taxed as a REIT
    until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification.
    It is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to
    statutory relief.

Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our ability
    to satisfy various requirements under the Internal Revenue Code.
    We are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing
    basis through actual annual operating and other results.
    Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
    continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a
    REIT.

Ownership of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries by Us

. The
    Internal Revenue Code provides that REITs may own greater than
    ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a
    “taxable REIT subsidiary” or “TRS”, provided
    that the aggregate value of all of the TRS securities held by
    the REIT does not exceed 25% of the REIT’s total asset
    value. TRSs are corporations subject to tax as a regular
    “C” corporation that have elected, jointly with a
    REIT, to be a TRS. Generally, a taxable REIT subsidiary may own
    assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a REIT and can perform
    impermissible tenant services (discussed below), which would
    otherwise taint our rental income under the REIT income tests.
    However, the REIT will be obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on
    some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by
    our TRSs if the economic arrangements between us, our tenants
    and the TRS are not comparable to similar arrangements among
    unrelated parties. A TRS may also receive income from prohibited
    transactions without incurring the 100% federal income tax
    liability imposed on REITs. Income from prohibited transactions
    may include the purchase and sale of land, the purchase and sale
    of completed development properties and the sale of condominium
    units.

TRSs pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable
    corporate rates. The amount of taxes paid on impermissible
    tenant services income and the sale of real estate held
    primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of
    business may be material in amount. The TRSs will attempt to
    reduce, if possible, the amount of these taxes, but we cannot
    guarantee whether, or the extent to which, measures taken to
    reduce these taxes will be successful. To the extent that these
    companies are required to pay taxes, less cash may be available
    for distributions to shareholders.

Share Ownership Test and Organizational
    Requirement

. In order to qualify as a REIT, our shares
    of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of
    100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year
    that is 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a
    taxable year of less than 12 months. Also, not more than
    50% in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned
    directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive
    ownership rules, by five or fewer individuals during the last
    half of each taxable year. In addition, we must meet certain
    other organizational requirements, including, but not limited
    to, that (i) the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by
    transferable shares and (ii) we are managed by one or more
    trustees. We believe that we have satisfied all of these tests
    and all other organizational requirements and that we will
    continue to do so in the future. In order to ensure compliance
    with the 100 person test and the 50% share ownership test
    discussed above, we have placed certain restrictions on the
    transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further
    concentration of share ownership. However, such restrictions may
    not prevent us from failing these requirements, and thereby
    failing to qualify as a REIT.



Gross Income Tests

. To qualify as a REIT, we must
    satisfy two gross income tests:

(1)

At least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year must be
    derived directly or indirectly from rents from real property,
    investments in real estate

and/or

real
    estate mortgages, dividends paid by another REIT and from some
    types of temporary investments (excluding certain hedging
    income).

(2)

At least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year must be
    derived from any combination of income qualifying under the 75%
    test and dividends, non-real estate mortgage interest and gain
    from the sale or disposition of stock or securities (excluding
    certain hedging income).

To qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of
    satisfying the gross income tests, rental payments must
    generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on
    the net income of the resident. Also, the rent attributable to
    personal property must not exceed 15% of the total rent. We may
    generally provide services to residents without
    “tainting” our rental income only if such services are
    “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with
    the rental of real property and not otherwise considered
    “impermissible services”. If such services are
    impermissible, then we may generally provide them only if they
    are considered de minimis in amount, or are provided through an
    independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that
    meets other requirements, or through a taxable REIT subsidiary.
    We believe that services provided to residents by us either are
    usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of
    real property and not otherwise considered impermissible, or, if
    considered impermissible services, will meet the

de minimis

test or will be provided by an independent contractor or
    taxable REIT subsidiary. However, we cannot provide any
    assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with
    these positions.

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for
    any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for the
    year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of
    the Internal Revenue Code. In this case, a penalty tax would
    still be applicable as discussed above. Generally, it is not
    possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be
    entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the
    event these relief provisions do not apply, we will not qualify
    as a REIT.

Asset Tests

. In general, at the close of each
    quarter of our taxable year, we must satisfy four tests relating
    to the nature of our assets:

(1)

At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be
    represented by real estate assets (which include for this
    purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts) and
    certain cash related items;

(2)

Not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be
    represented by securities other than those in the 75% asset
    class;

(3)

Except for securities included in item 1 above, equity
    investments in other REITs, qualified REIT subsidiaries (i.e.,
    corporations owned 100% by a REIT that are not TRSs or REITs),
    or taxable REIT subsidiaries: (a) the value of any one
    issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the
    value of our total assets and (b) we may not own securities
    representing more than 10% of the voting power or value of the
    outstanding securities of any one issuer; and

(4)

Not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be
    represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT
    subsidiaries.

The 10% value test described in clause (3) (b) above does
    not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor
    under the Code. Under the safe harbor, the following are not
    considered “securities” held by us for purposes of
    this 10% value test: (i) straight debt securities,
    (ii) any loan of an individual or an estate,
    (iii) certain rental agreements for the use of tangible
    property, (iv) any obligation to pay rents from real
    property, (v) any security issued by a state or any
    political subdivision thereof, foreign government or Puerto Rico
    only if the determination of any payment under such security is
    not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any
    obligation issued by such other entity, or (vi) any
    security issued by a REIT. The timing and payment of interest or
    principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be
    subject to a contingency provided that (A) such contingency
    does not change the effective yield to maturity, not considering
    a

de minimis

change which does not exceed the greater of
    1/4 of 1% or 5% of the annual yield to maturity or we own
    $1,000,000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the
    particular issuer’s debt and not more than 12 months
    of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or
    (B) the contingency is consistent with commercial practice
    and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise
    of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt. If we hold
    indebtedness from any issuer, including a REIT, the indebtedness
    will be subject to, and may cause a violation of, the asset
    tests, unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise
    satisfies the above safe harbor. We currently own equity
    interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as
    REITs for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly
    traded. If any such entity were to fail to qualify as a REIT, we
    would not meet the 10% voting stock limitation and the 10% value
    limitation and we would, unless certain relief provisions
    applied, fail to qualify as a REIT. We believe that we and each
    of the



REITs we own an interest in have and will comply with the
    foregoing asset tests for REIT qualification. However, we cannot
    provide any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will
    agree with our determinations.

If we fail to satisfy the 5% or 10% asset tests described above
    after a

30-day

cure
    period provided in the Internal Revenue Code, we will be deemed
    to have met such tests if the value of our non-qualifying assets
    is

de minimis

(i.e., does not exceed the lesser of 1% of
    the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable
    quarter or $10,000,000) and we dispose of the non-qualifying
    assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in
    which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered. For
    violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that
    are in excess of the

de minimis

exception described
    above, we may avoid disqualification as a REIT under any of the
    asset tests, after the

30-day

cure
    period, by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test
    within such six month period, paying a tax equal to the greater
    of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the
    net income generated by the non-qualifying assets and disclosing
    certain information to the Internal Revenue Service. If we
    cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions, or if we fail
    to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests, we would
    cease to qualify as a REIT.

Annual Distribution Requirements

. To qualify as a
    REIT, we are generally required to distribute dividends, other
    than capital gain dividends, to our shareholders each year in an
    amount at least equal to 90% of our REIT taxable income. These
    distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which
    they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before
    we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid
    with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the
    declaration is made. We intend to make timely distributions
    sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements. To
    the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain
    or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our REIT
    taxable income, as adjusted, we are subject to tax on these
    amounts at regular corporate rates. We will be subject to a 4%
    excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the
    sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for
    which federal income tax was paid, if we fail to distribute
    during each calendar year at least the sum of: (1) 85% of
    our REIT ordinary income for the year; (2) 95% of our REIT
    capital gain net income for the year; and (3) any
    undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years. A REIT
    may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of
    its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains. In that
    case, a REIT may elect to have its shareholders include their
    proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in
    income as long-term capital gains and receive a credit for their
    share of the tax paid by the REIT. For purposes of the 4% excise
    tax described above, any retained amounts would be treated as
    having been distributed.

Ownership of Partnership Interests By Us

. As a
    result of our ownership of the Operating Partnership, we will be
    considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the
    assets and items of income of the Operating Partnership,
    respectively, for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests,
    including its share of assets and items of income of any
    subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability
    companies.

State and Local Taxes

. We may be subject to state or
    local taxation in various jurisdictions, including those in
    which we transact business or reside. Generally REITs have seen
    increases in state and local taxes in recent years. Our state
    and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income
    tax treatment discussed above. Consequently, prospective
    shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the
    effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common
    shares.

Taxation
    of Domestic Shareholders Subject to U.S. Tax

General

. If we qualify as a REIT, distributions made
    to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their
    common shares, other than capital gain distributions and
    distributions attributable to taxable REIT subsidiaries, will be
    treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions
    come out of earnings and profits. These distributions will not
    be eligible for the dividends received deduction for
    shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute
    “qualified dividend income” under the Internal Revenue
    Code, meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal
    rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special
    capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend
    income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable
    holding period requirements. In determining whether
    distributions are out of earnings and profits, we will allocate
    our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to
    the common shares. The portion of ordinary dividends which
    represent ordinary dividends we receive from a TRS, will be
    designated as “qualified dividend income” to REIT
    shareholders. For tax years ending on or before
    December 31, 2012, these qualified dividends are eligible
    for preferential tax rates if paid to our non-corporate
    shareholders.

To the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic
    shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits, such
    distributions will be considered a return of capital. Such
    distributions will be treated as a tax-free distribution and
    will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares
    by the amount of the distribution so treated. To the extent such
    distributions



cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax
    basis, such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of
    shares. Shareholders may not include in their individual income
    tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses.

Dividends declared by a REIT in October, November, or December
    are deemed to have been paid by the REIT and received by its
    shareholders on December 31 of that year, so long as the
    dividends are actually paid during January of the following
    year. However, this treatment only applies to the extent of the
    REIT’s earnings and profits existing on December 31.
    To the extent the shareholder distribution paid in January
    exceeds available earnings and profits as of December 31,
    the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to
    shareholders in the year paid. As such, for tax reporting
    purposes, January distributions paid to our shareholders may be
    split between two tax years.

Distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital
    gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders
    as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for
    more than one year. This treatment applies only to the extent
    that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net
    capital gain for the taxable year. It applies regardless of the
    period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her
    common shares. Despite this general rule, corporate shareholders
    may be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain
    dividends as ordinary income.

Generally, we will classify a portion of our designated capital
    gain dividends as a 15% rate gain distribution and the remaining
    portion as an unrecaptured Section 1250 gain distribution.
    A 15% rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable
    domestic shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts at
    a maximum rate of 15% (which 15% rate is currently scheduled to
    increase to 20% for taxable years beginning on and after
    January 1, 2013). An unrecaptured Section 1250 gain
    distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders
    that are individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25%.

If, for any taxable year, we elect to designate as capital gain
    dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available
    for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial
    interest, then the portion of the capital gains dividends that
    will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the
    total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction. The
    numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or
    made available to the holders of the common shares for the year.
    The denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid
    or made available to holders of all classes of shares of
    beneficial interest.

We may elect to retain (rather than distribute as is generally
    required) net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income
    tax on that gain. If we make this election, shareholders must
    include in income, as long-term capital gain, their
    proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain.
    Shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate
    share of the tax paid by us on these gains. Accordingly, they
    will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount. Shareholders
    will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference
    between the amount of capital gain included in their income and
    the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid. Our
    earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately.

In general, a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for
    federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of
    common shares in an amount equal to the difference between:

(a)

the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property
    received in the sale or other disposition; and

(b)

the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares.

The gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common
    shares were held as a capital asset. Generally, the capital gain
    or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the common
    shares were held for more than one year.

In general, a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of
    common shares that were held for six months or less, determined
    after applying certain holding period rules, will be treated as
    long-term capital loss to the extent that the shareholder
    received distributions that were treated as long-term capital
    gains. For shareholders who are individuals, trusts and estates,
    the long-term capital loss will be apportioned among the
    applicable long-term capital gain rates to the extent that
    distributions received by the shareholder were previously so
    treated.

Taxation
    of Domestic Tax-Exempt Shareholders

Most tax-exempt organizations are not subject to federal income
    tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable
    income, which is often referred to as UBTI. Unless a tax-exempt
    shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or
    uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business,
    distributions to the shareholder should not constitute UBTI.
    Similarly, if a tax-exempt shareholder sells common shares, the
    income from the sale should not constitute UBTI unless the
    shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used
    the shares in a trade or business.



However, for tax-exempt shareholders that are social clubs,
    voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental
    unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified group legal services
    plans, income from owning or selling common shares will
    constitute UBTI unless the organization is able to properly
    deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset
    the income generated by its investment in common shares. These
    shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning
    these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in
    the Internal Revenue Code.

In addition, certain pension trusts that own more than 10% of a
    “pension-held REIT” must report a portion of the
    distributions that they receive from the REIT as UBTI. We have
    not been and do not expect to be treated as a pension-held REIT
    for purposes of this rule.

Taxation
    of Foreign Shareholders

The following is a discussion of certain anticipated United
    States federal income tax consequences of the ownership and
    disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign
    shareholder. For purposes of this discussion, a “foreign
    shareholder” is any person other than:

(a)

a citizen or resident of the United States;

(b)

a corporation or partnership created or organized in the United
    States or under the laws of the United States or of any state
    thereof; or

(c)

an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income
    for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its
    source.

Distributions by Us

. Distributions by us to a
    foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from
    sales or exchanges by us of United States real property
    interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will
    be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that
    they are made out of our earnings and profits. These
    distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of
    United States federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30% rate,
    or a lower treaty rate, unless the dividends are treated as
    effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign
    shareholder of a United States trade or business. Please note
    that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally
    applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from REITs.
    Dividends that are effectively connected with a United States
    trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at
    graduated rates, and are generally not subject to withholding.
    Certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied
    before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this
    exemption. A foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may
    be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or
    a lower treaty rate.

We expect to withhold United States income tax at the rate of
    30% on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder
    unless:

(a)

a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or
    certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is
    filed with us; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder files an IRS

Form W-8ECI

with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected
    income.

If such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated
    earnings and profits, it will not be taxable to a foreign
    shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed
    the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares.
    Instead, the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the
    common shares. To the extent that the distribution exceeds the
    adjusted basis of the common shares, it will give rise to gain
    from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common
    shares. The tax treatment of this gain is described below.

We intend to withhold at a rate of 30%, or a lower applicable
    treaty rate, on the entire amount of any distribution not
    designated as a capital gain distribution. In such event, a
    foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount
    from the IRS if it is subsequently determined that the
    distribution was, in fact, in excess of our earnings and
    profits, and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign
    shareholder’s United States tax liability with respect to
    the distribution.

Any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock
    which is “regularly traded” on an established
    securities market, will be treated as an ordinary dividend
    described above, if the foreign shareholder did not own more
    than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the one year
    period ending on the date of the distribution. Foreign
    shareholders generally will not be required to report such
    distributions received from us on U.S. federal income tax
    returns and all distributions treated as



dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including
    any capital gain dividends, will be subject to a 30%
    U.S. withholding tax (unless reduced or eliminated under an
    applicable income tax treaty), as described above. In addition,
    the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such
    distributions.

Distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the
    time of the distributions as capital gain dividends, other than
    those arising from the disposition of a United States real
    property interest, generally will not be subject to United
    States federal income taxation unless:

(a)

the investment in the common shares is effectively connected
    with the foreign shareholder’s United States trade or
    business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject
    to the same treatment as domestic shareholders, except that a
    shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to
    the branch profits tax, as discussed above; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is
    present in the United States for 183 days or more during
    the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the United
    States, in which case the nonresident alien individual will be
    subject to a 30% tax on the individual’s capital gains.

Under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, which is
    known as FIRPTA, distributions to a foreign shareholder that are
    attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of United States
    real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be
    treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected
    with a United States trade or business. This rule applies
    whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain
    dividend. Accordingly, foreign shareholders generally would be
    taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to
    U.S. shareholders, subject to a special alternative minimum
    tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. In addition, a
    foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch
    profits tax discussed above, as well as U.S. federal income
    tax return filing requirements. We are required to withhold 35%
    of these distributions. The withheld amount can be credited
    against the foreign shareholder’s United States federal
    income tax liability.

Although the law is not entirely clear on the matter, it appears
    that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in
    respect of the common shares held by U.S. shareholders
    would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the
    same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends.
    Under that approach, foreign shareholders would be able to
    offset as a credit against their United States federal income
    tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on
    these undistributed capital gains. In addition, if timely
    requested, foreign shareholders might be able to receive from
    the IRS a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the
    tax paid by us were to exceed their actual United States federal
    income tax liability.

Foreign Shareholders’ Sales of Common
    Shares

. Gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon
    the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be
    subject to United States taxation unless the shares constitute a
    “United States real property interest” within the
    meaning of FIRPTA. The common shares will not constitute a
    United States real property interest so long as we are a
    domestically controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is
    a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing period
    less than 50% in value of its stock is held directly or
    indirectly by foreign shareholders. We believe that we are a
    domestically controlled REIT. Therefore, we believe that the
    sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under
    FIRPTA. However, because common shares and preferred shares are
    publicly traded, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be
    a domestically controlled REIT. In any event, gain from the sale
    or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to FIRPTA
    will be subject to U.S. tax, if either:

(a)

the investment in the common shares is effectively connected
    with the foreign shareholder’s United States trade or
    business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject
    to the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to
    the gain; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is
    present in the United States for 183 days or more during
    the taxable year and has a tax home in the United States, in
    which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a
    30% tax on the individual’s capital gains.

Even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically
    controlled REIT, gain arising from the sale or exchange by a
    foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject
    to United States taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a
    United States real property interest if:

(a)

the class or series of shares being sold is “regularly
    traded,” as defined by applicable IRS regulations, on an
    established securities market such as the New York Stock
    Exchange; and

(b)

the selling foreign shareholder owned 5% or less of the value of
    the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout
    the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange.



If gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to
    taxation under FIRPTA, the foreign shareholder would be subject
    to regular United States income tax with respect to the gain in
    the same manner as a taxable U.S. shareholder, subject to
    any applicable alternative minimum tax, a special alternative
    minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the
    possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of
    foreign corporations. The purchaser of the common shares would
    be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 10% of the purchase
    price.

Information
    Reporting Requirement and Backup Withholding

We will report to our domestic shareholders and the Internal
    Revenue Service the amount of distributions paid during each
    calendar year and the amount of tax withheld, if any. Under
    certain circumstances, domestic shareholders may be subject to
    backup withholding. Backup withholding will apply only if such
    domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us
    or the Internal Revenue Service. Backup withholding will not
    apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt
    recipients, such as corporations and tax-exempt organizations.
    Domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors
    regarding their qualification for exemption from backup
    withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption.
    Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount
    of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a
    domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such
    person’s United States federal income tax liability and may
    entitle such person to a refund, provided that the required
    information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

Medicare
    Tax on Unearned Income

Newly enacted legislation requires certain
    U.S. shareholders that are taxed as individuals, estates or
    trusts to pay an additional 3.8% tax on, among other things,
    dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other
    disposition of shares for taxable years beginning after
    December 31, 2012.

Withholding
    on Foreign Financial Institutions and

Non-U.S.

Shareholders

Newly enacted legislation may impose withholding taxes on
    certain types of payments made to “foreign financial
    institutions” and certain other

non-U.S. shareholders.

Under this legislation, the failure to comply with additional
    certification, information reporting and other specified
    requirements could result in withholding tax being imposed on
    payments of dividends and sales proceeds to
    U.S. shareholders that own their shares through foreign
    accounts or foreign intermediaries and certain

non-U.S. shareholders.

The legislation imposes a 30% withholding tax on dividends on,
    and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, our
    shares paid to a foreign financial institution or to a foreign
    non-financial entity, unless (i) the foreign financial
    institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting
    obligations or (ii) the foreign non-financial entity either
    certifies it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or
    furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial
    U.S. owner. In addition, if the payee is a foreign
    financial institution, it generally must enter into an agreement
    with the U.S. Treasury that requires, among other things,
    that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain
    U.S. persons or

U.S.-owned

foreign entities, annually report certain information about such
    accounts and withhold 30% on payments to certain other account
    holders. The legislation applies to payments made after
    December 31, 2012.

The Company’s properties had an average occupancy of
    approximately 94.1% (94.5% on a same store basis) at
    December 31, 2010. Certain of the Company’s properties
    are encumbered by mortgages and additional detail can be found
    on Schedule III – Real Estate and Accumulated
    Depreciation. Resident leases are generally for twelve months in
    length and can require security deposits. The garden-style
    properties are generally defined as properties with two

and/or

three
    story buildings while the mid-rise/high-rise are defined as
    properties with greater than three story buildings. These two
    property types typically provide residents with amenities, which
    may include a clubhouse, swimming pool, laundry facilities and
    cable television access. Certain of these properties offer
    additional amenities such as saunas, whirlpools, spas, sports
    courts and exercise rooms or other amenities. In addition, many
    of our urban properties have parking garage

and/or

retail components. The military housing properties are defined
    as those properties located on military bases.

The distribution of the properties throughout the United States
    reflects the Company’s belief that geographic
    diversification helps insulate the portfolio from regional and
    economic influences. At the same time, the Company has sought to
    create clusters of properties within each of its primary markets
    in order to achieve economies of scale in management and
    operation. The Company may nevertheless acquire additional
    multifamily properties located anywhere in the United States.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is party to a housing discrimination lawsuit brought
    by a non-profit civil rights organization in April 2006 in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The suit
    alleges that the Company designed and built approximately 300 of
    its properties in violation of the accessibility requirements of
    the Fair Housing Act and Americans With Disabilities Act. The
    suit seeks actual and punitive damages, injunctive relief
    (including modification of non-compliant properties), costs and
    attorneys’ fees. The Company believes it has a number of
    viable defenses, including that a majority of the named
    properties were completed before the operative dates of the
    statutes in question

and/or

were
    not designed or built by the Company. Accordingly, the Company
    is defending the suit vigorously. Due to the pendency of the
    Company’s defenses and the uncertainty of many other
    critical factual and legal issues, it is not possible to
    determine or predict the outcome of the suit or a possible loss
    or a range of loss, and no amounts have been accrued at
    December 31, 2010. While no assurances can be given, the
    Company does not believe that the suit, if adversely determined,
    would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company does not believe there is any other litigation
    pending or threatened against it that, individually or in the
    aggregate, may reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
    effect on the Company.

The number of record holders of Common Shares at
    February 16, 2011 was approximately 3,000. The number of
    outstanding Common Shares as of February 16, 2011 was
    293,981,029.

Unregistered
    Common Shares Issued in the Quarter Ended December 31,

During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    issued 262,151 Common Shares in exchange for 262,151
    OP Units held by various limited partners of the Operating
    Partnership. OP Units are generally exchangeable into
    Common Shares of EQR on a

one-for-one

basis or, at the option of the Operating Partnership, the cash
    equivalent thereof, at any time one year after the date of
    issuance. These shares were either registered under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
    Act”), or issued in reliance on an exemption from
    registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and
    the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as these were
    transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. In
    light of the manner of the sale and information obtained by the
    Company from the limited partners in connection with these
    transactions, the Company believes it may rely on these
    exemptions.

    that may be sold to employees and trustees under the ESPP.

The aggregate number of securities available for issuance
    (inclusive of restricted shares previously granted and
    outstanding and shares underlying outstanding options) under the
    2002 Plan equals 7.5% of the Company’s outstanding Common
    Shares, calculated on a fully diluted basis, determined annually
    on the first day of each calendar year. On January 1, 2011,
    this amount equaled 22,785,696, of which 5,395,739 shares
    were available for future issuance. No awards may be granted
    under the 2002 Plan after February 20, 2012.

The National Association of Real
    Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from
    operations (“FFO”) (April 2002 White Paper) as net
    income (computed in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)),
    excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property,
    plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be
    calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.
    The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of
    property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated
    operating properties only. Once the Company commences the
    conversion of apartment units to condominiums, it simultaneously
    discontinues depreciation of such property.



(2)

Normalized funds from operations
    (“Normalized FFO”) begins with FFO and
    excludes:

n

the impact of any expenses
    relating to asset impairment and valuation allowances;

n

property acquisition and other
    transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions and
    pursuit cost write-offs (other expenses);

n

gains and losses from early
    debt extinguishment, including prepayment penalties, preferred
    share redemptions and the cost related to the implied option
    value of non-cash convertible debt discounts;

n

gains and losses on the sales
    of non-operating assets, including gains and losses from land
    parcel and condominium sales, net of the effect of income tax
    benefits or expenses; and

n

other miscellaneous
    non-comparable items.

(3)

The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common
    Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental
    measures of the operating performance of a real estate company,
    because they are recognized measures of performance by the real
    estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to
    dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate
    depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in
    similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful
    life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and
    Units can help compare the operating performance of a
    company’s real estate between periods or as compared to
    different companies. The company also believes that Normalized
    FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are
    helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating
    performance of a real estate company because they allow
    investors to compare the company’s operating performance to
    its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating
    performance of other real estate companies without the effect of
    items that by their nature are not comparable from period to
    period and tend to obscure the Company’s actual operating
    results. FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units,
    Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and
    Units do not represent net income, net income available to
    Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in
    accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common
    Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to
    Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as
    alternatives to net income, net income available to Common
    Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined
    by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company’s
    calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units,
    Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and
    Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among
    other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for
    capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to
    such other real estate companies.

(4)

FFO available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO
    available to Common Shares and Units are calculated on a basis
    consistent with net income available to Common Shares and
    reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions
    and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities
    that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership
    in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the
    “Noncontrolling Interests – Operating
    Partnership”. Subject to certain restrictions, the
    Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership may
    exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a

one-for-one

basis.

Note: See Item 7 for a reconciliation of net income to FFO,
    FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and
    Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis of the results of
    operations and financial condition of the Company should be read
    in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
    Notes thereto. Due to the Company’s ability to control the
    Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, the Operating
    Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been
    consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes,
    except for an unconsolidated development land parcel and our
    military housing properties. Capitalized terms used herein and
    not defined are as defined elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

Forward-looking statements in this Item 7 as well as
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions
    of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
    statements are based on current expectations, estimates,
    projections and assumptions made by management. While the
    Company’s management believes the assumptions underlying
    its forward-looking statements are reasonable, such information
    is inherently subject to uncertainties and may involve certain
    risks, which could cause actual results, performance or
    achievements of the Company to



differ materially from anticipated future results, performance
    or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
    statements. Many of these uncertainties and risks are difficult
    to predict and beyond management’s control. Forward-looking
    statements are not guarantees of future performance, results or
    events. The forward-looking statements contained herein are made
    as of the date hereof and the Company undertakes no obligation
    to update or supplement these forward-looking statements.
    Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not
    limited to the following:

n

We intend to actively acquire

and/or

develop multifamily properties for rental operations as market
    conditions dictate. We may also acquire multifamily properties
    that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up. We may
    be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule,
    resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues

and/or

lower
    yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than
    expected concessions. We may underestimate the costs necessary
    to bring an acquired property up to standards established for
    its intended market position or to complete a development
    property. Additionally, we expect that other major real estate
    investors with significant capital will compete with us for
    attractive investment opportunities or may also develop
    properties in markets where we focus our development efforts.
    This competition (or lack thereof) may increase (or depress)
    prices for multifamily properties. We may not be in a position
    or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property
    acquisitions on favorable terms. The total number of development
    units, costs of development and estimated completion dates are
    subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic
    conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction
    materials), competition and local government regulation;

n

Debt financing and other capital
    required by the Company may not be available or may only be
    available on adverse terms;

n

Labor and materials required for
    maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or development may be
    more expensive than anticipated;

n

Occupancy levels and market rents
    may be adversely affected by national and local economic and
    market conditions including, without limitation, new
    construction and excess inventory of multifamily housing and
    single family housing, slow or negative employment growth,
    availability of low interest mortgages for single family home
    buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of
    which are beyond the Company’s control; and

n

Additional factors as discussed in
    Part I of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

particularly those under “Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

”.

Forward-looking statements and related uncertainties are also
    included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
    this report.

Overview

Equity Residential (“EQR”), a Maryland real estate
    investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993, is an
    S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition,
    development and management of high quality apartment properties
    in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be
    taxed as a REIT.

The Company is one of the largest publicly traded real estate
    companies and is the largest publicly traded owner of
    multifamily properties in the United States (based on the
    aggregate market value of its outstanding Common Shares, the
    number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues
    earned). The Company’s corporate headquarters are located
    in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also operates property
    management offices in each of its markets. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately
    4,000 employees who provided real estate operations,
    leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition,
    development and other support functions.

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2010
    owned an approximate 95.5% ownership interest in, ERP Operating
    Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the
    “Operating Partnership”). All of EQR’s property
    ownership, development and related business operations are
    conducted through the Operating Partnership and its
    subsidiaries. References to the “Company” include EQR,
    the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled
    by the Operating Partnership

and/or

EQR.

Business
    Objectives and Operating and Investing Strategies

The Company invests in apartment communities located in
    strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our
    risk adjusted total return (operating income plus capital
    appreciation) on invested capital.

Our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates
    to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to
    generate the highest possible return to our shareholders.
    Revenue is maximized by driving qualified



resident prospects to our properties, converting this traffic
    cost-effectively into new leases at the highest rent possible,
    keeping our residents satisfied and renewing their leases at yet
    higher rents. While we believe that it is our high-quality,
    well-located assets that bring our customers to us, it is our
    customer service that keeps them renting with us and
    recommending us to their friends.

We use technology to engage our customers in the way that they
    want to be engaged. Many of our residents utilize our web-based
    resident portal which allows them to review their account and
    make payments, provide feedback and make service requests
    on-line.

We seek to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by
    investing in markets that are characterized by conditions
    favorable to multifamily property appreciation. These markets
    generally feature one or more of the following:

n

High barriers to entry where,
    because of land scarcity or government regulation, it is
    difficult or costly to build new apartment properties leading to
    low supply;

n

High single family home prices
    making our apartments a more economical housing choice;

n

Strong economic growth leading to
    household formation and job growth, which in turn leads to high
    demand for our apartments; and

n

An attractive quality of life
    leading to high demand and retention and allowing us to more
    readily increase rents.

Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various
    sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow,
    issuance of additional equity and debt securities, sales of
    properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and
    uncollateralized borrowings. In addition, the Company may
    acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of
    limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership
    (“OP Units”) as consideration for the acquired
    properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances,
    enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the
    recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise
    result from the sales. EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold

and/or

sell
    based on market opportunities. The Company may also seek to
    acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt
    that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining
    title to property through foreclosure or

deed-in-lieu

of foreclosure proceedings. The Company has also, in the past,
    converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums
    but is not currently active in this line of business.

The Company primarily sources the funds for its new property
    acquisitions in its core markets with the sales proceeds from
    selling assets that are older or located in non-core markets.
    During the last five years, the Company has sold over 97,000
    apartment units for an aggregate sales price of
    $7.2 billion and acquired nearly 25,000 apartment units in
    its core markets for approximately $5.5 billion. We are
    currently acquiring and developing assets primarily in the
    following targeted metropolitan areas: Boston, New York,
    Washington DC, South Florida, Southern California,
    San Francisco, Seattle and to a lesser extent Denver. We
    also have investments (in the aggregate about 18% of our NOI) in
    other markets including Atlanta, Phoenix, Portland, Oregon, New
    England excluding Boston, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville but do
    not intend to acquire or develop assets in these markets.

As part of its strategy, the Company purchases completed and
    fully occupied apartment properties, partially completed or
    partially unoccupied properties or land on which apartment
    properties can be constructed. We intend to hold a diversified
    portfolio of assets across our target markets. Currently, no
    single metropolitan area accounts for more than 17% of our NOI,
    though no guarantee can be made that NOI concentration may not
    increase in the future.

We endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by
    providing them with the education, resources and opportunities
    to succeed. We provide many classroom and on-line training
    courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects
    and residents as well as extensively train our customer service
    specialists in maintaining the equipment and appliances on our
    property sites. We actively promote from within and many senior
    corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or
    junior positions. We monitor our employees’ engagement by
    surveying them annually and have consistently received high
    engagement scores.

We have a commitment to sustainability and consider the
    environmental impacts of our business activities. With its high
    density, multifamily housing is, by its nature, an
    environmentally friendly property type. Our recent acquisition
    and development activities have been primarily concentrated in
    pedestrian-friendly urban locations near public transportation.
    When developing and renovating our properties, we strive to
    reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving
    technology while positively impacting the experience of our
    residents and the value of our assets. We continue to implement
    a combination of irrigation, lighting and HVAC improvements at
    our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption.

Current
    Environment

Through much of 2009, the Company assumed a highly cautious
    outlook given uncertainty in the general economy and the capital
    markets and expected reduction in our property operations. In
    late 2009, the Company saw that occupancy was



firming. This was an especially encouraging sign as it came
    during the Company’s seasonally slower fourth quarter. At
    the same time, the Company also saw marked improvement in the
    capital markets. In response, the Company began acquiring assets
    and increasing rents for both new and renewing residents, which
    led to better operating and investment performance for the
    Company. 2010 was characterized by higher occupancy and rent
    levels than 2009. The Company increased rents to a greater
    extent in markets like the Northeast, where the economy was
    stronger and multifamily operating conditions were better. In
    2010, the Company ceased to hold the large cash balances (often
    $1.0 billion or more) that it held in 2009 in anticipation
    of debt maturities in an unsure capital markets climate. This
    had the result of increasing the Company’s earnings by
    decreasing debt prefunding costs. Finally, the Company was
    aggressive in acquiring $1.5 billion of assets in its
    target markets in 2010. Improvement materialized throughout 2010
    and as we enter 2011, we expect strong growth in same store
    revenue (anticipated increases ranging from 4.0% to 5.0%) and
    NOI (anticipated increases ranging from 5.0% to 7.5%) and are
    optimistic that the improvement realized in 2010 will be
    sustained for the foreseeable future.

We currently have access to multiple sources of capital
    including the equity markets as well as both the secured and
    unsecured debt markets. In July 2010, the Company completed a
    $600.0 million unsecured ten year notes offering with a
    coupon of 4.75% and an all-in effective interest rate of 5.09%.
    The all-in rate combined with its accretive nature compared to
    maturing 2011 fixed rate debt led the Company to pursue this
    transaction. The Company also raised $291.9 million in
    equity under its ATM Common Share offering program in 2010 and
    has raised an additional $154.5 million under this program
    thus far in 2011.

Given the strong market for many of our disposition assets and
    increased competition for assets in our target markets, we
    expect to be a net seller of assets in 2011 in contrast to being
    a net buyer of assets in 2010. The Company acquired 16
    consolidated properties consisting of 4,445 apartment units for
    $1.5 billion and six land parcels for $68.9 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2010. While competition
    for the properties we were interested in acquiring increased as
    2010 progressed due to the overall improvement in market
    fundamentals, we were able to close several, of what we believe
    are, long-term, value added acquisition opportunities. Our
    acquisition pipeline has moderated and we expect a greater
    concentration of our 2011 acquisitions to occur in the latter
    half of the year. We believe our access to capital, our ability
    to execute large, complex transactions and our ability to
    efficiently stabilize large scale lease up properties provide us
    with a competitive advantage. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Company sold 35 consolidated
    properties consisting of 7,171 apartment units for
    $718.4 million and 27 unconsolidated properties consisting
    of 6,275 apartment units generating cash proceeds to the Company
    of $26.9 million, as well as 2 condominium units for
    $0.4 million and one land parcel for $4.0 million. We
    expect to continue strategic dispositions and see an increase in
    dispositions in 2011 as we believe there is currently a robust
    market and favorable pricing for certain of our non-strategic
    assets. Our dispositions in 2010 were at higher capitalization
    (“cap”) rates (see definition in Results of
    Operations) than the acquisitions we completed. We expect this
    to continue in 2011 and expect to experience dilution from past
    and future transactions.

We believe that cash and cash equivalents, securities readily
    convertible to cash, current availability on our revolving
    credit facility and disposition proceeds for 2011 will provide
    sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to
    asset acquisitions, debt maturities and existing development
    projects through 2011. We expect that our remaining longer-term
    funding requirements will be met through some combination of new
    borrowings, equity issuances (including the Company’s ATM
    share offering program), property dispositions, joint ventures
    and cash generated from operations. There is significant
    uncertainty surrounding the futures of Fannie Mae and Freddie
    Mac. Any changes to their mandates could have a significant
    impact on the Company and may, among other things, lead to lower
    values for our disposition assets and higher interest rates on
    our borrowings. Such changes may also provide an advantage to us
    by making the cost of financing single family home ownership
    more expensive and provide us a competitive advantage given the
    size of our balance sheet and the multiple sources of capital to
    which we have access.

We believe that the Company is well-positioned as of
    December 31, 2010 (our properties are geographically
    diverse and were approximately 94.1% occupied (94.5% on a same
    store basis)), little new multifamily rental supply will be
    added to most of our markets over the next several years and the
    long-term demographic picture is positive. We believe our strong
    balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to fund our debt
    maturities and development fundings in the near term, and should
    also allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in
    the future. As economic conditions continue to improve, the
    short-term nature of our leases and the limited supply of new
    rental housing being constructed should allow us to realize
    revenue growth and improvement in our operating results.

The Company anticipates that 2011 same store expenses will only
    increase 1.0% to 2.0% primarily due to modest increases in
    payroll expenses, real estate tax rates and utility cost growth
    (same store expenses increased 0.9% for 2010 when compared with
    the same period in the prior year). This follows three
    consecutive years of excellent expense control (same store
    expenses declined 0.1% between 2009 and 2008 and grew 2.2%
    between 2008 and 2007 and 2.1% between 2007 and 2006).

The current environment information presented above is based on
    current expectations and is forward-looking.



Results
    of Operations

In conjunction with our business objectives and operating
    strategy, the Company continued to invest in apartment
    properties located in strategically targeted markets during the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
    In summary, we:

Year Ended December 31, 2010:

n

Acquired $1.1 billion of
    apartment properties consisting of 14 consolidated properties
    and 3,207 apartment units at a weighted average cap rate (see
    definition below) of 5.4% and six land parcels for
    $68.9 million, all of which we deem to be in our strategic
    targeted markets;

n

Acquired one unoccupied property
    in the second quarter of 2010 (425 Mass in
    Washington, D.C.) for $166.8 million consisting of 559
    apartment units that is expected to stabilize in its third year
    of ownership at an 8.5% yield on cost and one property in the
    third quarter of 2010 (Vantage Pointe in San Diego, CA) for
    $200.0 million consisting of 679 apartment units that was
    in the early stages of lease up and is expected to stabilize in
    its third year of ownership at a 7.0% yield on cost;

n

Acquired the 75% equity interest
    it did not own in seven previously unconsolidated properties
    consisting of 1,811 apartment units at an implied cap rate of
    8.4% in exchange for an approximate $30.0 million payment
    to its joint venture partner;

n

Sold $718.4 million of
    consolidated apartment properties consisting of 35 properties
    and 7,171 apartment units at a weighted average cap rate of
    6.7%, 2 condominium units for $0.4 million and one land
    parcel for $4.0 million, the majority of which was in exit
    or less desirable markets; and

n

Sold the last of its 25% equity
    interests in an institutional joint venture consisting of 27
    unconsolidated properties containing 6,275 apartment units.
    These properties were valued in their entirety at
    $417.8 million which results in an implied weighted average
    cap rate of 7.5% (generating cash to the Company, net of debt
    repayments, of $26.9 million).

Year Ended December 31, 2009:

n

Acquired $145.0 million of
    apartment properties consisting of two properties and 566
    apartment units (excluding the Company’s buyout of its
    partner’s interest in one previously unconsolidated
    property) and a long-term leasehold interest in a land parcel
    for $11.5 million, all of which we deem to be in our
    strategic targeted markets; and

n

Sold $1.0 billion of
    apartment properties consisting of 60 properties and 12,489
    apartment units (excluding the Company’s buyout of its
    partner’s interest in one previously unconsolidated
    property), as well as 62 condominium units for
    $12.0 million, the majority of which was in exit or less
    desirable markets.

The Company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each
    of its apartment communities is net operating income
    (“NOI”). NOI represents rental income less property
    and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense
    and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI
    is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its
    operating performance because it is a direct measure of the
    actual operating results of the Company’s apartment
    communities. The cap rate is generally the first year NOI yield
    (net of replacements) on the Company’s investment.

Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2010 and 2009
    (the “2010 Same Store Properties”), which represented
    112,042 apartment units, impacted the Company’s results of
    operations. Properties that the Company owned for all of both
    2009 and 2008 (the “2009 Same Store Properties”),
    which represented 113,598 apartment units, also impacted the
    Company’s results of operations. Both the 2010 Same Store
    Properties and 2009 Same Store Properties are discussed in the
    following paragraphs.

The Company’s acquisition, disposition and completed
    development activities also impacted overall results of
    operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
    Dilution, as a result of the Company’s net asset sales in
    2009, partially offset by net asset acquisitions and lease up
    activity in 2010, negatively impacts property net operating
    income. The impacts of these activities are discussed in greater
    detail in the following paragraphs.

Comparison
    of the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended
    December 31, 2009

For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported
    diluted earnings per share of $0.95 compared to $1.27 per share
    for the year ended December 31, 2009. The difference is
    primarily due to $37.3 million in lower gains from property
    sales in 2010 vs. 2009 and $34.3 million in higher
    impairment losses in 2010 vs. 2009.



For the year ended December 31, 2010, loss from continuing
    operations increased approximately $22.8 million when
    compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease
    in continuing operations is discussed below.

Revenues from the 2010 Same Store Properties decreased
    $2.1 million primarily as a result of a decrease in average
    rental rates charged to residents, partially offset by an
    increase in occupancy. Expenses from the 2010 Same Store
    Properties increased $6.2 million primarily due to
    increases in repairs and maintenance expenses (mostly due to
    greater storm-related costs such as snow removal and roof
    repairs incurred during the first quarter of 2010), higher
    property management costs and increases in utility costs,
    partially offset by lower real estate taxes and leasing and
    advertising expenses. The following tables provide comparative
    same store results and statistics for the 2010 Same Store
    Properties:

For properties that the Company acquired prior to

    December 31, 2011, the Company anticipates the following
    same store results for the full year ending December 31,

5.0% to 7.5%

The Company anticipates consolidated rental acquisitions of
    $1.0 billion and consolidated rental dispositions of
    $1.25 billion and expects that acquisitions will have a
    1.25% lower cap rate than dispositions for the full year ending
    December 31, 2011.

These 2011 assumptions are based on current expectations and are
    forward-looking.

Non-same store operating results increased approximately
    $84.6 million and consist primarily of properties acquired
    in calendar years 2009 and 2010, as well as operations from the
    Company’s completed development properties and corporate
    housing business. While the operations of the non-same store
    assets have been negatively impacted during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 similar to the same store assets, the
    non-same store assets have contributed a greater percentage of
    total NOI to the Company’s overall operating results
    primarily due to increasing occupancy for properties in

lease-up

and
    a longer ownership period in 2010 than 2009. This increase
    primarily resulted from:

n

Development and other
    miscellaneous properties in

lease-up

of
    $32.4 million;

n

Newly stabilized development and
    other miscellaneous properties of $0.2 million;

n

Properties acquired in 2009 and
    2010 of $56.2 million; and

n

Partially offset by an allocation
    of property management costs not included in same store results
    and operating activities from other miscellaneous operations,
    such as the Company’s corporate housing business.

See also Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional discussion regarding the
    Company’s segment disclosures.

Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset
    management expenses, increased approximately $1.5 million
    or 53.4% primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on
    management of the Company’s military housing ventures at
    Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base, as well as a
    decrease in asset management expenses, partially offset by the
    unwinding of the Company’s institutional joint ventures
    during 2010 (see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further discussion).

Property management expenses from continuing operations include
    off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the
    Company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any
    third party management companies. These expenses increased
    approximately $9.2 million or 12.8%. This increase is
    primarily attributable to an increase in payroll-related costs
    (due primarily to higher health insurance and bonus costs,
    acceleration of long-term compensation expense for retirement
    eligible employees and the creation of the Company’s
    central business group, which moved administrative functions
    off-site), legal and professional fees, education/conference
    expenses, real estate tax consulting fees and travel expenses.



Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes
    depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately
    $97.4 million or 17.4% primarily as a result of additional
    depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2009 and 2010,
    development properties placed in service and capital
    expenditures for all properties owned.

General and administrative expenses from continuing operations,
    which include corporate operating expenses, increased
    approximately $0.9 million or 2.3% primarily due to higher
    overall payroll-related costs (due primarily to higher bonus
    costs), partially offset by lower tax compliance fees and office
    rents. The Company anticipates that general and administrative
    expenses will approximate $40.0 million to
    $42.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2011.
    The above assumption is based on current expectations and is
    forward-looking.

Impairment from continuing operations increased approximately
    $34.3 million due to a $45.4 million impairment charge
    taken during the fourth quarter of 2010 on land held for
    development related to two potential development projects
    compared to an $11.1 million impairment charge taken during
    2009 on land held for development. See Note 20 in the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Interest and other income from continuing operations decreased
    approximately $11.1 million or 67.0% primarily as a result
    of a decrease in interest earned on cash and cash equivalents
    and investment securities due to lower interest rates during the
    year ended December 31, 2010 and lower overall balances as
    well as gains on debt extinguishment and the sale of investment
    securities recognized during the year ended December 31,
    2009 that did not reoccur in 2010, partially offset by an
    increase in insurance/litigation settlement proceeds. The
    Company anticipates that interest and other income will
    approximate $2.0 million to $3.0 million for the year
    ending December 31, 2011. The above assumption is based on
    current expectations and is forward-looking.

Other expenses from continuing operations increased
    approximately $5.4 million or 83.9% primarily due to an
    increase in the expensing of overhead (pursuit cost write-offs)
    as a result of the Company’s decision to reduce its
    development activities in prior periods as well as an increase
    in property acquisition costs incurred in conjunction with the
    Company’s significantly higher acquisition volume in 2010.

Interest expense from continuing operations, including
    amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased
    approximately $27.8 million or 5.5% primarily as a result
    of lower overall debt balances and higher debt extinguishment
    costs due to the significant debt repurchases in 2009 and lower
    rates in 2010, partially offset by interest expense on the
    $500.0 million mortgage pool that closed in 2009, the
    $600.0 million of unsecured notes that closed in July 2010
    and lower capitalized interest. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Company capitalized interest costs
    of approximately $13.0 million as compared to
    $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
    This capitalization of interest primarily relates to
    consolidated projects under development. The effective interest
    cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31,
    2010 was 5.14% as compared to 5.62% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. The Company anticipates that interest
    expense (excluding debt extinguishment costs and convertible
    debt discounts) will approximate $470.0 million to
    $480.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2011.
    The above assumption is based on current expectations and is
    forward-looking.

Income and other tax expense from continuing operations
    decreased approximately $2.5 million or 88.1% primarily due
    to a decrease in franchise taxes for Texas and a decrease in
    business taxes for Washington, D.C. The Company anticipates
    that income and other tax expense will approximate
    $0.5 million to $1.5 million for the year ending
    December 31, 2011. The above assumption is based on current
    expectations and is forward-looking.

Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased
    approximately $2.1 million or 73.9% as compared to the year
    ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the Company’s
    $1.8 million share of defeasance costs incurred in
    conjunction with the extinguishment of cross-collateralized
    mortgage debt on one of the Company’s partially owned
    unconsolidated joint ventures taken during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 that did not reoccur in 2010.

Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased
    approximately $17.4 million primarily due to larger gains
    on sale and revaluation of seven previously unconsolidated
    properties that were acquired from the Company’s joint
    venture partner and the gain on sale for 27 properties sold
    during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with
    unconsolidated properties sold in the same period in 2009.

Net loss on sales of land parcels increased approximately
    $1.4 million primarily due to the loss on sale of one land
    parcel during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Discontinued operations, net decreased approximately
    $63.3 million or 16.7% between the periods under
    comparison. This decrease is primarily due to lower gains from
    property sales during the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to the same period in 2009 and the operations of those
    properties. In addition, properties sold in 2010 reflect
    operations for none of or a



partial period in 2010 in contrast to a full or partial period
    in 2009. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion.

Comparison
    of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended
    December 31, 2008

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company reported
    diluted earnings per share of $1.27 compared to $1.46 per share
    for the year ended December 31, 2008. The difference is
    primarily due to the following:

n

$57.6 million in lower net
    gains on sales of discontinued operations in 2009 vs. 2008;

n

$84.0 million in lower
    property NOI in 2009 vs. 2008, primarily driven by
    $51.6 million in lower same store NOI and dilution from
    transaction activities, partially offset by higher NOI
    contributions from

lease-up

properties; and

n

Partially offset by
    $105.3 million in lower impairment losses in 2009 vs. 2008.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, income from
    continuing operations increased approximately $43.0 million
    when compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The
    increase in continuing operations is discussed below.

Revenues from the 2009 Same Store Properties decreased
    $52.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in
    average rental rates charged to residents and a decrease in
    occupancy. Expenses from the 2009 Same Store Properties
    decreased $0.8 million primarily due to lower property
    management costs, partially offset by higher real estate taxes
    and utility costs. The following tables provide comparative same
    store results and statistics for the 2009 Same Store Properties:

Non-same store operating results increased approximately
    $34.3 million or 79.4% and consist primarily of properties
    acquired in calendar years 2008 and 2009, as well as operations
    from the Company’s completed development properties and our
    corporate housing business. While the operations of the non-same
    store assets have been negatively impacted during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 similar to the same store assets, the
    non-same store assets have contributed a greater percentage of
    total NOI to the Company’s overall operating results
    primarily due to increasing occupancy for properties in

lease-up

and
    a longer ownership period in 2009 than 2008. This increase
    primarily resulted from:

n

Development and other
    miscellaneous properties in

lease-up

of
    $22.4 million;

n

Newly stabilized development and
    other miscellaneous properties of $1.6 million;

n

Properties acquired in 2008 and
    2009 of $11.9 million; and

n

Partially offset by operating
    activities from other miscellaneous operations.

See also Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional discussion regarding the
    Company’s segment disclosures.

Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset
    management expenses, increased approximately $0.1 million
    or 3.4% primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on
    management of the Company’s military housing ventures at
    Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base, as well as a
    decrease in asset management expenses. As of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, the Company managed 12,681 apartment units and
    14,485 apartment units, respectively, primarily for
    unconsolidated entities and its military housing ventures at
    Fort Lewis and McChord.

Property management expenses from continuing operations include
    off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the
    Company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any
    third party management companies. These expenses decreased
    approximately $5.1 million or 6.7%. This decrease is
    primarily attributable to lower overall payroll-related costs as
    a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the
    Company’s portfolio, as well as decreases in temporary
    help/contractors, telecommunications and travel expenses.

Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes
    depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately
    $23.0 million or 4.3% primarily as a result of additional
    depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2008 and 2009,
    development properties placed in service and capital
    expenditures for all properties owned.

General and administrative expenses from continuing operations,
    which include corporate operating expenses, decreased
    approximately $6.0 million or 13.3% primarily due to lower
    overall payroll-related costs as a result of a decrease in the
    number of properties in the Company’s portfolio, as well as
    a $2.9 million decrease in severance related costs in 2009
    and a decrease in tax consulting costs.

Impairment from continuing operations decreased approximately
    $105.3 million due to an $11.1 million impairment
    charge taken during 2009 on a land parcel held for development
    compared to a $116.4 million impairment charge taken in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 on land held for development related to
    five potential development projects that are no longer being
    pursued. See Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion.

Interest and other income from continuing operations decreased
    approximately $16.8 million or 50.3% primarily as a result
    of an $18.7 million gain recognized during 2008 related to
    the partial debt extinguishment of the Company’s notes
    compared to a $4.5 million gain recognized in 2009 (see
    Note 9). In addition, interest earned on cash and cash
    equivalents decreased due to a decrease in interest rates and
    because the Company received less insurance/litigation
    settlement proceeds and forfeited deposits in 2009, partially
    offset by a $4.9 million gain on the sale of investment
    securities realized in 2009.

Other expenses from continuing operations increased
    approximately $0.7 million or 12.6% primarily due to an
    increase in transaction costs incurred in conjunction with the
    Company’s acquisition of two properties consisting of 566
    apartment units from unaffiliated parties, as well as expensing
    transaction costs associated with the Company’s acquisition
    of all of its partners’ interests in five previously
    partially owned properties consisting of 1,587 apartment units
    in 2009.



Interest expense from continuing operations, including
    amortization of deferred financing costs, increased
    approximately $16.9 million or 3.4% primarily as a result
    of an increase in debt extinguishment costs and lower
    capitalized interest. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately
    $34.9 million as compared to $60.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. This capitalization of
    interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under
    development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for
    the year ended December 31, 2009 was 5.62% as compared to
    5.56% for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Income and other tax expense from continuing operations
    decreased approximately $2.5 million or 46.9% primarily due
    to a change in the estimate for Texas state taxes and lower
    overall state income taxes, partially offset by an increase in
    business taxes for Washington, D.C.

Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased
    approximately $2.7 million as compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2008 primarily due to the Company’s
    $1.8 million share of defeasance costs incurred in
    conjunction with the extinguishment of cross-collateralized
    mortgage debt on one of the Company’s partially owned
    unconsolidated joint ventures as well as a decline in the
    operating performance of these properties.

Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased
    approximately $7.8 million as the Company sold seven
    unconsolidated properties in 2009 (inclusive of the one property
    where the Company acquired its partners’ interest) compared
    to three unconsolidated properties in 2008.

Net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately
    $3.0 million due to the sale of vacant land located in
    Florida during the year ended December 31, 2008 versus no
    land sales in 2009.

Discontinued operations, net decreased approximately
    $97.4 million or 20.4% between the periods under
    comparison. This decrease is primarily due to lower gains from
    property sales during the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to the same period in 2008 and the operations of those
    properties. In addition, properties sold in 2009 reflect
    operations for a partial period in 2009 in contrast to a full
    period in 2008. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further discussion.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

For
    the Year Ended December 31, 2010

As of January 1, 2010, the Company had approximately
    $193.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, its restricted
    1031 exchange proceeds totaled $244.3 million and it had
    $1.37 billion available under its revolving credit facility
    (net of $56.7 million which was restricted/dedicated to
    support letters of credit and $75.0 million which had been
    committed by a now bankrupt financial institution and is not
    available for borrowing). After taking into effect the various
    transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net
    cash provided by operating activities, the Company’s cash
    and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2010 was
    approximately $431.4 million, its restricted 1031 exchange
    proceeds totaled $103.9 million and the amount available on
    the Company’s revolving credit facility was
    $1.28 billion (net of $147.3 million which was
    restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the
    $75.0 million discussed above).

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    generated proceeds from various transactions, which included the
    following:

n

Disposed of 35 consolidated
    properties, 27 unconsolidated properties, 2 condominium units
    and one land parcel, receiving net proceeds of approximately
    $699.6 million;

n

Obtained $173.6 million in
    new mortgage financing;

n

Issued $600.0 million of
    unsecured notes receiving net proceeds of $595.4 million
    before underwriting fees and other expenses; and

n

Issued approximately
    8.8 million Common Shares (including shares issued under
    the ATM program – see further discussion below) and
    received net proceeds of $406.2 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the above proceeds
    were primarily utilized to:

n

Acquire 16 rental properties
    and six land parcels for approximately $1.2 billion;

n

Acquire the 75% equity interest it
    did not own in seven previously unconsolidated properties
    consisting of 1,811 apartment units in exchange for an
    approximate $26.9 million payment to its joint venture
    partner (net of $3.1 million in cash acquired);

n

Invest $131.3 million
    primarily in development projects;



n

Repurchase 58,130 Common Shares,
    utilizing cash of $1.9 million (see Note 3);

n

Repay $652.1 million of
    mortgage loans; and

n

Settle a forward starting swap,
    utilizing cash of $10.0 million.

In September 2009, the Company announced the establishment of an

At-The-Market

(“ATM”) share offering program which would allow the
    Company to sell up to 17.0 million Common Shares from time
    to time over the next three years into the existing trading
    market at current market prices as well as through negotiated
    transactions. The Company may, but shall have no obligation to,
    sell Common Shares through the ATM share offering program in
    amounts and at times to be determined by the Company. Actual
    sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by
    the Company from time to time, including (among others) market
    conditions, the trading price of the Company’s Common
    Shares and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding
    for the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    the Company issued approximately 6.2 million Common Shares
    at an average price of $47.45 per share for total consideration
    of approximately $291.9 million through the ATM share
    offering program. During the year ended December 31, 2009,
    the Company issued approximately 3.5 million Common Shares
    at an average price of $35.38 per share for total consideration
    of approximately $123.7 million through the ATM share
    offering program. In addition, during the first quarter of 2011
    through January 13, 2011, the Company has issued
    approximately 3.0 million Common Shares at an average price
    of $50.84 per share for total consideration of approximately
    $154.5 million. The Company has not issued any shares under
    this program since January 13, 2011. Through
    February 16, 2011, the Company has cumulatively issued
    approximately 12.7 million Common Shares at an average
    price of $44.94 per share for total consideration of
    approximately $570.1 million. Including its recently filed
    prospectus supplement which added 5,687,478 Common Shares, the
    Company has 10.0 million Common Shares remaining available
    for issuance under the ATM program.

Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions
    and other opportunities for the investment of available capital,
    the Company may repurchase its Common Shares pursuant to its
    existing share repurchase program authorized by the Board of
    Trustees. The Company repurchased $1.9 million
    (58,130 shares at an average price per share of $32.46) of
    its Common Shares (all related to the vesting of employee
    restricted shares) during the year ended December 31, 2010.
    As of December 31, 2010, the Company had authorization to
    repurchase an additional $464.6 million of its shares. See
    Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further discussion.

Depending on its analysis of prevailing market conditions,
    liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other
    factors, the Company may from time to time seek to repurchase
    and retire its outstanding debt in open market or privately
    negotiated transactions.

An unlimited amount of equity and debt securities remains
    available for issuance by EQR and the Operating Partnership
    under effective shelf registration statements filed with the
    SEC. Most recently, EQR and the Operating Partnership filed a
    universal shelf registration statement for an unlimited amount
    of equity and debt securities that became automatically
    effective upon filing with the SEC in October 2010 (under SEC
    regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement
    automatically expires on October 14, 2013 and does not
    contain a maximum issuance amount). However, as of
    February 16, 2011, issuances under the ATM share offering
    program are limited to 10.0 million additional shares.



The Company’s “Consolidated

Debt-to-Total

Market Capitalization Ratio” as of December 31, 2010

On November 1, 2010, the Company redeemed its Series E
    and Series H Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares for
    cash consideration of $0.8 million and 355,539 Common
    Shares.

The Company generally expects to meet its short-term liquidity
    requirements, including capital expenditures related to
    maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled
    unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, through its working
    capital, net cash provided by operating activities and
    borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Under normal
    operating conditions, the Company considers its cash provided by
    operating activities to be adequate to meet operating
    requirements and payments of distributions. However, there may
    be times when the Company experiences shortfalls in its coverage
    of distributions, which may cause the Company to consider
    reducing its distributions

and/or

using
    the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing
    transactions to make up the difference. Should these shortfalls
    occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature, the
    Company’s financial condition may be adversely affected and
    it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels.
    The Company reduced its quarterly common share dividend
    beginning with the dividend for the third quarter of 2009, from
    $0.4825 per share to $0.3375 per share.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company announced a new
    dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts more
    closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the
    Company’s core business and provide transparency to
    investors. The Company intends to pay an annual cash dividend
    equal to approximately 65% of Normalized FFO. During the year
    ended December 31, 2010, the Company paid $0.3375 per share
    for each of the first three quarters and $0.4575 per share for
    the fourth quarter to bring the total payment for the year (an
    annual rate of $1.47 per share) to approximately 65% of
    Normalized FFO. The Company anticipates the expected dividend
    payout will be $1.56 to $1.62 per share ($0.3375 per share for
    each of the first three quarters with the balance for the fourth
    quarter) for the year ending December 31, 2011. The above
    assumption is based on current expectations and is
    forward-looking. While the new dividend policy makes it less
    likely that the Company will over distribute, it will also lead
    to a dividend reduction more quickly than in the past should
    operating results deteriorate. The Company believes that its
    expected 2011 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover
    capital expenditures and distributions.



The Company also expects to meet its long-term liquidity
    requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt
    maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and
    development activities and capital improvements through the
    issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities,
    including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from
    the disposition of certain properties as well as joint ventures.
    In addition, the Company has significant unencumbered properties
    available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event
    that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of
    alternative sources of capital is too high. The fair value of
    and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess
    of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply
    with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. Of
    the $19.7 billion in investment in real estate on the
    Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2010,
    $12.6 billion or 63.9%, was unencumbered. However, there
    can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be
    available to the Company in the future on acceptable terms or
    otherwise.

The Operating Partnership’s credit ratings from
    Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”),
    Moody’s and Fitch for its outstanding senior debt are BBB+,
    Baal and BBB+, respectively. The Company’s equity ratings
    from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch for its outstanding
    preferred equity are BBB+, Baa2 and BBB-, respectively. During
    the fourth quarter of 2010, Fitch downgraded the Operating
    Partnership’s credit rating from A- to BBB+ and the
    Company’s equity rating from BBB+ to BBB-, which does not
    have an effect on the Company’s cost of funds. During the
    first quarter of 2011, Moody’s raised its outlook for both
    the Company and the Operating Partnership from negative outlook
    to stable outlook.

The Operating Partnership has a $1.425 billion (net of
    $75.0 million which had been committed by a now bankrupt
    financial institution and is not available for borrowing)
    long-term revolving credit facility with available borrowings as
    of February 16, 2011 of $1.34 billion (net of
    $83.8 million which was restricted/dedicated to support
    letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed
    above) that matures in February 2012 (See Note 10 in the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    discussion). This facility may, among other potential uses, be
    used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties
    under development and short-term liquidity requirements.

On July 16, 2010, a portion of the parking garage collapsed
    at one of the Company’s rental properties (Prospect Towers
    in Hackensack, New Jersey). The Company estimates that the costs
    related to such collapse (both expensed and capitalized),
    including providing for residents’ interim needs, lost
    revenue and garage reconstruction, will be approximately
    $12.0 million, after insurance reimbursements of
    $8.0 million. Costs to rebuild the garage will be
    capitalized as incurred. Other costs, like those to accommodate
    displaced residents, lost revenue due to a portion of the
    property being temporarily unavailable for occupancy and legal
    costs, will reduce earnings as they are incurred. Generally,
    insurance proceeds will be recorded as increases to earnings as
    they are received. An impairment charge of $1.3 million was
    recognized to write-off the net book value of the collapsed
    garage. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the
    Company received approximately $4.0 million in insurance
    proceeds which fully offset the impairment charge and partially
    offset expenses of $5.5 million that were recorded relating
    to this loss and are included in real estate taxes and insurance
    on the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the
    Company estimates that its lost revenues approximated
    $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2010
    as a result of the high-rise tower being unoccupied following
    the garage collapse.

See Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for discussion of the events which occurred
    subsequent to December 31, 2010.

Capitalization
    of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate

Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to
    capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property
    or extend the useful life of the component asset of the
    property. We track improvements to real estate in two major
    categories and several subcategories:

n

Replacements

(inside the
    unit)

. These include:

n

flooring such as carpets,
    hardwood, vinyl, linoleum or tile;

n

appliances;

n

mechanical equipment such as
    individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc;

n

furniture and fixtures such as
    kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks,
    tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc; and

n

blinds/shades.

All replacements are depreciated over a five-year estimated
    useful life. We expense as incurred all make-ready maintenance
    and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of
    individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement
    item noted above.

n

Building improvements

(outside
    the unit)

. These include:

n

roof replacement and major repairs;



n

paving or major resurfacing of
    parking lots, curbs and sidewalks;

n

amenities and common areas such as
    pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies,
    clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and
    offices;

n

major building mechanical
    equipment systems;

n

interior and exterior structural
    repair and exterior painting and siding;

n

major landscaping and grounds
    improvement; and

n

vehicles and office and
    maintenance equipment.

All building improvements are depreciated over a five to
    ten-year estimated useful life. We capitalize building
    improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds
    $2,500 (selected projects must exceed $10,000);
    (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and
    (iii) improves the value of the asset.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, our actual
    improvements to real estate totaled approximately
    $138.2 million. This includes the following (amounts in
    thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit
    amounts):

For 2011, the Company estimates that it will spend approximately
    $1,200 per apartment unit of capital expenditures for its same
    store properties inclusive of unit renovation/rehab costs, or
    $850 per apartment unit excluding unit renovation/rehab costs.
    For 2011, the Company estimates that it will spend
    $41.0 million rehabbing 5,500 apartment units (equating to
    about $7,500 per apartment unit rehabbed). The above assumptions
    are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company’s
    total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer
    software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and
    leasehold improvements to the Company’s property management
    offices and its corporate offices, were approximately
    $3.0 million. The Company expects to fund approximately
    $8.5 million in total additions to non-real estate property
    in 2011. The above assumption is based on current expectations
    and is forward-looking.

Improvements to real estate and additions to non-real estate
    property are generally funded from net cash provided by
    operating activities and from investment cash flow.

Derivative
    Instruments

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the
    effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to manage
    these risks by following established risk management policies
    and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge
    interest rate risk on debt instruments.

The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with
    major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and
    other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying
    and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to
    hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from these
    instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect
    on its net income or financial position in the future from the
    use of derivatives it currently has in place.

See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments
    at December 31, 2010.

Other

Total distributions paid in January 2011 amounted to
    $141.3 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned
    Properties), which included certain distributions declared
    during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

The Company had co-invested in various properties that were
    unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting. Management does not believe these investments had a
    materially different impact upon the Company’s liquidity,
    cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than its
    other property management and ownership activities. During 2000
    and 2001, the Company entered into institutional ventures with
    an unaffiliated partner. At the respective closing dates, the
    Company sold

and/or

contributed 45 properties containing 10,846 apartment units to
    these ventures and retained a 25% ownership interest in the
    ventures. The Company’s joint venture partner contributed
    cash equal to 75% of the

agreed-upon

equity value of the properties comprising the ventures, which
    was then distributed to the Company. The Company’s strategy
    with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration
    of properties in a variety of markets. As of December 31,
    2010, the Company had sold its interest in these unconsolidated
    ventures with the exception of eight properties consisting of
    2,061 apartment units which were acquired by the Company. All of
    the related debt encumbering these ventures was extinguished.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company has four projects
    totaling 717 apartment units in various stages of development
    with estimated completion dates ranging through
    September 30, 2012, as well as other completed development
    projects that are in various stages of lease up or are
    stabilized. The development agreements currently in place are
    discussed in detail in Note 18 of the Company’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

See also Notes 2 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the
    Company’s investments in partially owned entities.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to use judgment in the application of
    accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.
    If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances
    relating to various transactions had been different or different
    assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting
    policies would have been applied, resulting in different
    financial results or different presentation of our financial
    statements.

The Company’s significant accounting policies are described
    in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements. These policies were followed in preparing the
    consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 and are consistent with the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

The Company has identified five significant accounting policies
    as critical accounting policies. These critical accounting
    policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of
    our financial condition and those requiring significant
    judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical
    accounting policies, management believes that the application of
    judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces
    financial information that fairly presents the results of
    operations for all periods presented. The five critical
    accounting policies are:

Acquisition
    of Investment Properties

The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to net
    tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on
    their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for
    purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a
    number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be
    obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the
    respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and
    existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market
    data. The Company also considers information obtained about each
    property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence,
    marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of
    the tangible and intangible assets acquired.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets,
    including its investments in real estate, for indicators of
    impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment
    indicators are based on factors such as operational performance,
    market conditions and legal and environmental concerns, as well
    as the Company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard
    to each asset. Future events could occur which would cause the
    Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an
    impairment loss is warranted.



Depreciation
    of Investment in Real Estate

The Company depreciates the building component of its investment
    in real estate over a

30-year

estimated useful life, building improvements over a

5-year

to

10-year

estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and
    equipment and replacements components over a

5-year

estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental
    determinations.

Cost
    Capitalization

See the

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to
    Real Estate

section for a discussion of the Company’s
    policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed
    asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company
    capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of
    employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their
    time on the supervision of major capital

and/or

renovation projects. These costs are reflected on the balance
    sheet as an increase to depreciable property.

For all development projects, the Company uses its professional
    judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for
    capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company
    capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and
    payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly
    responsible for and who spend all of their time on development
    activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than
    90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
    These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as

construction-in-progress

for each specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all
    payroll costs of

on-site

employees working directly at our properties, except as noted
    above on our development properties prior to certificate of
    occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected
    properties when additional incremental employees are hired.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative
    Instruments

The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to
    make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
    instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values
    of its financial instruments, including its derivative
    instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes.
    Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates
    on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on
    other factors relevant to the financial instruments.

Funds
    From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations

For the year ended December 31, 2010, Funds From Operations
    (“FFO”) available to Common Shares and Units and
    Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units increased
    $7.3 million, or 1.2%, and $20.9 million, or 3.2%,
    respectively, as compared to the year ended December 31,
    2009. For the year ended December 31, 2009, FFO available
    to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO available to
    Common Shares and Units decreased $2.9 million, or 0.5%,
    and $73.5 million, or 10.0%, respectively, as compared to
    the year ended December 31, 2008.

The National Association of Real
    Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from
    operations (“FFO”) (April 2002 White Paper) as net
    income (computed in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)),
    excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property,
    plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be
    calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.
    The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of
    property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated
    operating properties only. Once the Company commences the
    conversion of apartment units to condominiums, it simultaneously
    discontinues depreciation of such property.

(2)

Normalized funds from operations
    (“Normalized FFO”) begins with FFO and
    excludes:

n

the impact of any expenses
    relating to asset impairment and valuation allowances;

n

property acquisition and other
    transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions and
    pursuit cost write-offs (other expenses);

n

gains and losses from early
    debt extinguishment, including prepayment penalties, preferred
    share redemptions and the cost related to the implied option
    value of non-cash convertible debt discounts;



n

gains and losses on the sales
    of non-operating assets, including gains and losses from land
    parcel and condominium sales, net of the effect of income tax
    benefits or expenses; and

n

other miscellaneous
    non-comparable items.

(3)

The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common
    Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental
    measures of the operating performance of a real estate company,
    because they are recognized measures of performance by the real
    estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to
    dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate
    depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in
    similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful
    life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and
    Units can help compare the operating performance of a
    company’s real estate between periods or as compared to
    different companies. The company also believes that Normalized
    FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are
    helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating
    performance of a real estate company because they allow
    investors to compare the company’s operating performance to
    its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating
    performance of other real estate companies without the effect of
    items that by their nature are not comparable from period to
    period and tend to obscure the Company’s actual operating
    results. FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units,
    Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and
    Units do not represent net income, net income available to
    Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in
    accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common
    Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to
    Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as
    alternatives to net income, net income available to Common
    Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined
    by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company’s
    calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units,
    Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and
    Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among
    other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for
    capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to
    such other real estate companies.

(4)

FFO available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO
    available to Common Shares and Units are calculated on a basis
    consistent with net income available to Common Shares and
    reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions
    and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities
    that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership
    in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the
    “Noncontrolling Interests – Operating
    Partnership”. Subject to certain restrictions, the
    Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership may
    exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a

one-for-one

basis.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risks relating to the Company’s financial
    instruments result primarily from changes in short-term LIBOR
    interest rates and changes in the SIFMA index for tax-exempt
    debt. The Company does not have any direct foreign exchange or
    other significant market risk.

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in
    interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and
    term credit facilities as well as floating rate tax-exempt debt.
    The Company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to
    finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate
    debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a
    temporary measure in advance of securing long-term fixed rate
    financing. The Company continuously evaluates its level of
    floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors,
    including its assessment of the current and future economic
    environment. To the extent the Company carries substantial cash
    balances, this will tend to partially counterbalance any
    increase or decrease in interest rates.

The Company also utilizes certain derivative financial
    instruments to manage market risk. Interest rate protection
    agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed
    rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates
    on future debt issuances. Derivatives are used for hedging
    purposes rather than speculation. The Company does not enter
    into financial instruments for trading purposes. See also
    Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional discussion of derivative instruments.

The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments
    (including such items in the financial statement captions as
    cash and cash equivalents, other assets, lines of credit,
    accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities)
    approximate their carrying or contract values based on their
    nature, terms and interest rates that approximate current market
    rates. The fair value of the Company’s mortgage notes
    payable and unsecured notes were approximately $4.7 billion
    and $5.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had total outstanding
    floating rate debt of approximately $1.7 billion, or 17.5%
    of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments.
    If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt
    permanently increased by 14 basis points (a 10% increase
    from the Company’s existing weighted average interest
    rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate
    debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by
    approximately $2.4 million. If market rates of interest on
    all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by
    14 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s
    existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in
    interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future
    earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.4 million.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had total outstanding
    fixed rate debt of approximately $8.2 billion, or 82.5% of
    total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If
    market rates of interest permanently increased by 57 basis
    points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted
    average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the
    Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately
    $7.5 billion. If market rates of interest permanently
    decreased by 57 basis points (a 10% decrease from the
    Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the
    estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt would
    be approximately $9.1 billion.

At December 31, 2010, the Company’s derivative
    instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately
    $23.3 million. If market rates of interest permanently
    increased by 12 basis points (a 10% increase from the
    Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the
    net liability fair value of the Company’s derivative
    instruments would be approximately $9.8 million. If market
    rates of interest permanently decreased by 12 basis points
    (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted
    average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the
    Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately
    $37.0 million.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had total outstanding
    floating rate debt of approximately $1.8 billion, or 19.7%
    of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments.
    If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt
    permanently increased by 13 basis points (a 10% increase
    from the Company’s existing weighted average interest
    rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate
    debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by
    approximately $2.4 million. If market rates of interest on
    all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by
    13 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s
    existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in
    interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future
    earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.4 million.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had total outstanding
    fixed rate debt of approximately $7.5 billion, or 80.3% of
    total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If
    market rates of interest permanently increased by 59 basis
    points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted
    average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the
    Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately
    $6.9 billion. If market rates of interest permanently
    decreased by 59 basis points (a 10% decrease from the
    Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the
    estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt would
    be approximately $8.4 billion.



At December 31, 2009, the Company’s derivative
    instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately
    $25.2 million. If market rates of interest permanently
    increased by 20 basis points (a 10% increase from the
    Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the
    net asset fair value of the Company’s derivative
    instruments would be approximately $35.5 million. If market
    rates of interest permanently decreased by 20 basis points
    (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted
    average interest rates), the net asset fair value of the
    Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately
    $15.9 million.

These amounts were determined by considering the impact of
    hypothetical interest rates on the Company’s financial
    instruments. The foregoing assumptions apply to the entire
    amount of the Company’s debt and derivative instruments and
    do not differentiate among maturities. These analyses do not
    consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity
    that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event
    of changes of such magnitude, management would likely take
    actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes.
    However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that
    would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes
    no changes in the Company’s financial structure or results.

The Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in
    interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and,
    therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any
    assurance that long-term debt will be available at advantageous
    pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from
    the estimated adverse changes discussed above.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures:

Effective as of December 31, 2010, the Company carried out
    an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
    of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
    Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15

and

15d-15.

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by the Company in its Exchange Act filings is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

(b)  Management’s Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting:

Equity Residential’s management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of management, including the Company’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
    Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation.

Based on the Company’s evaluation under the framework in
    Internal Control – Integrated Framework, management
    concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2010. Our internal control
    over financial reporting has been audited as of
    December 31, 2010 by Ernst & Young LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report which is included herein.

(c)  Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting:

There were no changes to the internal control over financial
    reporting of the Company identified in connection with the
    Company’s evaluation referred to above that occurred during
    the fourth quarter of 2010 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Equity Residential (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, changes in equity and cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
    listed in the accompanying index to the consolidated financial
    statements and schedule. These financial statements and schedule
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
    consolidated financial position of Equity Residential at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Equity Residential’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2011
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential

We have audited Equity Residential’s (the
    “Company”) internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the “COSO Criteria”). Equity Residential’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Equity Residential maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO Criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Equity Residential as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, changes in equity and cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2010 of Equity Residential and our report dated
    February 24, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

EQUITY
    RESIDENTIAL

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS

1.

Business

Equity Residential (“EQR”), a Maryland real estate
    investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993, is an
    S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition,
    development and management of high quality apartment properties
    in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be taxed
    as a REIT.

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2010
    owned an approximate 95.5% ownership interest in, ERP Operating
    Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the
    “Operating Partnership”). The Company is structured as
    an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”) under which
    all property ownership and related business operations are
    conducted through the Operating Partnership and its
    subsidiaries. References to the “Company” include EQR,
    the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled
    by the Operating Partnership

and/or

EQR.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company, directly or
    indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned
    all or a portion of 451 properties located in 17 states and
    the District of Columbia consisting of 129,604 apartment units.
    The ownership breakdown includes (table does not include various
    uncompleted development properties):

Apartment

Properties

Units

Wholly Owned Properties


119,634

Partially Owned Properties – Consolidated


5,232

Military Housing


4,738


129,604

The “Wholly Owned Properties” are accounted for under
    the consolidation method of accounting. The Company beneficially
    owns 100% fee simple title to 422 of the 425 Wholly Owned
    Properties and all but one of its wholly owned development
    properties and land parcels. The Company owns the building and
    improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements
    under long-term ground leases that expire in 2026, 2077 and 2101
    for the three operating properties, respectively, and 2104 for
    one land parcel. These properties are consolidated and reflected
    as real estate assets while the ground leases are accounted for
    as operating leases.

The “Partially Owned Properties –
    Consolidated” are controlled by the Company but have
    partners with noncontrolling interests and are accounted for
    under the consolidation method of accounting. The “Military
    Housing” properties consist of investments in limited
    liability companies that, as a result of the terms of the
    operating agreements, are accounted for as management contract
    rights with all fees recognized as fee and asset management
    revenue.

2.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of
    Presentation

Due to the Company’s ability as general partner to control
    either through ownership or by contract the Operating
    Partnership and its subsidiaries, the Operating Partnership and
    each such subsidiary has been consolidated with the Company for
    financial reporting purposes, except for an unconsolidated
    development land parcel and our military housing properties. The
    consolidated financial statements also include all variable
    interest entities for which the Company is the primary
    beneficiary.

Real
    Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real
    Estate

Effective for business combinations on or after January 1,
    2009, an acquiring entity is required to recognize all assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the
    acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. In
    addition, an acquiring entity is required to expense
    acquisition-related costs as incurred (amounts are included in
    the other expenses line item in the consolidated statements of
    operations), value noncontrolling interests at fair value at the
    acquisition date and expense restructuring costs associated with
    an acquired business.

The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to net
    tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on
    their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for
    purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a
    number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be
    obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the
    respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and
    existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market
    data. The Company also considers information obtained about each
    property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence,
    marketing and

F-12


leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible
    and intangible assets acquired. The Company allocates the
    purchase price of acquired real estate to various components as
    follows:

n

Land – Based on actual
    purchase price if acquired separately or market
    research/comparables if acquired with an operating property.

n

Furniture, Fixtures and
    Equipment – Ranges between $8,000 and $13,000 per
    apartment unit acquired as an estimate of the fair value of the
    appliances and fixtures inside an apartment unit. The
    per-apartment unit amount applied depends on the type of
    apartment building acquired. Depreciation is calculated on the
    straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five years.

n

In-Place Leases – The
    Company considers the value of acquired in-place leases and the
    amortization period is the average remaining term of each
    respective in-place acquired lease.

n

Other Intangible
    Assets – The Company considers whether it has acquired
    other intangible assets, including any customer relationship
    intangibles and the amortization period is the estimated useful
    life of the acquired intangible asset.

n

Building – Based on the
    fair value determined on an “as-if vacant” basis.
    Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over an
    estimated useful life of thirty years.

Replacements inside an apartment unit such as appliances and
    carpeting are depreciated over a five-year estimated useful
    life. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are
    expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations
    and improvements that improve

and/or

extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their
    estimated useful life, generally five to ten years. Initial
    direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense
    approximates the deferral and amortization of initial direct
    leasing costs over the lease terms. Property sales or
    dispositions are recorded when title transfers to unrelated
    third parties, contingencies have been removed and sufficient
    cash consideration has been received by the Company. Upon
    disposition, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are
    removed from the respective accounts. Any gain or loss on sale
    is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States.

The Company classifies real estate assets as real estate held
    for disposition when it is certain a property will be disposed
    of (see further discussion below).

The Company classifies properties under development

and/or

expansion and properties in the

lease-up

phase (including land) as

construction-in-progress

until construction has been completed and all certificates of
    occupancy permits have been obtained.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets,
    including its investments in real estate, for indicators of
    impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment
    indicators are based on factors such as operational performance,
    market conditions and legal and environmental concerns, as well
    as the Company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard
    to each asset. Future events could occur which would cause the
    Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an
    impairment loss is warranted.

For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company compares
    the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long-lived
    asset against the carrying amount of that asset. If the sum of
    the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying
    amount of the asset, the Company would record an impairment loss
    for the difference between the estimated fair value and the
    carrying amount of the asset.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, an impairment loss is
    recognized when the estimated fair value of the asset, less the
    estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the
    asset measured at the time that the Company has determined it
    will sell the asset. Long-lived assets held for disposition and
    the related liabilities are separately reported, with the
    long-lived assets reported at the lower of their carrying
    amounts or their estimated fair values, less their costs to
    sell, and are not depreciated after reclassification to real
    estate held for disposition.

Cost
    Capitalization

See the

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in
    Real Estate

section for a discussion of the Company’s
    policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed
    asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company
    capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of
    employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their
    time on the

F-13


supervision of major capital

and/or

renovation projects. These costs are reflected on the balance
    sheet as an increase to depreciable property.

For all development projects, the Company uses its professional
    judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for
    capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company
    capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and
    payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly
    responsible for and who spend all of their time on development
    activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than
    90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
    These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as

construction-in-progress

for each specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all
    payroll costs of

on-site

employees working directly at our properties, except as noted
    above on our development properties prior to certificate of
    occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected
    properties when additional incremental employees are hired.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all demand deposits, money market accounts
    and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase
    agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less at
    the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company
    maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial
    institutions. The combined account balances at one or more
    institutions typically exceed the Federal Depository Insurance
    Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance coverage, and, as a
    result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to
    amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. The
    Company believes that the risk is not significant, as the
    Company does not anticipate the financial institutions’
    non-performance.

Investment
    Securities

Investment securities are included in other assets in the
    consolidated balance sheets. These securities are classified as

held-to-maturity

and carried at amortized cost if management has the positive
    intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
    Otherwise, the securities are classified as

available-for-sale

and carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and
    losses included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss)
    income, a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

Deferred
    Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to
    obtain the Company’s lines of credit and long-term
    financings. These costs are amortized over the terms of the
    related debt. Unamortized financing costs are written off when
    debt is retired before the maturity date. The accumulated
    amortization of such deferred financing costs was
    $43.9 million and $34.6 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative
    Instruments

The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to
    make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
    instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values
    of its financial instruments, including its derivative
    instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes.
    Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates
    on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on
    other factors relevant to the financial instruments.

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the
    effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to manage
    these risks by following established risk management policies
    and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge
    interest rate risk on debt instruments.

The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with
    major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and
    other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying
    and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to
    hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from these
    instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect
    on its net income or financial position in the future from the
    use of derivatives.

The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measures
    those instruments at fair value. In addition, fair value
    adjustments will affect either shareholders’ equity or net
    income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify
    as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the
    hedging activity. When the terms of an underlying transaction
    are modified, or when the underlying transaction is terminated
    or completed, all changes in the fair value of the instrument
    are

marked-to-market

with changes in value included in net income each period until
    the instrument matures. Any derivative instrument used for risk
    management that does not meet the hedging criteria is

marked-to-market

each period. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or
    speculative purposes.

F-14


Revenue
    Recognition

Rental income attributable to residential leases is recorded on
    a straight-line basis, which is not materially different than if
    it were recorded when due from residents and recognized monthly
    as it was earned. Leases entered into between a resident and a
    property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally

year-to-year,

renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly
    basis. Fee and asset management revenue and interest income are
    recorded on an accrual basis.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company expenses share-based compensation such as restricted
    shares and share options. The fair value of the option grants
    are recognized over the vesting period of the options. The fair
    value for the Company’s share options was estimated at the
    time the share options were granted using the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model with the following weighted average
    assumptions:




Expected volatility (1)

32.4%

20.3%

Expected life (2)

Risk-free interest rate (4)

2.29%

1.89%

2.67%

Option valuation per share

$6.18

$3.38

$4.08

The valuation method and assumptions are the same as those the
    Company used in accounting for option expense in its
    consolidated financial statements. The Black-Scholes option
    valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair
    value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and
    are fully transferable. This model is only one method of valuing
    options and the Company’s use of this model should not be
    interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy. Because the
    Company’s share options have characteristics significantly
    different from those of traded options, and because changes in
    the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair
    value estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing
    models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of
    the fair value of its share options and the actual value of the
    options may be significantly different.

Income
    and Other Taxes

Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT and the nature of
    the operations of its operating properties, no provision for
    federal income taxes has been made at the EQR level.
    Historically, the Company has generally only incurred certain
    state and local income, excise and franchise taxes. The Company
    has elected Taxable REIT Subsidiary (“TRS”) status for
    certain of its corporate subsidiaries, primarily those entities
    engaged in condominium conversion and corporate housing
    activities and as a result, these entities will incur both
    federal and state income taxes on any taxable income of such
    entities after consideration of any net operating losses.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future
    tax consequences attributable to differences between the
    financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases. These assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates for which the
    temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
    The effects of changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized in earnings in the period enacted.
    The Company’s deferred tax assets are generally the result
    of tax affected amortization of goodwill, differing depreciable
    lives on capitalized assets and the timing of expense
    recognition for certain accrued liabilities. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company has recorded a deferred tax
    asset of approximately $38.7 million, which is fully offset
    by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty in forecasting
    future TRS taxable income.

The Company provided for income, franchise and excise taxes

    year, as well as the NOLs generated in 2009 and 2010, are
    available for carryforward to future tax years. The
    Company’s TRSs have approximately $59.3 million of NOL
    carryforwards available as of January 1, 2011 that will
    expire in 2028, 2029 and 2030.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,

    December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately
    $11.1 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively.

Noncontrolling
    Interests

A noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (minority interest) is
    in most cases an ownership interest in the consolidated entity
    that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial
    statements and separate from the parent company’s equity.
    In addition, consolidated net income is required to be reported
    at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the
    parent and the noncontrolling interest and the amount of
    consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the
    noncontrolling interest are required to be disclosed on the face
    of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 3
    for further discussion.

Operating Partnership: Net income is allocated to noncontrolling
    interests based on their respective ownership percentage of the
    Operating Partnership. The ownership percentage is calculated by
    dividing the number of units of limited partnership interest
    (“OP Units”) held by the noncontrolling interests
    by the total OP Units held by the noncontrolling interests
    and EQR. Issuance of additional common shares of beneficial
    interest, $0.01 par value per share (the “Common
    Shares”), and OP Units changes the ownership interests
    of both the noncontrolling interests and EQR. Such transactions
    and the related proceeds are treated as capital transactions.

Partially Owned Properties: The Company reflects noncontrolling
    interests in partially owned properties on the balance sheet for
    the portion of properties consolidated by the Company that are
    not wholly owned by the Company. The earnings or losses from
    those properties attributable to the noncontrolling interests
    are reflected as noncontrolling interests in partially owned
    properties in the consolidated statements of operations.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating
    Partnership: The Company classifies Redeemable Noncontrolling
    Interests – Operating Partnership in the mezzanine
    section of the consolidated balance sheets for the portion of
    OP Units that the Company is required, either by contract
    or securities law, to deliver registered EQR Common Shares to
    the exchanging OP Unit

F-16


holder. The redeemable noncontrolling interest units are
    adjusted to the greater of carrying value or fair market value
    based on the Common Share price of EQR at the end of each
    respective reporting period.

Use of
    Estimates

In preparation of the Company’s financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States, management makes estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications considered necessary for a fair
    presentation have been made to the prior period financial
    statements in order to conform to the current year presentation.
    These reclassifications have not changed the results of
    operations or equity.

Other

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued

The FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles

, which superseded all then-existing non-SEC
    accounting and reporting standards and became the source of
    authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental
    entities. The Company adopted the codification as required,
    effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. The
    adoption of the codification has no impact on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations or financial position but
    changed the way we refer to accounting literature in our reports.

Effective January 1, 2010, in an effort to improve
    financial standards for transfers of financial assets, more
    stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a
    financial asset as a sale (e.g. loan participations) are
    required, the concept of a “qualifying special-purpose
    entity” and special guidance for guaranteed mortgage
    securitizations are eliminated, other sale-accounting criteria
    is clarified and the initial measurement of a transferor’s
    interest in transferred financial assets is changed. This does
    not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations or financial position.

Effective January 1, 2010, the analysis for identifying the
    primary beneficiary of a Variable Interest Entity
    (“VIE”) has been simplified by replacing the previous
    quantitative-based analysis with a framework that is based more
    on qualitative judgments. The analysis requires the primary
    beneficiary of a VIE to be identified as the party that both
    (a) has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that
    most significantly impact its economic performance and
    (b) has an obligation to absorb losses or a right to
    receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the
    VIE. For the Company, this includes its consolidated development
    partnerships as the Company provides substantially all of the
    capital for these ventures (other than third party mortgage
    debt, if any). For the Company, these requirements affected only
    disclosures and had no impact on the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations or financial position. See Note 6 for
    further discussion.

The Company is required to make certain disclosures regarding
    noncontrolling interests in consolidated limited-life
    subsidiaries. The Company is the controlling partner in various
    consolidated partnerships owning 24 properties and 5,232
    apartment units and various completed and uncompleted
    development properties having a noncontrolling interest book
    value of $8.0 million at December 31, 2010. Some of
    these partnership agreements contain provisions that require the
    partnerships to be liquidated through the sale of their assets
    upon reaching a date specified in each respective partnership
    agreement. The Company, as controlling partner, has an
    obligation to cause the property owning partnerships to
    distribute the proceeds of liquidation to the Noncontrolling
    Interests in these Partially Owned Properties only to the extent
    that the net proceeds received by the partnerships from the sale
    of their assets warrant a distribution based on the partnership
    agreements. As of December 31, 2010, the Company estimates
    the value of Noncontrolling Interest distributions would have
    been approximately $53.0 million (“Settlement
    Value”) had the partnerships been liquidated. This
    Settlement Value is based on estimated third party consideration
    realized by the partnerships upon disposition of the Partially
    Owned Properties and is net of all other assets and liabilities,
    including yield maintenance on the mortgages encumbering the
    properties, that would have been due on December 31, 2010
    had those mortgages been prepaid. Due to, among other things,
    the inherent uncertainty in the sale of real estate assets, the
    amount of any potential distribution to the Noncontrolling
    Interests in the Company’s Partially Owned Properties is
    subject to change. To the extent that the partnerships’
    underlying assets are worth less than the underlying
    liabilities, the Company has no obligation to remit any
    consideration to the Noncontrolling Interests in these Partially
    Owned Properties.

Effective beginning the quarter ended June 30, 2009,
    disclosures about fair value of financial instruments are
    required for interim reporting periods in summarized financial
    information for publicly traded companies as well as in annual
    financial

F-17


statements. This does not have a material effect on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial
    position. See Note 11 for further discussion.

Effective January 1, 2010, companies are required to
    separately disclose the amounts of significant transfers of
    assets and liabilities into and out of Level 1,
    Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and
    the reasons for those transfers. Companies must also develop and
    disclose their policy for determining when transfers between
    levels are recognized. In addition, companies are required to
    provide fair value disclosures for each class rather than each
    major category of assets and liabilities. For fair value
    measurements using significant other observable inputs
    (Level 2) or significant unobservable inputs
    (Level 3), companies are required to disclose the valuation
    technique and the inputs used in determining fair value for each
    class of assets and liabilities. This does not have a material
    effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations
    or financial position. See Note 11 for further discussion.

Effective January 1, 2011, companies will be required to
    separately disclose purchases, sales, issuances and settlements
    on a gross basis in the reconciliation of recurring Level 3
    fair value measurements. The Company does not expect this will
    have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations
    or financial position.

Effective January 1, 2009, in an effort to improve
    financial standards for derivative instruments and hedging
    activities, companies are required to enhance disclosures to
    enable investors to better understand their effects on an
    entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash
    flows. Among other requirements, entities are required to
    provide enhanced disclosures about: (1) how and why an
    entity uses derivative instruments; (2) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items are accounted for; and
    (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    affect an entity’s financial position, financial
    performance and cash flows. Other than the enhanced disclosure
    requirements, this does not have a material effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. See
    Note 11 for further discussion.

Effective January 1, 2009, issuers of certain convertible
    debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion were
    required to separately account for the liability and equity
    components of the instrument in a manner that reflects each
    issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. As the Company
    is required to apply this retrospectively, the accounting for
    the Operating Partnership’s $650.0 million
    ($482.5 million outstanding at December 31,
    2010) 3.85% convertible unsecured notes that were issued in
    August 2006 and mature in August 2026 was affected. The Company
    recognized $18.6 million, $20.6 million and
    $24.4 million in interest expense related to the stated
    coupon rate of 3.85% for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The amount of the conversion option
    as of the date of issuance calculated by the Company using a
    5.80% effective interest rate was $44.3 million and is
    being amortized to interest expense over the expected life of
    the convertible notes (through the first put date on
    August 18, 2011). Total amortization of the cash discount
    and conversion option discount on the unsecured notes resulted
    in a reduction to earnings of approximately $7.8 million
    and $10.6 million, respectively, or $0.03 per share and
    $0.04 per share, respectively, for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and is anticipated to result in
    a reduction to earnings of approximately $5.0 million or
    $0.02 per share for the year ended December 31, 2011. In
    addition, the Company decreased the January 1, 2009 balance
    of retained earnings by $27.0 million, decreased the
    January 1, 2009 balance of notes by $17.3 million and
    increased the January 1, 2009 balance of paid in capital by
    $44.3 million. Due to the required retrospective
    application, it resulted in a reduction to earnings of
    approximately $13.3 million or $0.05 per share for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. The carrying amount of the
    conversion option remaining in paid in capital was
    $44.3 million at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. The
    unamortized cash and conversion option discounts totaled
    $5.0 million and $12.8 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

An unlimited amount of equity and debt securities remains
    available for issuance by the Company and the Operating
    Partnership under effective shelf registration statements filed
    with the SEC. Most recently, the Company and the Operating
    Partnership filed a universal shelf registration statement for
    an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities that became
    automatically effective upon filing with the SEC in October 2010
    (under SEC regulations enacted in 2005, the registration
    statement automatically expires on October 14, 2013 and
    does not contain a maximum issuance amount).

In September 2009, the Company announced the establishment of an

At-The-Market

(“ATM”) share offering program which would allow the
    Company to sell up to 17.0 million Common Shares from time
    to time over the next three years into the existing trading
    market at current market prices as well as through negotiated
    transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the
    Company issued approximately 6.2 million Common Shares at
    an average price of $47.45 per share for total consideration of
    approximately $291.9 million through the ATM program.
    During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company issued
    approximately 3.5 million Common Shares at an average price
    of $35.38 per share for total consideration of approximately
    $123.7 million through the ATM program. As of
    December 31, 2009, transactions to issue approximately
    1.1 million of the 3.5 million Common Shares had not
    yet settled. As of December 31, 2009, the Company increased
    the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding by this
    amount and recorded a receivable of approximately
    $37.6 million included in other assets on the consolidated
    balance sheets. See Note 20 for further discussion on
    shares available under this program.

EQR has a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of
    Trustees. Considering the repurchase activity for the year ended
    December 31, 2010, EQR has remaining authorization to
    repurchase an additional $464.6 million of its shares as of
    December 31, 2010.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    repurchased 58,130 of its Common Shares at an average price of
    $32.46 per share for total consideration of $1.9 million.
    These shares were retired subsequent to the repurchases. All of
    the shares repurchased during the year ended December 31,
    2010 were repurchased from employees at the then current market
    prices to cover the minimum statutory tax withholding
    obligations related to the vesting of employees’ restricted
    shares.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    repurchased 47,450 of its Common Shares at an average price of
    $23.69 per share for total consideration of $1.1 million.
    These shares were retired subsequent to the repurchases. All of
    the shares repurchased during the year ended December 31,
    2009 were repurchased from employees at the then current market
    prices to cover the minimum statutory tax withholding
    obligations related to the vesting of employees’ restricted
    shares.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    repurchased 220,085 of its Common Shares at an average price of
    $35.93 per share for total consideration of $7.9 million.
    These shares were retired subsequent to the repurchases. Of the
    total shares repurchased, 120,085 shares were repurchased
    from employees at an average price of $36.10 per share (the
    average of the then current market prices) to cover the minimum
    statutory tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of
    employees’ restricted shares. The remaining
    100,000 shares were repurchased in the open market at an
    average price of $35.74 per share.

The equity positions of various individuals and entities that
    contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in
    exchange for OP Units, as well as the equity positions of
    the holders of LTIP Units, are collectively referred to as the
    “Noncontrolling Interests – Operating
    Partnership”. Subject to certain exceptions (including the

“book-up”

requirements of LTIP Units), the Noncontrolling
    Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their
    Units with EQR for Common Shares on a

one-for-one

basis. The carrying value of the Noncontrolling
    Interests – Operating Partnership (including
    redeemable interests) is allocated based on the number of
    Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership Units
    in total in proportion to the number of Noncontrolling
    Interests – Operating Partnership Units in total plus
    the number of EQR Common Shares. Net income is allocated to the
    Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership based
    on the weighted average ownership percentage during the period.

The Operating Partnership has the right but not the obligation
    to make a cash payment instead of issuing Common Shares to any
    and all holders of Noncontrolling Interests –
    Operating Partnership Units requesting an exchange of their
    OP Units with EQR. Once the Operating Partnership elects
    not to redeem the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating
    Partnership Units for cash, EQR is obligated to deliver Common
    Shares to the exchanging holder of the Noncontrolling
    Interests – Operating Partnership Units.

The Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership
    Units are classified as either mezzanine equity or permanent
    equity. If EQR is required, either by contract or securities
    law, to deliver registered Common Shares, such Noncontrolling
    Interests – Operating Partnership are differentiated
    and referred to as “Redeemable Noncontrolling
    Interests – Operating Partnership”. Instruments
    that require settlement in registered shares can not be
    classified in permanent equity as it is not always completely
    within an issuer’s control to deliver registered shares.
    Therefore, settlement in cash is assumed and that responsibility
    for settlement in cash is deemed to fall to the Operating
    Partnership as the primary source of cash for EQR, resulting in
    presentation in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The
    Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating
    Partnership are adjusted to the greater of carrying value or
    fair market value based on the Common Share price of EQR at the
    end of each respective reporting period. EQR has the ability to
    deliver unregistered Common Shares for the remaining portion of
    the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership
    Units that are classified in permanent equity at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

The carrying value of the Redeemable Noncontrolling
    Interests – Operating Partnership is allocated based
    on the number of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests –
    Operating Partnership Units in proportion to the number of
    Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership Units
    in total. Such percentage of the total carrying value of Units
    which is ascribed to the Redeemable Noncontrolling
    Interests – Operating Partnership is then adjusted to
    the greater of carrying value or fair market value as described
    above. As of December 31, 2010, the Redeemable
    Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership have
    a redemption value of approximately $383.5 million, which
    represents the value of Common Shares that would be issued in
    exchange with the Redeemable Noncontrolling
    Interests – Operating Partnership Units.

The following table presents the changes in the redemption value
    of the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating

Net proceeds from the Company’s Common Share and Preferred
    Share (see definition below) offerings are contributed by the
    Company to the Operating Partnership. In return for those
    contributions, EQR receives a number of OP Units in the
    Operating Partnership equal to the number of Common Shares it
    has issued in the equity offering (or in the case of a preferred
    equity offering, a number of preference units in the Operating
    Partnership equal in number and having the same terms as the
    Preferred Shares issued in the equity offering). As a result,
    the net offering proceeds from Common Shares and Preferred
    Shares are allocated between shareholders’ equity and
    Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership to
    account for the change in their respective percentage ownership
    of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

The Company’s declaration of trust authorizes the Company
    to issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares of beneficial
    interest, $0.01 par value per share (the “Preferred
    Shares”), with specific rights, preferences and other
    attributes as the Board of Trustees may determine, which may
    include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the
    rights of holders of the Company’s Common Shares.

On March 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership issued 188,571
    OP Units at a price of $39.15 per OP Unit for total
    valuation of $7.4 million as partial consideration for the
    acquisition of one rental property. As the value of the
    OP Units issued was agreed by contract to be $35.00 per
    OP Unit, the difference between the contracted value and
    fair value (the closing price of Common Shares on the closing
    date) was recorded as an increase to the purchase price.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    acquired all of its partner’s interest in two consolidated
    partially owned properties consisting of 432 apartment units,
    one consolidated partially owned development project and one
    consolidated partially owned land parcel for $0.7 million.
    One of these partially owned property buyouts was funded through
    the issuance of 1,129 OP Units valued at $50,000. The
    Company also increased its ownership in three consolidated
    partially owned properties through the buyout of certain equity
    interests which were funded through the issuance of 15,948
    OP Units valued at $0.8 million and cash payments of
    $15.3 million. In conjunction with these transactions, the
    Company reduced paid in capital by $16.9 million and other
    liabilities by $0.2 million and increased Noncontrolling
    Interests – Partially Owned Properties by
    $0.2 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    acquired all of its partners’ interests in five
    consolidated partially owned properties consisting of 1,587
    apartment units for $9.2 million. In addition, the Company
    also acquired a portion of the outside partner interests in two
    consolidated partially owned properties, one funded using cash
    of $2.1 million and the other funded through the issuance
    of 32,061 OP Units valued at $0.8 million. In
    conjunction with these transactions, the Company reduced paid in
    capital by $1.5 million and Noncontrolling
    Interests – Partially Owned Properties by
    $11.7 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    acquired all of its partners’ interests in one consolidated
    partially owned property consisting of 144 apartment units for
    $5.9 million and three consolidated partially owned land
    parcels for $1.6 million. In addition, the Company made an
    additional payment of $1.3 million related to an April 2006
    acquisition of a partner’s interest in a now wholly owned
    property, partially funded through the issuance of 19,017
    OP Units valued at $0.8 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    acquired the 75% equity interest it did not own in seven
    previously unconsolidated properties containing 1,811 apartment
    units in exchange for an approximate $30.0 million payment
    to its partner. In addition, the Company repaid the net
    $70.0 million mortgage loan, which was to mature on
    May 1, 2010, concurrent with closing using proceeds drawn
    from the Company’s line of credit. The Company also sold
    its 25% equity interest in the remaining 24 unconsolidated
    properties containing 5,635 apartment units in exchange for an
    approximate $25.4 million payment from its partner and the
    related $264.8 million in non-recourse mortgage debt was
    extinguished by the partner at closing.

On December 29, 2010, the Company admitted an 80%
    institutional partner to an entity owning a developable land
    parcel in Florida in exchange for $11.7 million in cash and
    retained a 20% equity interest. This land parcel is now
    unconsolidated. Total project cost is approximately
    $76.1 million and construction is expected to start in the
    first quarter of 2011. The Company is responsible for
    constructing the project and has given certain construction cost
    overun guarantees.

The Company is the controlling partner in various consolidated
    partnership properties and development properties having a
    noncontrolling interest book value of $8.0 million at
    December 31, 2010. The Company has identified its
    development partnerships as VIEs as the Company provides
    substantially all of the capital for these ventures (other than
    third party mortgage debt, if any) despite the fact that each
    partner legally owns 50% of each venture. The Company is the
    primary beneficiary as it exerts the most significant power over
    the ventures, absorbs the majority of the expected losses and
    has the right to receive a majority of the expected residual
    returns. The assets net of liabilities of the Company’s
    VIEs are restricted in their use to the

F-25


specific VIE to which they relate and are not available for
    general corporate use. The Company does not have any
    unconsolidated VIEs.

On October 11, 2007, the Operating Partnership closed on a
    $500.0 million senior unsecured term loan. Effective
    April 12, 2010, the Company exercised the first of its two
    one-year extension options. As a result, the maturity date is
    now October 5, 2011 and there is one remaining one-year
    extension option exercisable by the Company. The Operating
    Partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings by
    an additional $250.0 million under certain circumstances.
    The loan bears interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR plus
    a spread (currently 0.50%) dependent upon the current credit
    rating on the Operating Partnership’s long-term senior
    unsecured debt. EQR has guaranteed the Operating
    Partnership’s term loan up to the maximum amount and for
    the full term of the loan.

On August 23, 2006, the Operating Partnership issued
    $650.0 million of exchangeable senior notes that mature on
    August 15, 2026. The notes have a current face value of
    $482.5 million at December 31, 2010 and bear interest
    at a fixed rate of 3.85%. The notes are exchangeable into EQR
    Common Shares, at the option of the holders, under specific
    circumstances or on or after August 15, 2025, at an initial
    and current exchange rate of 16.3934 shares per $1,000
    principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial and current
    exchange price of $61.00 per share). The exchange rate is
    subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including upon
    an increase in the Company’s dividend rate at the time of
    issuance. Upon an exchange of the notes, the Operating
    Partnership will settle any amounts up to the principal amount
    of the notes in cash and the remaining exchange value, if any,
    will be settled, at the Operating Partnership’s option, in
    cash, EQR Common Shares or a combination of both. See
    Note 2 for more information on the change in the
    recognition of interest expense for the exchangeable senior
    notes.

On or after August 18, 2011, the Operating Partnership may
    redeem the notes at a redemption price equal to the principal
    amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest
    thereon. Upon notice of redemption by the Operating Partnership,
    the holders may elect to exercise their exchange rights. In
    addition, on August 18, 2011, August 15, 2016 and
    August 15, 2021 or following the occurrence of certain
    change in control transactions prior to August 18, 2011,
    note holders may require the Operating Partnership to repurchase
    the notes for an amount equal to the principal amount of the
    notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

Note holders may also require an exchange of the notes should
    the closing sale price of Common Shares exceed 130% of the
    exchange price for a certain period of time or should the
    trading price on the notes be less than 98% of the product of
    the closing sales price of Common Shares multiplied by the
    applicable exchange rate for a certain period of time.

Lines of
    Credit

The Operating Partnership has a $1.425 billion (net of
    $75.0 million which had been committed by a now bankrupt
    financial institution and is not available for borrowing)
    unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on
    February 28, 2012, with the ability to increase available
    borrowings by an additional $500.0 million by adding
    additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of
    existing banks to increase their commitments. Advances under the
    credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR
    at various interest periods plus a spread (currently 0.50%)
    dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s credit rating or
    based on bids received from the lending group. EQR has
    guaranteed the Operating Partnership’s credit facility up
    to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.

As of December 31, 2010, the amount available on the credit
    facility was $1.28 billion (net of $147.3 million
    which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and
    net of the $75.0 million discussed above) and there was no
    amount outstanding. During the year ended December 31,
    2010, the weighted average interest rate was 0.66%. As of
    December 31, 2009, the amount available on the credit
    facility was $1.37 billion (net of $56.7 million which
    was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of
    the $75.0 million discussed above). The Company did not
    draw and had no balance outstanding on its revolving credit
    facility at any time during the year ended December 31,
    2009.

Derivative
    and Other Fair Value Instruments

The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to
    make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
    instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values
    of its financial instruments, including its derivative
    instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes.
    Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates
    on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on
    other factors relevant to the financial instruments.

The carrying values of the Company’s mortgage notes payable
    and unsecured notes were approximately $4.8 billion and
    $5.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The
    fair values of the Company’s mortgage notes payable and
    unsecured notes were approximately $4.7 billion and
    $5.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The
    carrying values of the Company’s mortgage notes payable and
    unsecured notes were approximately $4.8 billion and
    $4.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The
    fair values of the Company’s mortgage notes payable and
    unsecured notes were approximately $4.6 billion and
    $4.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The
    fair values of the Company’s financial instruments (other
    than mortgage notes payable, unsecured notes, derivative
    instruments and investment securities) including cash and cash
    equivalents and other financial instruments, approximate their
    carrying or contract values.

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the
    effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to manage
    these risks by following established risk management policies
    and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge
    interest rate risk on debt instruments.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were approximately
    $58.3 million in deferred losses, net, included in
    accumulated other comprehensive (loss) and $4.2 million in
    deferred gains, net, included in accumulated other comprehensive
    income, respectively, related to derivative instruments. Based
    on the estimated fair values of the net derivative instruments
    at December 31, 2010, the Company may recognize an
    estimated $5.6 million of accumulated other comprehensive
    (loss) as additional interest expense during the year ending
    December 31, 2011.

In July 2010, the Company paid approximately $10.0 million
    to settle a forward starting swap in conjunction with the
    issuance of $600.0 million of ten-year fixed rate public
    notes. The entire amount was deferred as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being recognized as
    an increase to interest expense over the term of the notes.

In January 2009, the Company received approximately
    $0.4 million to terminate a fair value hedge of interest
    rates in conjunction with the public tender of the
    Company’s 4.75% fixed rate public notes due June 15,
    2009. Approximately $0.2 million of the settlement received
    was deferred and recognized as a reduction of interest expense
    through the maturity on June 15, 2009.

In April and May 2009, the Company received approximately
    $10.8 million to terminate six treasury locks in
    conjunction with the issuance of a $500.0 million

11-year

mortgage loan. The entire amount was deferred as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized as a
    reduction of interest expense over the first ten years of the
    mortgage loan.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company sold a
    majority of its investment securities, receiving proceeds of
    approximately $215.8 million, and recorded a
    $4.9 million realized gain on sale (specific
    identification) which is included in interest and other income.

A three-level valuation hierarchy exists for disclosure of fair
    value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the
    transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability
    as of the measurement date. A financial instrument’s
    categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the
    lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
    measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:

n

Level 1 – Inputs to
    the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for
    identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

n

Level 2 – Inputs to
    the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar
    assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are
    observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
    indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
    instrument.

n

Level 3 – Inputs to
    the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to
    the fair value measurement.

The Company’s derivative positions are valued using models
    developed by the respective counterparty as well as models
    developed internally by the Company that use as their basis
    readily observable market parameters (such as forward yield
    curves and credit default swap data) and are classified within
    Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. In addition, employee
    holdings other than Common Shares within the supplemental
    executive retirement plan (the “SERP”) have a fair
    value of $58.1 million as of December 31, 2010 and are
    included in other assets and other liabilities on the
    consolidated balance sheet. These SERP investments are valued
    using quoted market prices for identical assets and are
    classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

The Company’s investment securities are valued using quoted
    market prices or readily available market interest rate data.
    The quoted market prices are classified within Level 1 of
    the valuation hierarchy and the market interest rate data are
    classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
    Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating
    Partnership are valued using the quoted market price of Common
    Shares and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation
    hierarchy.

The Company’s real estate asset impairment charges were the
    result of an analysis of the parcels’ estimated fair value
    (determined using internally developed models that were based on
    market assumptions and comparable sales data)
    (Level 3) compared to their current capitalized
    carrying value. The market assumptions used as inputs to the
    Company’s fair value model include construction costs,
    leasing assumptions, growth rates, discount rates, terminal
    capitalization rates and development yields, along with the
    Company’s current plans for each individual asset. The
    Company uses data on its existing portfolio of properties and
    its recent acquisition and development properties, as well as
    similar market data from third party sources, when available, in
    determining these inputs. The valuation techniques used to
    measure fair value is consistent with how similar assets were
    measured in prior periods. See Note 20 for further
    discussion.

Potential common shares issuable
    from the assumed conversion of OP Units and the exercise/vesting
    of long-term compensation award shares/units are automatically
    anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the diluted earnings
    per share calculation as the Company had a loss from continuing
    operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.

Convertible preferred shares/units that could be converted
    into 325,103, 402,501 and 427,090 weighted average Common Shares
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the
    computation of diluted earnings per share because the effects
    would be anti-dilutive. In addition, the effect of the Common
    Shares that could ultimately be issued upon the
    conversion/exchange of the Operating Partnership’s
    $650.0 million ($482.5 million outstanding at
    December 31, 2010) exchangeable senior notes was not
    included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
    because the effects would be anti-dilutive.

    options and restricted shares, see Notes 2 and 14.

Share
    Incentive Plans

On May 15, 2002, the shareholders of EQR approved the
    Company’s 2002 Share Incentive Plan. The maximum
    aggregate number of awards that may be granted under this plan
    may not exceed 7.5% of the Company’s outstanding Common
    Shares calculated on a “fully diluted” basis and
    determined annually on the first day of each calendar year. As
    of January 1, 2011, this amount equaled 22,785,696, of
    which 5,395,739 shares were available for future issuance.
    No awards may be granted under the 2002 Share Incentive
    Plan, as restated, after February 20, 2012.

Pursuant to the 2002 Share Incentive Plan, as restated, and
    the Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award
    Plan, as amended (collectively the “Share Incentive
    Plans”), officers, trustees and key employees of the
    Company may be granted share options to acquire Common Shares
    (“Options”) including non-qualified share options
    (“NQSOs”), incentive share options (“ISOs”)
    and share appreciation rights (“SARs”), or may be
    granted restricted or non-restricted shares, subject to
    conditions and restrictions as described in the Share Incentive
    Plans. In addition, each year prior to 2007, certain executive
    officers of the Company participated in the Company’s
    performance-based restricted share plan. Effective
    January 1, 2007, the Company elected to discontinue the
    award of performance-based award grants. Options, SARs,
    restricted shares, performance shares and LTIP Units (see
    discussion below) are sometimes collectively referred to herein
    as “Awards”.

The Options are generally granted at the fair market value of
    the Company’s Common Shares at the date of grant, vest in
    three equal installments over a three-year period, are
    exercisable upon vesting and expire ten years from the date of
    grant. The exercise price for all Options under the Share
    Incentive Plans is equal to the fair market value of the
    underlying Common Shares at the time the Option is granted.
    Options exercised result in new Common Shares being issued on
    the open market. The Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option
    and Share Award Plan, as amended, will terminate at such time as
    all outstanding Awards have expired or have been
    exercised/vested. The Board of Trustees may at any time amend or
    terminate the Share Incentive Plans, but termination will not
    affect Awards previously granted. Any Options which had vested
    prior to such a termination would remain exercisable by the
    holder.

F-34


Restricted shares that have been awarded through
    December 31, 2010 generally vest three years from the award
    date. In addition, the Company’s unvested restricted
    shareholders have the same voting rights as any other Common
    Share holder. During the three-year period of restriction, the
    Company’s unvested restricted shareholders receive
    quarterly dividend payments on their shares at the same rate and
    on the same date as any other Common Share holder. As a result,
    dividends paid on unvested restricted shares are included as a
    component of retained earnings and have not been considered in
    reducing net income available to Common Shares in a manner
    similar to the Company’s preferred share dividends for the
    earnings per share calculation. If employment is terminated
    prior to the lapsing of the restriction, the shares are
    generally canceled.

In December 2008, the Company’s 2002 Share Incentive
    Plan was amended to allow for the issuance of long-term
    incentive plan units (“LTIP Units”) to officers of the
    Company as an alternative to the Company’s restricted
    shares. LTIP Units are a class of partnership interests that
    under certain conditions, including vesting, are convertible by
    the holder into an equal number of OP Units, which are
    redeemable by the holder for EQR Common Shares on a

one-for-one

basis or the cash value of such shares at the option of the
    Company. In connection with the February 2009 grant of long-term
    incentive compensation for services provided during 2008,
    officers of the Company were allowed to choose, on a

one-for-one

basis, between restricted shares and LTIP Units. Similar to
    restricted shares, LTIP Units generally vest three years from
    the award date. In addition, LTIP Unit holders receive quarterly
    dividend payments on their LTIP Units at the same rate and on
    the same date as any other OP Unit holder. As a result,
    dividends paid on LTIP Units are included as a component of
    Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership and
    have not been considered in reducing net income available to
    Common Shares in a manner similar to the Company’s
    preferred share dividends for the earnings per share
    calculation. If employment is terminated prior to vesting, the
    LTIP Units are generally canceled. An LTIP Unit will
    automatically convert to an OP Unit when the capital
    account of each LTIP Unit increases

(“books-up”)

to a specified target. If the capital target is not attained
    within ten years following the date of issuance, the LTIP Unit
    will automatically be canceled and no compensation will be
    payable to the holder of such canceled LTIP Unit.

The Company’s Share Incentive Plans provide for certain
    benefits upon retirement at or after age 62. As of
    November 4, 2008, but effective as of January 1, 2009,
    the Company changed the definition of retirement for employees
    (including all officers but not non-employee members of the
    Company’s Board of Trustees) under its Share Incentive
    Plans. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2009,
    retirement generally will mean the termination of employment
    (other than for cause): (i) on or after age 62; or
    (ii) prior to age 62 after meeting the requirements of
    the Rule of 70 (described below). For employees hired after
    January 1, 2009, retirement generally will mean the
    termination of employment (other than for cause) after meeting
    the requirements of the Rule of 70.

The Rule of 70 is met when an employee’s years of service
    with the Company (which must be at least 15 years) plus his
    or her age (which must be at least 55 years) on the date of
    termination equals or exceeds 70 years. In addition, the
    employee must give the Company at least 6 months’
    advance written notice of his or her intention to retire and
    sign a release upon termination of employment, releasing the
    Company from customary claims and agreeing to ongoing
    non-competition and employee non-solicitation provisions.

John Powers, Executive Vice President – Human
    Resources, became eligible for retirement in 2009 as he turned
    62. Frederick C. Tuomi, President – Property
    Management, became eligible for retirement under the Rule of 70
    in 2009. Bruce C. Strohm, Executive Vice President and General
    Counsel, became eligible for retirement under the Rule of 70 in
    2010. David J. Neithercut, Chief Executive Officer and
    President, will become eligible for retirement under the Rule of
    70 in 2011.

For employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, who retire at
    or after age 62, such employee’s unvested restricted
    shares, LTIP Units and share options would immediately vest, and
    share options would continue to be exercisable for the balance
    of the applicable ten-year option period, as was provided under
    the Share Incentive Plans prior to the adoption of the Rule of
    70. For all other employees (those hired after January 1,
    2009 and those hired before such date who choose to retire prior
    to age 62), upon such retirement under the new Rule of 70
    definition of retirement of employees, such employee’s
    unvested restricted shares, LTIP Units and share options would
    continue to vest per the original vesting schedule (subject to
    immediate vesting upon the occurrence of a subsequent change in
    control of the Company or the employee’s death), and
    options would continue to be exercisable for the balance of the
    applicable ten-year option period, subject to the
    employee’s compliance with the non-competition and employee
    non-solicitation provisions. If an employee violates these
    provisions after such retirement, all unvested restricted
    shares, unvested LTIP Units and unvested and vested share
    options at the time of the violation would be void, unless
    otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee of the
    Company’s Board of Trustees.

Compensation expense is generally recognized for Awards as
    follows:

n

Restricted shares, LTIP Units and share options –
    Straight-line method over the vesting period of the options or
    shares regardless of cliff or ratable vesting distinctions.

n

Performance shares – Accelerated method with each
    vesting tranche valued as a separate award, with a separate
    vesting date, consistent with the estimated value of the award
    at each period end.

n

ESPP discount – Immediately upon the purchase of
    common shares each quarter.

The Company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense
    for all Awards for those individuals approaching or meeting the
    retirement age criteria discussed above. The total compensation
    expense related to Awards not yet vested at December 31,
    2010 is $19.5 million, which is expected to be recognized
    over a weighted average term of 1.5 years.

See Note 2 for additional information regarding the
    Company’s share-based compensation.

Employee
    Plans

The Company established an Employee Share Purchase Plan to
    provide each employee and trustee the ability to annually
    acquire up to $100,000 of Common Shares of the Company. In 2003,
    the Company’s shareholders approved an increase in the
    aggregate number of Common Shares available under the ESPP to
    7,000,000 (from 2,000,000). The Company has 3,403,970 Common
    Shares available for purchase under the ESPP at
    December 31, 2010. The Common Shares may be purchased
    quarterly at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of: (a) the
    closing price for a share on the last day of such quarter; and
    (b) the greater of: (i) the closing price for a share
    on the first day of such quarter, and (ii) the average
    closing price for a share for all the business days in the
    quarter. The following table summarizes information regarding
    the Common Shares issued under the ESPP:

The Company established a defined contribution plan (the
    “401(k) Plan”) to provide retirement benefits for
    employees that meet minimum employment criteria. The Company
    matches dollar for dollar up to the first 3% of eligible
    compensation that a participant contributes to the 401(k) Plan.
    Participants are vested in the Company’s contributions over
    five years. The Company recognized an expense in the amount of
    $4.0 million, $3.5 million and $3.8 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

The Company may also elect to make an annual discretionary
    profit-sharing contribution as a percentage of each individual
    employee’s eligible compensation under the 401(k) Plan. The
    Company did not make a contribution for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 and as such, no expense
    was recognized in these years.

The Company established a supplemental executive retirement plan
    (the “SERP”) to provide certain officers and trustees
    an opportunity to defer a portion of their eligible compensation
    in order to save for retirement. The SERP is restricted to
    investments in Company Common Shares, certain marketable
    securities that have been specifically approved and cash
    equivalents. The deferred compensation liability represented in
    the SERP and the securities issued to fund such deferred
    compensation liability are consolidated by the Company and
    carried on the Company’s balance sheet, and the
    Company’s Common Shares held in the SERP are accounted for
    as a reduction to paid in capital.

16.

Distribution
    Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan

On November 3, 1997, the Company filed with the SEC a

Form S-3

Registration Statement to register 14,000,000 Common Shares
    pursuant to a Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan
    (the “DRIP Plan”). The registration statement was
    declared effective on November 25, 1997. The remaining
    shares available for issuance under the 1997 registration lapsed
    in December 2008.

On December 16, 2008, the Company filed with the SEC a

Form S-3

Registration Statement to register 5,000,000 Common Shares under
    the DRIP Plan. The registration statement was automatically
    declared effective the same day and expires at the earlier of
    the date in which all 5,000,000 shares have been issued or
    December 15, 2011. The Company has 4,905,736 Common Shares
    available for issuance under the DRIP Plan at December 31,
    2010.

The DRIP Plan provides holders of record and beneficial owners
    of Common Shares and Preferred Shares with a simple and
    convenient method of investing cash distributions in additional
    Common Shares (which is referred to herein as the “Dividend
    Reinvestment – DRIP Plan”). Common Shares may
    also be purchased on a monthly basis with optional cash payments
    made by participants in the DRIP Plan and interested new
    investors, not currently shareholders of the Company, at the
    market price of the Common Shares less a discount ranging
    between 0% and 5%, as determined in accordance with the DRIP
    Plan (which is referred to herein as the “Share
    Purchase – DRIP Plan”). Common Shares purchased
    under the DRIP Plan may, at the option of the Company, be
    directly issued by the Company or purchased by the
    Company’s transfer agent in the open market using
    participants’ funds.

F-38


17.

Transactions
    with Related Parties

The Company provided asset and property management services to
    certain related entities for properties not owned by the
    Company, which terminated in December 2008. Fees received for
    providing such services were approximately $0.3 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008.

The Company leases its corporate headquarters from an entity
    controlled by EQR’s Chairman of the Board of Trustees. The
    lease terminates on July 31, 2021. Amounts incurred for
    such office space for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, were approximately
    $2.7 million, $3.0 million and $2.9 million. The
    Company believes these amounts equal market rates for such
    rental space.

18.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various
    Federal, state and local environmental laws. Compliance by the
    Company with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect
    on the Company. However, the Company cannot predict the impact
    of new or changed laws or regulations on its current properties
    or on properties that it may acquire in the future.

The Company is party to a housing discrimination lawsuit brought
    by a non-profit civil rights organization in April 2006 in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The suit
    alleges that the Company designed and built approximately 300 of
    its properties in violation of the accessibility requirements of
    the Fair Housing Act and Americans With Disabilities Act. The
    suit seeks actual and punitive damages, injunctive relief
    (including modification of non-compliant properties), costs and
    attorneys’ fees. The Company believes it has a number of
    viable defenses, including that a majority of the named
    properties were completed before the operative dates of the
    statutes in question

and/or

were
    not designed or built by the Company. Accordingly, the Company
    is defending the suit vigorously. Due to the pendency of the
    Company’s defenses and the uncertainty of many other
    critical factual and legal issues, it is not possible to
    determine or predict the outcome of the suit or a possible loss
    or a range of loss, and no amounts have been accrued at
    December 31, 2010. While no assurances can be given, the
    Company does not believe that the suit, if adversely determined,
    would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company does not believe there is any other litigation
    pending or threatened against it that, individually or in the
    aggregate, may reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
    effect on the Company.

The Company has established a reserve and recorded a
    corresponding reduction to its net gain on sales of discontinued
    operations related to potential liabilities associated with its
    condominium conversion activities. The reserve covers potential
    product liability related to each conversion. The Company
    periodically assesses the adequacy of the reserve and makes
    adjustments as necessary. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Company recorded additional reserves
    of approximately $0.7 million, paid approximately
    $2.9 million in claims, settlements and legal fees and
    released approximately $1.2 million of remaining reserves
    for settled claims. As a result, the Company had total reserves
    of approximately $3.3 million at December 31, 2010.
    While no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe
    that the ultimate resolution of these potential liabilities, if
    adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on
    the Company.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company has four projects
    totaling 717 apartment units in various stages of development
    with estimated completion dates ranging through
    September 30, 2012, as well as other completed development
    projects that are in various stages of lease up or are
    stabilized. Some of the projects are developed solely by the
    Company, while others were co-developed with various third party
    development partners. The development venture agreements with
    partners are primarily deal-specific, with differing terms
    regarding profit-sharing, equity contributions, returns on
    investment, buy-sell agreements and other customary provisions.
    The partner is most often the “general” or
    “managing” partner of the development venture. The
    typical buy-sell arrangements contain appraisal rights and
    provisions that provide the right, but not the obligation, for
    the Company to acquire the partner’s interest in the
    project at fair market value upon the expiration of a negotiated
    time period (typically two to five years after substantial
    completion of the project).

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    total operating lease payments incurred for office space,
    including a portion of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and
    utilities, and including rent due under three ground leases,
    aggregated $7.6 million, $8.4 million and
    $8.3 million, respectively.

The Company has entered into a retirement benefits agreement
    with its Chairman of the Board of Trustees and deferred
    compensation agreements with its Vice Chairman and two former
    chief executive officers. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized
    compensation expense of $0.9 million and $1.2 million,
    respectively, related to these agreements. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company reduced compensation expense
    by $0.4 million related to these agreements.

Reportable
    Segments

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
    about which separate financial information is available that is
    evaluated regularly by senior management. Senior management
    decides how resources are allocated and assesses performance on
    a monthly basis.

The Company’s primary business is the acquisition,
    development and management of multifamily residential
    properties, which includes the generation of rental and other
    related income through the leasing of apartment units to
    residents. Senior management evaluates the performance of each
    of our apartment communities individually and geographically,
    and both on a same store and non-same store basis; however, each
    of our apartment communities generally has similar economic
    characteristics, residents, products and services. The
    Company’s operating segments have been aggregated by
    geography in a manner identical to that which is provided to its
    chief operating decision maker.

The Company’s fee and asset management, development
    (including its partially owned properties), condominium
    conversion and corporate housing (Equity Corporate Housing or
    “ECH”) activities are immaterial and do not
    individually meet the threshold requirements of a reportable
    segment and as such, have been aggregated in the
    “Other” segment in the tables presented below.

All revenues are from external customers and there is no
    customer who contributed 10% or more of the Company’s total
    revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 or 2008.

The primary financial measure for the Company’s rental real
    estate segment is net operating income (“NOI”), which
    represents rental income less: 1) property and maintenance
    expense; 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense; and
    3) property management expense (all as reflected in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations). The Company
    believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental
    measure of its operating performance because it is a direct
    measure of the actual operating results of the Company’s
    apartment communities. Current year NOI is compared to prior
    year NOI and current year budgeted NOI as a measure of financial
    performance. The following tables present NOI for each segment
    from our rental real estate specific to continuing operations
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, as well as total assets for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively (amounts in

Other

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    recorded a $45.4 million non-cash asset impairment charge
    on two parcels of land held for development as a result of
    changes in the Company’s future plans for those parcels.
    The Company now intends to sell one parcel in the near term and
    contemplates a joint venture structure for the other,
    necessitating this impairment charge. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company recorded an
    $11.1 million non-cash asset impairment charge on a parcel
    of land held for development. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company recorded $116.4 million
    of non-cash asset impairment charges on land held for
    development related to five potential development projects that
    will no longer be pursued. These charges were the result of an
    analysis of each parcel’s estimated fair value (determined
    using internally developed models that were based on market
    assumptions and comparable sales data) compared to its current
    capitalized carrying value. The market assumptions used as
    inputs to the Company’s fair value model include
    construction costs, leasing assumptions, growth rates, discount
    rates, terminal capitalization rates and development yields,
    along with the Company’s current plans for each individual
    asset. The Company uses data on its existing portfolio of
    properties and its recent acquisition and development
    properties, as well as similar market data from third party
    sources, when available, in determining these inputs.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    the Company incurred charges of $6.6 million,
    $1.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively, related
    to property acquisition costs, such as survey, title and legal
    fees, on the acquisition of operating properties and
    $5.3 million, $4.8 million and $5.6 million,
    respectively, related to the write-off of various pursuit and

out-of-pocket

costs for terminated acquisition, disposition and development
    transactions. These costs, totaling $11.9 million,
    $6.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively, are
    included in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    recognized $0.7 million of forfeited deposits for various
    terminated transactions, which are included in interest and
    other income. During the year ended December 31, 2010, an
    arbitration panel awarded commissions, interest and costs in the
    amount of $1.7 million to the listing and marketing agent
    related to 38 potential condo sales at one of the Company’s
    properties. In addition, during 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    received $5.2 million, $0.2 million and
    $1.7 million, respectively, for the settlement of
    litigation/insurance claims, which are included in interest and
    other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    operations.

On July 16, 2010, a portion of the parking garage collapsed
    at one of the Company’s rental properties (Prospect Towers
    in Hackensack, New Jersey). The Company estimates that the costs
    related to such collapse (both expensed and capitalized),
    including providing for residents’ interim needs, lost
    revenue and garage reconstruction, will be approximately
    $12.0 million, after insurance reimbursements of
    $8.0 million. Costs to rebuild the garage will be
    capitalized as incurred. Other costs, like those

F-42


to accommodate displaced residents, lost revenue due to a
    portion of the property being temporarily unavailable for
    occupancy and legal costs, will reduce earnings as they are
    incurred. Generally, insurance proceeds will be recorded as
    increases to earnings as they are received. An impairment charge
    of $1.3 million was recognized to write-off the net book
    value of the collapsed garage. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Company received approximately
    $4.0 million in insurance proceeds which fully offset the
    impairment charge and partially offset expenses of
    $5.5 million that were recorded relating to this loss and
    are included in real estate taxes and insurance on the
    consolidated statements of operations.
