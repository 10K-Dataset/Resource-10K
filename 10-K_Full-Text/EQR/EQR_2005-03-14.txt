EQUITY RESIDENTIAL



Item 1

.

Business

General

Equity
Residential (“EQR”), formed in March 1993, is a fully integrated real estate
company engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership, management and
operation of multifamily properties.  EQR
has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”).

The Company is one of the
largest publicly traded real estate companies and is the largest publicly
traded owner of multifamily properties (based on the aggregate market value of
its outstanding Common Shares, the number of apartment units wholly owned and
total revenues earned).  The Company’s
corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also
leases (under operating leases) approximately thirty-five divisional, regional
and area property management offices throughout the United States.

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December
31, 2004 owned an approximate 93.3% ownership interest in ERP Operating Limited
Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).  The Company is structured as an umbrella
partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), under which all property ownership and business
operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its various
subsidiaries.  References to the “Company”
include EQR, the Operating Partnership and each of the partnerships, limited
liability companies and corporations controlled by the Operating Partnership or
EQR.

As of
December 31, 2004, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in
title holding entities, owned all or a portion of 939

properties
in 32 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 200,149 units.  The ownership breakdown includes:

As of March 1, 2005, the Company
has approximately 6,000 employees who provide real estate operations, leasing,
legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition, development and other
support functions.

Certain capitalized terms as used herein are defined
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Objectives and Operating
Strategies

The
Company seeks to maximize both current income and long-term growth in income,
thereby increasing:

•

the

value of the
properties;

•

distributions

on a per Common Share
basis; and

•

shareholders

’ value.


The
Company’s strategy for accomplishing these objectives include:

•

Leveraging our size and scale in four critical
ways:

•

Investing or “recycling” capital investments in
apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets, to maximize
our total return on an enterprise level;

•

Meeting the needs of our customers by offering a
wide array of product choices and a commitment to service;

•

Engaging, retaining, and attracting the best
people by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to
succeed; and

•

Sharing resources, customers and best practices
in property management and across the enterprise.

•

Owning a highly diversified portfolio by
investing in target markets defined by a combination of the following criteria:

•

High barrier-to-entry
(low supply);

•

Strong economic predictors
(high demand); and

•

Attractive quality of
life (high demand and retention).

•

Giving customers reasons to stay with Equity by
providing a range of product options available in our diversified portfolio and
by enhancing their experience through our employees and our services.

•

Being open and responsive to market realities to take advantage of
investment opportunities that align with our long-term vision.

Acquisition and Development
Strategies

The
Company anticipates that future property acquisitions and developments will
occur within the United States. 
Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of
capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity
and debt securities, sales of properties, joint venture agreements and
collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings. 
In addition, the Company may acquire additional properties in
transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the
Operating Partnership (“OP Units”) as consideration for the acquired
properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers
to defer, in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain, which might
otherwise result from the sales.

When evaluating potential acquisitions and
developments, the Company generally considers the following factors:

•

the

geographic area and
type of community;

•

the

location, construction
quality, condition and design of the property;

•

the

current and projected
cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow;

•

the

potential for capital
appreciation of the property;

•

the

terms of resident
leases, including the potential for rent increases;

•

income levels and employment growth trends in the
relevant market;

•

employment and household growth and net migration of
the relevant market’s population;

•

the

potential for economic
growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the
property is located;

•

the

occupancy and demand
by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity (the overall market
and submarket);


•

the

prospects for
liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property;

•

the

benefits of
integration into existing operations;

•

barriers to entry that would limit competition
(zoning laws, building permit availability, supply of undeveloped or
developable real estate, local building costs and construction labor costs
among other factors);

•

purchase prices and yields of available
existing stabilized communities, if any; and

•

competition

from existing
multifamily properties, residential properties under development and the
potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area.

Disposition Strategies

When
evaluating potential dispositions,

the Company generally
considers the following factors:

•

low

barrier-to-entry (high
supply);

•

weak

economic predictors
(low demand);

•

markets

where the Company does
not intend to establish long-term concentrations;

•

age

or location of a
particular property; and

•

opportunistic

selling based on
demand and price of high quality assets, including condominium conversions.

The Company generally
reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve
its acquisition and development strategies. 
In addition, when feasible, the Company may structure these transactions
as tax deferred exchanges.

Financing Strategies

The
Company’s “Consolidated Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization Ratio” as of
December 31, 2004 is presented in the following table.  The Company calculates the equity component
of its market capitalization as the sum of (i) the total outstanding Common
Shares and assumed conversion of all OP Units at the equivalent market value of
the closing price of the Company’s Common Shares on the New York Stock
Exchange; (ii) the “Common Share Equivalent” of all convertible preferred
shares and preference interests/units; and (iii) the liquidation value of all
perpetual preferred shares and preference interests outstanding.


Capitalization as of
December 31, 2004

Convertible Preferred Shares, Preference Interests

and Junior Preference Units

as of December 31, 2004

The
Company’s policy is to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt-to-total market
capitalization of less than 50% and not incur indebtedness other than
short-term trade, employee compensation or similar indebtedness that will be
paid in the ordinary course of business.

Credit Facilities

In May
2002, the Operating Partnership obtained a three-year $700.0 million unsecured
revolving credit facility maturing May 29, 2005.  Advances under the credit facility bear
interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest periods, plus a
spread dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s credit rating, or based upon
bids received from the lending group.  As
of December 31, 2004, $150.0 million was outstanding and $65.4 million was
restricted (dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for
borrowing) on the credit facility. 
During the year ended December 31, 2004, the weighted average interest
rate on borrowings under the line of credit was 1.73%.

The Operating
Partnership is currently negotiating a new credit facility to replace or expand
its existing facility and fully expects to obtain this at current or improved
terms in March or April 2005.

Business Combinations

In January 2002, the Company sold the former Globe Business Resources,
Inc. (“Globe”) furniture rental business it acquired in July 2000 for
approximately $30.0 million in cash, which approximated the net book value at
the sale date.  The Company has retained
ownership of the former Globe short-term furnished housing business, which is
now known as Equity Corporate Housing (“ECH”).

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company
recorded approximately $17.1 million of asset impairment charges related to
ECH.  Following the guidance in SFAS No.
142, these charges were the result of the Company’s decision to reduce the
carrying value of ECH to $30.0 million, given the weakness in the economy and
management’s expectations for near-term performance and were determined based
upon a discounted cash flow analysis of the business.  This impairment loss is reflected on the
consolidated statements of operations as impairment on corporate housing
business and on the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in goodwill,
net.


Competition

All of
the Company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other
multifamily properties.  The number of
competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material
effect on the Company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any
newly acquired properties and on the rents charged.  The Company may be competing with other
entities that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have more
experience than the Company’s managers. 
In addition, other forms of rental properties and single-family housing
provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily
properties.   Throughout 2003 and 2004,
historically low mortgage interest rates coupled with increased residential
construction and single-family home sales have had an adverse competitive
effect on the Company.

Risk Factors

The following Risk Factors may contain defined terms that are different
from those used in the other sections of this report.  Unless otherwise indicated, when used in this
section, the terms “we” and “us” refer to Equity Residential and its
subsidiaries, including ERP Operating Limited Partnership.

Set forth below are the
risks that we believe are important to investors who purchase or own our common
shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest (which
we refer to collectively as “Shares”); preference interests (“Interests”) of a
subsidiary of ERP Operating Limited Partnership; preference units (“Units”); or
units of limited partnership interest (“OP Units”) of ERP Operating Limited
Partnership, our operating partnership, which are redeemable on a one-for-one
basis for common shares or their cash equivalent.  In this section, we refer to the Shares,
Interests, Units and the OP Units together as our “securities,” and the
investors who own Shares, Interests, Units and/or OP Units as our “security
holders.”

Our Performance and Share
Value are Subject to Risks Associated with the Real
Estate Industry

General

Real property investments
are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid. Several
factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our
properties.  These factors include
changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, local conditions
such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for
our multifamily properties, the attractiveness of our properties to residents,
competition from other available multifamily property owners and changes in
market rental rates.  Our performance
also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for
adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate
taxes, which could increase over time. 
Also, the expenses of owning and operating a property are not
necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition
cause a reduction in income from the property.

We May be Unable to Renew
Leases or Relet Units as Leases Expire

When our residents decide
not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be able to relet their
units.  Even if the residents do renew or
we can relet the units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable
than current lease terms.  Because
virtually all of our leases are for apartments, they are generally for terms of
no more than one year.  If we are unable
to promptly renew the leases or relet the units, or if the rental rates upon
renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our
results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.  Consequently, our cash flow and ability to
service debt and make distributions to security holders would be reduced.


New Acquisitions, Developments and/or Condominium Conversion Projects May
Fail to Perform as Expected and Competition for Acquisitions May Result in
Increased Prices for Properties

We intend to actively
acquire and develop multifamily properties for rental operations and/or
specifically to convert directly into condominiums as well as upgrade and sell
existing properties as individual condominiums. 
We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired or
condominium conversion property up to standards established for its intended
market position or to develop a property. 
Additionally, we expect that other major real estate investors with
significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment
opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our
development efforts.  This competition
may increase prices for multifamily properties or decrease the price we expect
to sell individual condominiums.  We may
not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable
property acquisitions on favorable terms. 
We also plan to develop more properties ourselves over the next few
years in addition to co-investing with our development partners for either the
rental or condominium market, depending on opportunities in each sub-market.  This may increase the overall level of risk
associated with developments.  The total
number of development units, cost of development and estimated completion dates
are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as
the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local government
regulation.

Because Real Estate Investments Are Illiquid, We May Not Be Able To
Sell Properties When Appropriate

Real estate investments
generally cannot be sold quickly.  We may
not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other
conditions.  This inability to respond
promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely
affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our
security holders.

Changes in Laws and
Litigation Risk Could Affect Our Business

We are generally not able to
pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate taxes, income
taxes or other taxes.  Consequently, any
such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our
ability to make distributions to our security holders.  Similarly, changes that increase our
potential liability under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental
compliance would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make
distributions on our securities.

As the largest publicly
traded owner of multifamily properties, we may become involved in legal
proceedings, including but not limited to, consumer, employment, tort and
commercial, that if decided adversely to or settled by us, could result in
liability material to our financial condition or results of operations.

Environmental Problems are
Possible and can be Costly

Federal, state and local
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require
a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean
up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such
property.  The owner or operator may have
to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for
investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with
the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and
liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the
presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been
responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws
may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred.  In addition, third parties may sue the owner
or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental
contamination emanating from that site.

Substantially all of our
properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by
qualified independent environmental consultant companies.  These environmental assessments have not
revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that our management
believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Over the past four years,
there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of
multifamily properties other than the Company alleging personal injury and
property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate.  Some of these lawsuits have resulted in


substantial

monetary judgments or settlements.  Insurance carriers have reacted to these
liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and
pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates.  We have adopted programs designed to minimize
the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for
promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold
might have on residents or the property.

We cannot be assured that
existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental
liabilities, that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a
material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material
environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our
properties.

Insurance Policy Deductibles and Exclusions

In order to partially
mitigate the substantial increase in insurance costs in recent years,
management has determined to gradually increase deductible and self-insured
retention amounts.  As of December 31,
2004, the Company’s property insurance policy (for Wholly Owned Properties)
provides for a per occurrence deductible of $250,000 and self insured retention of $5.0 million per occurrence,
subject to a maximum annual aggregate self insured retention of $7.5
million.  The Company’s liability and
worker’s compensation policies at December 31, 2004, provide for a $1.0 million
per occurrence deductible.  These higher
deductible and self-insured retention amounts do expose the Company to greater
potential uninsured losses, such as the property
damage caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, but management
believes the savings in insurance premium expense justifies this increased
exposure over the long-term.

As a result of the terrorist
attacks of September 11, 2001, property insurance carriers have created exclusions
for losses from terrorism from our “all risk” insurance policies.  While separate terrorism insurance coverage
is available in certain instances, premiums for such coverage are generally
very expensive and deductibles are very high. 
Additionally, the terrorism insurance coverage that is available
typically excludes coverage for losses from nuclear, biological and chemical
attacks.  At the present time, the
Company has determined that it is not economically prudent to obtain property
terrorism insurance for its entire portfolio to the extent otherwise available,
especially given the significant risks that are not covered by such
insurance.  As of December 31, 2004, the
Company’s high-rise properties were insured for $125 million in terrorism
insurance coverage, with a $5 million deductible.  In the event of a terrorist attack impacting
one or more of the properties, we could lose the revenues from the property,
our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from
residents or others suffering injuries or losses.  The Company believes, however, that the
number and geographic diversity of its portfolio and its high-rise terrorism
insurance coverage help to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with
potential terrorist attacks.


Debt Financing, Preferred
Shares and Preference Interests and Units Could Adversely Affect Our
Performance

General

The
Company’s total debt summary, as of December 31, 2004, included:

Debt Summary

* Net of the
  effect of any derivative instruments.

In addition to debt, we have
$842.4 million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of
beneficial interest and preference interests and units, with a weighted average
dividend preference of 8.23% per annum, as of December 31, 2004.  Our use of debt and preferred equity financing
creates certain risks, including the following:

Scheduled Debt Payments
Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition

In the future, our cash flow
could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to
pay distributions on our securities at expected levels.

We may not be able to
refinance existing debt (which in virtually all cases requires substantial
principal payments at maturity) and, if we can, the terms of such refinancing
might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.  If principal payments due at maturity cannot
be refinanced, extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions,
such as new equity capital, our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years
to repay all maturing debt.  As a result,
we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance
of our properties and may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms
that would otherwise be unacceptable to us. 
The Company’s debt maturity schedule as of December 31, 2004 is as
follows:


Debt Maturity
Schedule

(1) Includes $300 million of
unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2015 that is putable/callable
in 2005.

(2) Includes $150 million outstanding
on the Company’s unsecured revolving credit facility.

(3) Includes $150 million of
unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2026 that is putable in 2006.

Financial Covenants Could
Adversely Affect the Company’s Financial Condition

If a property we own is
mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet the
mortgage payments, the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property,
resulting in loss of income and asset value. 
Foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance
existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial
condition and results of operations.

The mortgages on our
properties may contain customary negative covenants that, among other things,
limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage
the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage.  In addition, our unsecured credit facilities
contain certain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on
our ability to incur indebtedness.  The
indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued also
contain certain financial and operating covenants including, among other
things, maintenance of certain financial ratios, as well as limitations on our
ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness (including acquisition
financing), and to sell all or substantially all of our assets.  Our credit facility and indentures are
cross-defaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material
indebtedness.  Our unsecured public debt
covenants as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are (terms are
defined in the indentures):


Unsecured Public Debt Covenants

Some of the properties were
financed with tax-exempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or
deed restrictions.  We have retained an
independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive
covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties.  If these bond compliance requirements
restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to attract low or moderate-income
residents, or eligible/qualified residents, then our income from these
properties may be limited.

Our Degree of Leverage
Could Limit Our Ability to Obtain Additional Financing

Our Consolidated
Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization Ratio was 35% as of December 31, 2004.  We have a policy of incurring indebtedness
for borrowed money only through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries
and only if upon such incurrence our debt to market capitalization ratio would
be approximately 50% or less.  Our degree
of leverage could have important consequences to security holders.  For example, the degree of leverage could
affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working
capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general
corporate purposes, making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the
economy in general.

Rising Interest Rates
Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow

Advances under our credit
facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest
periods, plus a spread dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s credit
rating, or based upon bids received from the lending group.  Certain public issuances of our senior
unsecured debt instruments may also, from time to time, bear interest at
floating rates.  We may also borrow
additional money with variable interest rates in the future.  Increases in interest rates would increase
our interest expenses under these debt instruments and would increase the costs
of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt.  Accordingly, higher interest rates could
adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make
distributions to security holders.


We Depend on Our Key
Personnel

We
depend on the efforts of the Chairman of our Board of Trustees, Samuel Zell,
and our executive officers, particularly Bruce W. Duncan, our President and
Chief Executive Officer and Gerald A. Spector, our Chief Operating Officer.  If they resign, our operations could be
temporarily adversely affected.  Mr. Zell
has entered into executive compensation and retirement benefit agreements with
the Company.  Mr. Duncan and Mr. Spector
have entered into Deferred Compensation Agreements with the Company that under
certain conditions could provide both with a salary benefit after their
respective termination of employment with the Company.  In addition, Mr. Zell and Mr. Spector have
entered into Noncompetition Agreements with the Company and Mr. Duncan’s
Employment Agreement contains covenants not to compete in favor of the Company.

In
the event the Chairman of the Board and/or CEO are unable to serve, (i) the
Lead Trustee shall automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor
to the Chairman, (ii) the Chairman shall automatically be appointed to serve as
the interim successor to the CEO and (iii) the Chair of the Compensation
Committee of the Board will immediately call a meeting of the Committee to
recommend to the full Board the selection of a permanent replacement for either
or both positions, as necessary.

Control and Influence by
Significant Shareholders Could be Exercised in a Manner Adverse to Other
Shareholders

As
of December 31, 2004, Samuel Zell, the Chairman of the Board of the Company,
and certain of the current holders of OP Units issued to affiliates of Mr. Zell,
and our executive officers and trustees, owned some of our common shares.  In addition, the consent of certain
affiliates of Mr. Zell is required for certain amendments to the Fifth Amended
and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of ERP Operating Limited
Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”). 
As a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments
to the Partnership Agreement, the Zell affiliates may have influence over the
Company.  Although these security holders
have not agreed to act together on any matter, they would be in a position to
exercise even more influence over the Company’s affairs if they were to act
together in the future.  This influence
could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the
interests of other security holders.  For
additional information regarding the security ownership of Mr. Zell and our
executive officers and trustees, see the Company’s definitive proxy statement.

Shareholders’ Ability to
Effect Changes in Control of the Company is Limited

Provisions
of Our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws Could Inhibit Changes in Control

Certain
provisions of our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws may delay or prevent a change
in control of the Company or other transactions that could provide the security
holders with a premium over the then-prevailing market price of their
securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security
holders.  This includes the 5% Ownership
Limit described below.  See “We Have a
Share Ownership Limit for REIT Tax Purposes.” 
Also, any future series of preferred shares of beneficial interest may
have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control
or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security
holders.

We Have
a Share Ownership Limit for REIT Tax Purposes

To
remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50%
in value of our outstanding Shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by
five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year.  To facilitate maintenance of our REIT
qualification, our Declaration of Trust, subject to certain exceptions,
prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5% of the lesser of
the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred
shares.  We refer to this restriction as
the “Ownership Limit.”  Absent any
exemption or waiver granted by our Board of Trustees, securities acquired or
held in violation of the Ownership Limit will be transferred to a trust for the
exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the security
holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate.  A transfer of Shares may be void if it causes
a person to violate the Ownership Limit. 
The Ownership Limit could delay or prevent a change in control and,
therefore, could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a
premium over the then-prevailing market price for their Shares.  To reduce the ability of the Board to use the
Ownership Limit as an anti-takeover device, on May 28, 2004 the Company amended
the Ownership Limit to require, rather than permit, the Board to grant a waiver
of the


Ownership Limit if the individual seeking a
waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the Company’s
status as a REIT.

Our
Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest May Affect Changes in Control

Our
Declaration of Trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to issue up to 100
million preferred shares of beneficial interest, and to establish the
preferences and rights (including the right to vote and the right to convert
into common shares) of any preferred shares issued.  The Board of Trustees may use its powers to
issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or
prevent a change in control of the Company, even if a change in control were in
the interest of security holders.  As of
December 31, 2004, 4,108,658 preferred shares were issued and outstanding.

Inapplicability
of Maryland Law Limiting Certain Changes in Control

Certain
provisions of Maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit
“business combinations” (including certain issuances of equity securities) with
any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of
outstanding securities, or with an affiliate who, at any time within the
two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten
percent or more of the voting power of the trust’s outstanding voting
securities (an “Interested Shareholder”), or with an affiliate of an Interested
Shareholder.  These prohibitions last for
five years after the most recent date on which the Interested Shareholder
became an Interested Shareholder.  After
the five-year period, a business combination with an Interested Shareholder
must be approved by two super-majority shareholder votes unless, among other
conditions, holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares
and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously
paid by the Interested Shareholder for its common shares.  As permitted by Maryland law, however, the
Board of Trustees of the Company has opted out of these restrictions with
respect to any business combination involving the Zell Original Owners and
persons acting in concert with any of the Zell Original Owners.  Consequently, the five-year prohibition and
the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination
involving us and/or any of them.  Such
business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders.

Our Success as a REIT is
Dependent on Compliance with Federal Income Tax Requirements

Our
Failure to Qualify as a REIT Would Have Serious Adverse Consequences to Our
Security Holders

We
believe that we have qualified for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes since our taxable year ended December 31, 1992 based, in part,
upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities
or engaged in significant merger transactions. 
We plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a
REIT.  Many of these requirements, however,
are highly technical and complex.  We
cannot, therefore, guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the
future as a REIT.  The determination that
we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be
totally within our control.  For example,
to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from sources
that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. 
We are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90% of
our REIT taxable income excluding capital gains.  The fact that we hold our assets through ERP
Operating Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the
application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake
could jeopardize our REIT status. 
Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and
regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more
difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a REIT.  We do not believe, however, that any pending
or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our REIT status.

If
we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax at
regular corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS granted us relief under certain
statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years
following the year we first failed to qualify. 
If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would have to pay significant income
taxes.  We, therefore, would have less
money available for


investments

or for distributions to security
holders.  This would likely have a
significant adverse affect on the value of our securities.  In addition, we would no longer be required
to make any distributions to security holders.

We
could be Disqualified as a REIT or Have to Pay Taxes if Our Merger Partners Did
Not Qualify as REITs

If
any of our recent merger partners had failed to qualify as a REIT throughout
the duration of their existence, then they might have had undistributed “C
corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us.  If that was the case and we did not
distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the
merger took place, we might not qualify as a REIT.  We believe based, in part, upon opinions of
legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well
as our own investigations, among other things, that each of our merger partners
qualified as a REIT and that, in any event, none of them had any undistributed “C
corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us.  If any of our merger partners failed to
qualify as a REIT, an additional concern would be that they would have
recognized taxable gain at the time they were merged with us.  We would be liable for the tax on such
gain.  In this event, we would have to
pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable
merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years
of the merger. Finally, we could be precluded from electing REIT status for up
to four years after the year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify
for REIT status.

Other
Tax Liabilities

Even
if we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to certain federal, state and local
taxes on our income and property.  In
addition, our third-party management operations, corporate housing business and
condominium conversion business, which are conducted through subsidiaries,
generally will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.

Compliance with REIT
Distribution Requirements May Affect Our Financial Condition

Distribution Requirements May
Increase the Indebtedness of the Company

We
may be required from time to time, under certain circumstances, to accrue as
income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received.  In such event, or upon our repayment of
principal on debt, we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to
enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a REIT.  Accordingly, we could be required to borrow
funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these
distribution requirements.

Federal Income Tax
Considerations

General

The
following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material
to a holder of common shares.  It is not
exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. For example, it does not give a
detailed discussion of any state, local or foreign tax considerations. The
following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant
to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances.  Moreover, it does not address all tax matters
that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under
the tax laws, such as insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial
institutions or broker-dealers, foreign corporations and persons who are not
citizens or residents of the United States.

The
specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material
impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase, ownership and
disposition of common shares. Therefore, it is essential that each prospective
shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the


application

of the federal income tax laws to the
shareholder’s personal tax situation, as well as any tax consequences arising
under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

The
information in this section is based on the current Internal Revenue Code,
current, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations, the legislative history
of the Internal Revenue Code, current administrative interpretations and
practices of the Internal Revenue Service, including its practices and policies
as set forth in private letter rulings, which are not binding on the Internal
Revenue Service, and existing court decisions. 
Future legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations and
court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations
of current law.  Any change could apply
retroactively.  Thus, it is possible that
the Internal Revenue Service could challenge the statements in this discussion,
which do not bind the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and that a court
could agree with the Internal Revenue Service.

Our Taxation

We
elected REIT status beginning with the year that ended December 31, 1992.  In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, we
generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT
taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders.  This treatment substantially eliminates the
double taxation that applies to most corporations, which pay a tax on their
income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on
the amount they receive.

We
will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our REIT
taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders.
In addition, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax if we do not satisfy
specific REIT distribution requirements. 
We could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items
of tax preference.  In addition, any net
income from “prohibited transactions” (i.e., dispositions of property, other
than property held by a taxable REIT subsidiary, held primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of business) will be subject to a 100%
tax.  We could also be subject to a 100%
penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted
by a taxable REIT subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the
Internal Revenue Service.   If we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income
test or the 95% gross income test (described below) but have maintained our
qualification as a REIT because we satisfied certain other requirements, we
will still generally be subject to a 100% penalty tax on the amount by which we
fail such gross income test.  If we fail
to satisfy any of the REIT asset tests (described below) by more than a

de minimis

amount, due to reasonable cause, and we
nonetheless maintain our REIT qualification because of specified cure
provisions, we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or
the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the
nonqualifying assets (this relief provision is generally applicable only for
our taxable years commencing on or after January 1, 2005).  If we fail to satisfy any provision of the
Internal Revenue Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT
(other than a violation of the REIT gross income or asset tests described
below) and the violation is due to reasonable cause, we may retain our REIT
qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such
failure (this relief provision is generally applicable only for our taxable
years commencing on or after January 1, 2005). 
Moreover, we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on
certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate.

We
believe that we have qualified as a REIT for all of our taxable years beginning
with 1992. We also believe that our current structure and method of operation
is such that we will continue to qualify as a REIT.  However, given the complexity of the REIT
qualification requirements, we cannot provide any assurance that the actual
results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under
the Internal Revenue Code for a particular year.

If
we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and the relief
provisions described herein do not apply, we will be subject to tax on our
taxable income at regular corporate rates. 
We also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax.” As a
result, our failure to qualify as a REIT would significantly reduce the cash we
have available to distribute to our shareholders.  Unless entitled to statutory relief, we would
be disqualified as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during
which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether we would be
entitled to statutory relief.


Our
qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our ability to satisfy various
requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. 
We are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis
through actual annual operating and other results.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that
we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as
a REIT.

Share
Ownership Test and Organizational Requirement

.

In order to qualify
as a REIT, our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100
persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months, or during a
proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months.  Also, not more than 50% in value of our
shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying
certain constructive ownership rules, by five or fewer individuals during the
last half of each taxable year.  In
addition, we must meet certain other organizational requirements, including,
but not limited to, that (i) the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by
transferable shares and (ii) we are managed by one or more trustees.  We believe that we have satisfied all of
these tests and all other organizational requirements and that
we will continue to do so in the future. 
In order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50% share
ownership test discussed above, we have placed certain restrictions on the
transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of
share ownership.  However, such
restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements, and thereby
failing to qualify as a REIT.

Gross Income Tests

.  To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two
gross income tests.  First, at least 75%
of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived directly or
indirectly from rents from real property, investments in real estate and/or
real estate mortgages, dividends paid by another REIT and from some types of
temporary investments.  Second, at least
95% of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from any
combination of income qualifying under the 75% test and dividends, non-real
estate mortgage interest, some payments under hedging instruments and gain from
the sale or disposition of stock or securities. 
To qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the
gross income tests, rental payments must generally be received from unrelated
persons and not be based on the net income of the resident.  Also, the rent attributable to personal
property must not exceed 15% of the total rent. 
We may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our
rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in
connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible
services”.  If such services are
impermissible, then we may generally provide them only if they are considered
de minimis in amount, or are provided through an independent contractor from
whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements, or through a
taxable REIT subsidiary.  We believe that
services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered
in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered
impermissible, or, if considered impermissible services, will meet the de
minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable REIT
subsidiary.  However, we cannot provide
any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with these
positions.

If we fail to satisfy one
or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless
qualify as a REIT for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code.  In this
case, a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above.  Generally, it is not possible to state
whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these
relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply, we
will not qualify as a REIT.

Asset Tests

.  In
general, at the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must satisfy four
tests relating to the nature of our assets: 
(1) at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by
real estate assets (which include for this purpose shares in other real estate
investment trusts) and certain cash related items; (2) not more than 25% of our
total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75% asset
class; (3) except for equity investments in other REITs, qualified REIT
subsidiaries (i.e., corporations owned 100% by a REIT that are not TRSs or
REITs), or taxable REIT subsidiaries: (a) the value of any one issuer’s
securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets and
(b) we may not own more than 10% of the value of or the voting securities
of any one issuer; and (4) not more than 20% of our total assets may be
represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries.  Securities for purposes of the asset tests
described in (3) above may include debt securities other than those qualifying
as "straight debt".  We
currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be
taxed as REITs for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly
traded.  If any such entity were to fail
to qualify as a REIT, we would not meet the


10% voting stock limitation and the 10% value
limitation and we would fail to qualify as a REIT.  We believe that we and each of the REITs we
own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for REIT
qualification.  However, we cannot
provide any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service might not disagree with
our determinations.

For taxable years commencing
on or after January 1, 2005, if we fail to satisfy the 5% or 10% asset tests
described above after a 30-day cure period provided in the Internal Revenue
Code, we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our
non-qualifying assets is

de minimis

(i.e., does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the total value of our assets at the
end of the applicable quarter or $10,000,000) and we dispose of the
non-qualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in
which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered.  For violations due to reasonable cause and
not willful neglect that are in excess of the

de minimis

exception described above, we may avoid disqualification as a REIT under any of
the asset tests, after the 30-day cure period, by disposing of sufficient
assets to meet the asset test within such six month period, paying a tax equal
to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the
net income generated by the non-qualifying assets and disclosing certain
information to the Internal Revenue Service. 
If we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions, or if we fail
to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests, we would cease to qualify
as a REIT.

Annual Distribution Requirements

.  To qualify as a REIT, we are
generally required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends,
to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90% of our REIT
taxable income.  These distributions must
be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following
taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior
year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the
declaration is made.  We intend to make
timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution
requirements.  To the extent that we do
not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less
than 100% of our REIT taxable income, as adjusted, we are subject to tax on
these amounts at regular corporate rates.  
We will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of the required
distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained
for which federal income tax was paid, if we fail to distribute during each
calendar year at least the sum of:  (1)
85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year; (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain
net income for the year; and (3) any undistributed taxable income from prior
taxable years.  A REIT may elect to
retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net
capital gains and pay the tax on the gains.  In that case, a REIT may elect to have its
shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital
gains in income as long-term capital gains and receive a credit for their share
of the tax paid by the REIT.  For
purposes of the 4% excise tax described above, any retained amounts would be
treated as having been distributed.

Ownership
of Partnership Interests By Us

.  As a
result of our ownership of the Operating Partnership, we will be considered to
own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the
Operating Partnership, respectively, for purposes of the REIT asset and income
tests, including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries
that are partnerships or limited liability companies.

Ownership
of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries By Us

.  The Internal Revenue Code
provides that for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, REITs may
own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of
"taxable REIT subsidiaries" or "TRSs", which are
corporations subject to tax as a regular "C" corporation that have
elected, jointly with a REIT, to be a TRS. 
Generally, a taxable REIT subsidiary may own assets that cannot
otherwise be owned by a REIT and can perform impermissible tenant services
(discussed above), which would otherwise taint our rental income under the REIT
income tests.  In certain circumstances,
assets owned by us are sold to our TRSs. 
In any such sale, the price paid by the TRS to us is determined on an
arms length basis and is supported by third party valuation reports.  In enacting the taxable REIT subsidiary
rules, Congress intended that the arrangements between a REIT and its taxable
REIT subsidiaries be structured to ensure that a taxable REIT subsidiary will
be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation.  As a result, the Internal Revenue Code imposes
certain limits on the ability of a taxable REIT subsidiary to deduct interest
payments made to us.  In addition as
discussed above, we will be obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on some
payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our TRSs if the economic
arrangements between us, our tenants and the TRS are not comparable to similar
arrangements among unrelated parties.

Our Management Company and Other Subsidiaries

.  A small portion of the cash to
be used by the Operating Partnership to fund distributions to us is expected to
come from payments of dividends from management companies and other
subsidiaries of the Company that have elected TRS status.  These companies pay federal and state income
tax at the full applicable corporate rates. 
They will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes, but we cannot
guarantee whether or the extent to which, measures taken to minimize these
taxes will be successful.  To the extent
that these companies are required to pay taxes, the cash available for distribution
from these management companies by us to shareholders will be reduced
accordingly.

State and Local Taxes

.  We may be subject to state or local taxation
in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business or
reside.  Our state and local tax
treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed
above.  Consequently, prospective
shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of
state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares.

Taxation of Domestic Shareholders Subject to U.S. Tax

General

.  If we
qualify as a REIT, distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with
respect to their common shares, other than capital gain distributions and
distributions attributable to taxable REIT subsidiaries, will be treated as
ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and
profits.  These distributions will not be
eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are
corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the
Internal Revenue Code, meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal
rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates
applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy
applicable holding period requirements. 
In determining whether


distributions

are out of earnings and profits, we will
allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the
common shares.  The portion of ordinary
dividends, made after December 31, 2002, which represent ordinary dividends we
receive from a TRS, will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to REIT
shareholders and are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our
non-corporate shareholders.

To
the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess
of our earnings and profits, such distributions will be considered a return of
capital.  Such distributions will be
treated as a tax-free distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a
shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated. To
the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic
shareholder’s tax basis; such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale
of shares.  Shareholders may not include
in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or
capital losses.

Distributions
made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable
to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital
asset held for more than one year.  This
treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not
exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year.  It applies regardless of the period for which
a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares.  Despite this general rule, corporate shareholders
may be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as
ordinary income.

Generally,
we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a 15%
rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured Section
1250 gain distribution.   A 15% rate gain
distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are
individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 15%.  An unrecaptured Section 1250 gain
distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are
individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25%.

If,
for any taxable year, we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any
portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all
classes of shares of beneficial interest, then the portion of the capital gains
dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the
total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction.  The numerator of the fraction will be the
total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for
the year.  The denominator of the
fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all
classes of shares of beneficial interest.

We may elect to retain
(rather than distribute as is generally required) net capital gain for a
taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain.  If we make this election, shareholders must
include in income, as long-term capital gain, their proportionate share of the
undistributed net capital gain. 
Shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of
the tax paid by us on these gains. 
Accordingly, they will receive a tax credit or refund for the
amount.  Shareholders will increase the
basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital
gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as
having paid.  Our earnings and profits
will be adjusted appropriately.

In
general, a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal
to the difference between:

(a)

the amount of cash and the fair market value of
any property received in the sale or other disposition; and

(b)

the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the
common shares.

The
gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a
capital asset.  Generally, the capital
gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the common shares were
held for more than one year.

In
general, a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that
were held for six months or less, determined after applying certain holding
period rules, will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that the
shareholder received distributions that were treated as long-term capital
gains.  For shareholders who are
individuals, trusts and estates, the long-term capital loss will be apportioned
among the applicable long-term capital gain rates to the extent that
distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated.


Taxation of Domestic Tax-Exempt Shareholders

Most
tax-exempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the
extent of their unrelated business taxable income, which is often referred to
as UBTI.  Unless a tax-exempt shareholder
holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in
an unrelated trade or business, distributions to the shareholder should not
constitute UBTI.  Similarly, if a
tax-exempt shareholder sells common shares, the income from the sale should not
constitute UBTI unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed
property or used the shares in a trade or business.

However,
for tax-exempt shareholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations,
supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified group legal services
plans, income from owning or selling common shares will constitute UBTI unless
the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in
reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common
shares.  These shareholders should
consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve
requirements which are set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.

In
addition, certain pension trusts that own more than 10% of a “pension-held REIT”
must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the REIT as
UBTI.  We have not been and do not expect
to be treated as a pension-held REIT for purposes of this rule.

Taxation of Foreign Shareholders

The
following is a discussion of certain anticipated United States federal income
tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable
to a foreign shareholder.  For purposes
of this discussion, a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than:

(a)

a citizen or resident of the United States;

(b)

a corporation or partnership created or
organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States or of any
state thereof; or

(c)

an estate or trust whose income is includable
in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its
source.

Distributions by Us

.  Distributions by us to a foreign shareholder
that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of United States
real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be
treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of
our earnings and profits.  These
distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of United States
federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30% rate, or a lower treaty rate,
unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by
the foreign shareholder of a United States trade or business.  Please note that under certain treaties lower
withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends
from REITs.  Dividends that are
effectively connected with a United States trade or business will be subject to
tax on a net basis at graduated rates, and are generally not subject to
withholding.  Certification and
disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from
withholding under this exemption.  A
foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional
branch profits tax at a 30% rate or a lower treaty rate.


We
expect to withhold United States income tax at the rate of 30% on any
distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless:

(a)

a lower treaty rate applies and any required
form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed
with us; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder files an IRS Form W-8ECI
with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income.

A
distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will
not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution
does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares.  Instead, the distribution will reduce the adjusted
basis of the common shares.  To the
extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares,
it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common
shares.  The tax treatment of this gain
is described below.

We
intend to withhold at a rate of 30%, or a lower applicable treaty rate, on the
entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain
distribution.  In such event, a foreign
shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the IRS if it
subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in excess of our
earnings and profits, and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s
United States tax liability with respect to the distribution.

Distributions
to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as
capital gain dividends, other than those arising from the disposition of a
United States real property interest, generally will not be subject to United
States federal income taxation unless:

(a)

the investment in the common shares is
effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s United States trade or
business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same
treatment as domestic shareholders, except that a shareholder that is a foreign
corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax, as discussed above;
or

(b)

the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien
individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the
taxable year and has a “tax home” in the United States, in which case the
nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual’s
capital gains.

Under
the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, which is known as FIRPTA,
distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales
or exchanges of United States real property interests will cause the foreign
shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively
connected with a United States trade or business. This rule applies whether or
not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend.  Accordingly, foreign shareholders generally
would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to U.S.
shareholders, subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of
nonresident alien individuals.  In
addition, a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch
profits tax discussed above.  We are
required to withhold 35% of these distributions.  The withheld amount can be credited against
the foreign shareholder’s United States federal income tax liability.

Although
the law is not entirely clear on the matter, it appears that amounts we
designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held
by U.S. shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in
the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends. Under that
approach, foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against the
United States


federal

income tax liability their proportionate
share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains.  In addition, foreign shareholders would be
able to receive from the IRS a refund to the extent their proportionate share
of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual United States federal income
tax liability.

Foreign
Shareholders' Sales of Common Shares

.

Gain recognized by
a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will
not be subject to United States taxation unless the shares constitute a “United
States real property interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA.  The common shares will not constitute a
United States real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled
REIT.  A domestically controlled REIT is
a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in
value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders.  We believe that we are a domestically
controlled REIT.  Therefore, we believe
that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under
FIRPTA.  However, because common shares
and preferred shares are publicly traded, we cannot guarantee that we will
continue to be a domestically controlled REIT. 
In any event, gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not
otherwise subject to FIRPTA will be subject to U.S. tax, if either:

(a)

the investment in the common shares is
effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s United States trade or
business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same
treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien
individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the
taxable year and has a tax home in the United States, in which case the
nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual’s
capital gains.

Even
if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled REIT, gain
arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares
still would not be subject to United States taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of
a United States real property interest if:

(a)

the class or series of shares being sold is “regularly
traded,” as defined by applicable IRS regulations, on an established securities
market such as the New York Stock Exchange; and

(b)

the selling foreign shareholder owned 5% or less
of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout
the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange.

If
gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under
FIRPTA, the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular United States
income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable U.S.
shareholder, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax, a special
alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the
possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign
corporations.  The purchaser of the
common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 10% of the
purchase price.

Information Reporting Requirement and Backup Withholding

We
will report to our domestic shareholders and the Internal Revenue Service the
amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax
withheld, if any.  Under certain
circumstances, domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding.  Backup withholding will apply only if such
domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the Internal
Revenue Service.  Backup withholding will
not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as
corporations and tax-exempt organizations. 
Domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding
their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for
obtaining such an exemption.  Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. 
Rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment
to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person's
United States federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a
refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue
Service.

The Properties

As of December 31, 2004,
the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding
entities, owned all or a portion of 939 properties in 32 states and the
District of Columbia consisting of 200,149 units.  The Company’s properties are more fully
described as follows:

Resident leases are
generally for twelve months in length and typically require security
deposits.  The garden-style properties are
generally defined as properties with two and/or three story buildings while the
mid-rise/high-rise are defined as properties with greater than three story
buildings.  These two property types
typically provide residents with amenities, which may include a clubhouse,
swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television access. Certain of these
properties offer additional amenities such as saunas, whirlpools, spas, sports
courts and exercise rooms or other amenities. 
The ranch-style properties are defined as single story properties, which
do not provide additional amenities for residents other than laundry facilities
and cable television access.  The
military housing properties are defined as those properties located on military
bases.

It
is management’s role to monitor compliance with property policies and to
provide preventive maintenance of the properties including common areas,
facilities and amenities.  The Company
has a dedicated training and education department that creates and coordinates
training and strategic implementation for the Company’s property management
personnel.  The Company believes that,
due in part to its emphasis on training and employee quality, the properties
historically have had high occupancy rates.

The
distribution of the properties throughout the United States reflects the
Company’s belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio
from regional and economic influences. 
At the same time, the Company has sought to create clusters of
properties within each of its primary markets in order to achieve economies of
scale in management and operation.  The
Company may nevertheless acquire additional multifamily properties located
anywhere in the continental United States.

The following tables set
forth certain information by type and state relating to the Company’s
properties (includes development and condominium conversion properties) at
December 31, 2004:


GARDEN-STYLE PROPERTIES


MID-RISE/HIGH RISE PROPERTIES

RANCH-STYLE PROPERTIES

million has been transferred to land and depreciable property and $169.2
million is currently reflected as construction in progress (“CIP”). The
remaining $148.7 million of CIP represents land held for future development and
related costs.  Of the $162.6 million
remaining to be invested, $107.6 million will be funded through third party
construction mortgages.

Legal Proceedings

In
August 2004, the Company tried a class action lawsuit in Palm Beach County,
Florida regarding certain charges made to residents who terminated their leases
early or failed to provide sufficient notice of intent to vacate.  In December 2004, the Court issued a Findings
of Fact and Conclusions of Law holding those fees legally uncollectible under
Florida law. In recognition of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,
which awarded damages and interest to the class in the amount of approximately
$1.6 million, the Company established a reserve of approximately $1.6 million and
correspondingly recorded this as a general and administrative expense. Due to
pending appeals, the award is neither final nor enforceable.  Accordingly, it is not possible to determine
or predict the ultimate outcome of the case. 
While no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe that this
lawsuit, if the ultimate outcome is unfavorable, will have a material adverse
effect on the Company.

The
Company does not believe there is any other litigation pending or threatened
against the Company which, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably may be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Selected Financial Data

The following
table sets forth selected financial and operating information on a historical
basis for the Company.  The following
information should be read in conjunction with all of the financial statements
and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  The historical operating and balance sheet
data have been derived from the historical financial statements of the Company.  All amounts have also been restated in
accordance with the discontinued operations provisions of SFAS No. 144.  Certain capitalized terms as used herein are
defined in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


CONSOLIDATED
HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

(Financial
information in thousands except for per share and property data)

(1)

The
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds
from operations (“FFO”) (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States (“GAAP”)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable
property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be
calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002
White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO
for previously depreciated operating properties only.  Once the Company commences the conversion of
units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such
property.  See Item 7 for a
reconciliation of net income to FFO.

(2)

The
Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of
the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized
measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or
losses related


to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation
(which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on
historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the
operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared
to different companies.  FFO in and of
itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating
activities in accordance with GAAP. 
Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to
net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP
or as a measure of liquidity.  The
Company’s calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due
to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital
expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate
companies.

Item 7

.  Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The following discussion and
analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company
should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
Notes thereto. Due to the Company’s ability to control the Operating
Partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning interests in the
Unconsolidated Properties and certain other entities in which the Company has
investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been
consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.  Capitalized terms used herein and not defined
are as defined elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2004.

Forward-looking statements
in this Item 7 as well as Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are
intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
The words “believes”, “estimates”, “expects” and “anticipates” and other
similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and
trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters identify
forward-looking statements.  Such
forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could
cause actual results, performance, or achievements of the Company to differ
materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Factors that might cause such differences
include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

The total number of development units, cost
of development and completion dates as well as anticipated capital expenditures
for replacements and building improvements all reflect the Company’s best
estimates and are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic
conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition
and local government regulation;

•

Sources of capital to the Company or labor
and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or
development are more expensive than anticipated;

•

Occupancy levels and market rents may be
adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions
including, without limitation, new construction of multifamily housing, slow
employment growth, availability of low interest mortgages for single-family
home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are
beyond the Company’s control; and

•

Additional factors as discussed in Part I of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly those under “Risk Factors”.

Readers are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as
of the date hereof.  The Company
undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these
forward-looking statements, which may be made to reflect events or
circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events.  Forward-looking
statements and related uncertainties are also included in Note 5 and 11 to the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.


Results of Operations

The following table
summarizes the number of properties and related units for the periods
presented:

The Company’s
primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is
net operating income (“NOI”).  The
Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of
the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct
measure of the actual operating results of the Company’s apartment communities.

Properties that the Company owned for all of both
2004 and 2003 (the “2004 Same Store Properties”), which represented 162,201
units, impacted the Company’s results of operations.  Properties that the Company owned for all of
both 2003 and 2002 (the “2003 Same Store Properties”), which represented
171,841 units, also impacted the Company’s results of operations.  Both the 2004 Same Store Properties and 2003
Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs.

The Company’s acquisition, disposition,
completed development and consolidation of previously unconsolidated property
and variable interest entity activities also impacted overall results of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.  The impacts of these activities are also
discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.

Comparison of the year ended December 31,
2004 to the year ended December 31, 2003

For the year ended December 31,
2004, income from continuing operations decreased by approximately $22.6
million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2003.  During the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Company established a reserve and recorded a corresponding expense of $15.2
million in estimated uninsured property damage at certain of its properties
primarily located in Florida caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and
Jeanne.  Of this amount, approximately
$9.4 million had been spent for hurricane related repairs through December 31,
2004.


Revenues from
the 2004 Same Store Properties increased $14.1 million primarily as a result of
lower concessions provided residents and a slight increase in occupancy
rates.  Expenses from the 2004 Same Store
Properties increased $22.5 million primarily due to higher payroll, utility
costs and real estate taxes.  The
following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, NOI and weighted average
occupancy for the 2004 Same Store Properties:

The following
table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated
statements of operations to NOI for the 2004 Same Store Properties.

For properties
that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2004 and expects to continue
to own through December 31, 2005, the Company anticipates the following
same store results for the full year ending December 31, 2005:


2005 Same-Store Assumptions

These 2005
assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.

Rental income
from properties other than 2004 Same Store Properties increased by
approximately $172.6 million primarily as a result of revenue from newly
acquired properties not yet included as 2004 Same Store Properties and the
consolidation of all previously unconsolidated development projects.

Fee and asset management
revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, decreased by $3.9 million
primarily as a result of lower income earned from Ft. Lewis and managing fewer
properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities.  As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
Company managed 17,988 units and
18,475 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities.

Property
management expenses include off-site expenses associated with the
self-management of the Company’s properties as well as management fees paid to
any third party management companies. 
These expenses increased by approximately $7.8 million or 11.5%.  This increase is primarily attributable to
higher payroll costs, including bonuses and long-term compensation costs as
well as severance costs for certain employees. 
In addition, the property management company experienced slightly higher
costs for travel, temporary help, internal conferences and legal and
professional fees.

Depreciation expense, which
includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased $69.2 million
primarily as a result of the consolidation of previously unconsolidated
projects and properties acquired after December 31, 2003, many of which
had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously
acquired, and also due to additional depreciation on capital expenditures for
all properties owned.

General and administrative
expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately
$12.4 million or 32.0% between the periods under comparison.  This increase was primarily due to the costs
of consulting services rendered to increase operating efficiencies and
increased litigation and internal control costs.  This increase was partially offset by $1.4
million of immediate expense recognition related to options granted in the
first quarter of 2003 to the Company’s former chief executive officer.   Consulting services were contracted to
enhance resident satisfaction/retention, unit pricing and expense
procurement/reduction.  The Company
believes that these additional expenditures may be more than offset by
increased rental revenues and/or reduced operating expenses in future
years.  The Company also anticipates that
general and administrative expenses will approximate $43.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2005.  The above
assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.

The Company recorded impairment
charges on its technology investments of approximately $1.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003.  See
Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion.

Interest and
other income decreased approximately $5.5 million, primarily as a result of
lower balances available for investments including deposits in tax deferred
exchange accounts and collateral agreements related to development projects.

Interest expense, including amortization
of deferred financing costs, increased approximately $20.8 million.  This increase was primarily attributable to
increases in mortgage and unsecured note balances and lower capitalized
interest.  During the year ended December 31,
2004, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $14.0 million as
compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.  This capitalization of interest primarily
related to equity investments in Partially Owned Properties (consolidated)


engaged in development activities.  The effective interest cost on all
indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 5.87% as compared to
6.36% for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Loss from investments in
unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $2.8 million between the
periods under comparison.  This decrease
is primarily the result of consolidation of properties that were previously
unconsolidated, partially offset by an increase in realized losses on the
settlement of derivative instruments.

Net gain on sales of
discontinued operations increased approximately $13.2 million between the
periods under comparison.  This increase
is primarily the result of an increase in the number of condominium units sold.

Discontinued operations, net,
decreased approximately $41.6 million between the periods under
comparison.  See Note 13 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Comparison of the year ended December 31,
2003 to the year ended December 31, 2002

For the year ended December 31,
2003, income from continuing operations decreased by approximately $30.2
million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2002.  This decrease was primarily attributable to
increased operating expenses incurred including property management costs and
depreciation.

Revenues from
the 2003 Same Store Properties decreased by $38.2 million primarily as a result
of lower overall physical occupancy, increased concessions and lower rental
rates charged to both new and renewal residents.  Property operating expenses from the 2003
Same Store Properties increased by $36.3 million primarily due to higher
payroll, maintenance, utility, real estate taxes, insurance, leasing and
advertising and building costs.  The
following tables provide comparative revenue, expense, NOI and weighted average
occupancy for the 2003 Same Store Properties:

Rental income
from properties other than 2003 Same Store Properties increased by

acquired properties not yet included as 2003 Same Store Properties and
additional Partially Owned Properties consolidated in the fourth quarter of
2002 and during the year ended December 31, 2003.

Fee and asset management
revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased by $4.9 million
primarily as a result of additional income allocated from Ft. Lewis.  As of December 31, 2003 and


2002, the Company managed 18,475 units and 18,965 units, respectively,
for third parties and unconsolidated entities.

Property
management expenses include off-site expenses associated with the
self-management of the Company’s properties as well as management fees paid to
any third party management companies. 
These expenses decreased by approximately $4.4 million or 6.0%.  This decrease is primarily attributable to a
reversal of a profit sharing accrual in the first quarter of 2003 related to
the 2002 calendar year as the Company didn’t achieve its stated goals and
management elected not to make a discretionary contribution to the plan.  In addition, the Company recorded lower
expense in connection with granting less restricted shares and reducing the
expense associated with the Company’s matched funding of its 401(k) plan during
2003 and not incurring an expense for 2003 discretionary profit sharing
contributions.

Depreciation expense, which
includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased $25.4 million
primarily as a result of properties acquired after December 31, 2002, many
of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties
previously acquired, and additional depreciation on capital expenditures for
all properties owned.

General and administrative
expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately
$7.7 million between the periods under comparison.  This decrease was primarily due to lower
expenses recorded in connection with granting less restricted shares to
employees during 2003, partially offset by approximately a $2.6 million
increase related to the Company’s decision to begin to expense its stock based
compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No.
148).  In addition, lower state income
and franchise taxes also contributed to this decrease.

The Company recorded impairment
charges on its technology investments and its corporate housing business of
approximately $1.2 million and $18.3 million for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.  See Note 19
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Interest and
other income increased by approximately $1.4 million, primarily as a result of
higher cash balances available for short-term investments throughout 2003.

Interest expense, including
amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $4.6 million primarily due to lower
variable interest rates and lower overall levels of debt.  During the year ended December 31, 2003,
the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $20.6 million as
compared to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.  This capitalization of interest primarily
related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in development
activities.  The effective interest cost
on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 6.36% as
compared to 6.54% for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Loss from investments in
unconsolidated entities increased approximately $6.4 million between the
periods under comparison.  This increase
is primarily the result of increased operating losses from equity investments
partially offset by unrealized gains on derivative instruments.

Net gain on sales of
discontinued operations increased approximately $206.4 million between the
periods under comparison.  This increase
is primarily the result of a greater number of properties sold during the year
ended December 31, 2003, as well as the fact that several properties had
lower net carrying values at sale.

Discontinued
operations, net, decreased approximately $53.6 million between the periods
under comparison.  See Note 13 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.


Liquidity
and Capital Resources

For the Year Ended December 31, 2004

As of January 1, 2004, the Company had
approximately $49.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $633.3 million
available under its line of credit (net of $56.7 million which was
restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for

prior to consolidation); and

•

Acquire the
minority interests in fifteen previously unconsolidated development properties,
two vacant land parcels and four other properties for $53.4 million in cash
(prior to consideration of cash acquired of $4.2 million).

Depending on
its analysis of market prices, economic conditions, and other opportunities for
the investment of available capital, the Company may repurchase up to an
additional $85.0 million of its Common Shares pursuant to its existing share
buyback program authorized by the Board of Trustees.  The Company did not repurchase any of its
Common Shares during the year ended December 31, 2004.

The Company’s
total debt summary and debt maturity schedule as of December 31, 2004, are as
follows:


* Net of the effect of any derivative
instruments.

Debt Maturity Schedule

(1) Includes $300 million of unsecured debt
with a final maturity of 2015 that is putable/callable in 2005.

(2) Includes $150 million outstanding on the
Company’s unsecured revolving credit facility.

(3) Includes $150 million of unsecured debt
with a final maturity of 2026 that is putable in 2006.

In June 2003, the Operating Partnership filed and the SEC declared
effective a Form S-3 registration statement to register $2.0 billion of debt
securities.  In addition, the Operating
Partnership carried over $280.0 million related to a prior registration
statement.  As of February 2, 2005, $1.48
billion in debt securities remained available for issuance under this
registration statement.

In February 1998, the Company filed and the SEC declared effective a
Form S-3 Registration Statement to register $1.0 billion of equity
securities.  In addition, the Company
carried over $272.4 million related to a prior registration statement.  As of February 2, 2005, $956.5 million in
equity securities


remained available for issuance under this registration statement.

The Company’s
“Consolidated Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization Ratio” as of December 31,
2004 is presented in the following table. 
The Company calculates the equity component of its market capitalization
as the sum of (i) the total outstanding Common Shares and assumed conversion of
all OP Units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the
Company’s Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) the “Common Share
Equivalent” of all convertible preferred shares and preference interests/units;
and (iii) the liquidation value of all perpetual preferred shares and
preference interests outstanding.

The Company’s
policy is to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt-to-total market
capitalization of less than 50%.

From
January 1, 2005 through February 7, 2005, the Company:

•

Acquired four properties consisting of 734
units and one parcel of vacant land for approximately $144.1 million;

•

Disposed of one property consisting of 450
units and a vacant land parcel (excluding condominium units) for approximately
$340.9 million;


•

Assumed $47.6 million of mortgage debt on two
properties in connection with their acquisitions;

•

Executed an
amended compensation agreement with its Chairman of the Board of Trustees
extending his current agreement on the same terms and conditions for two more

compensation grant of options and restricted shares; and

•

Issued irrevocable notices to redeem for cash
during March 2005 all 1,320,000 units of its 8.50% Series B and C Preference
Interests with a cumulative liquidation value of $66.0 million.

On
February 24, 2005, the Company received $57.1 million in cash for its ownership
interest in Rent.com in connection with the acquisition of Rent.com by eBay,
Inc.

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and
Improvements to Real Estate

Our

policy with
respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that
improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component
asset of the property.  We track
improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories:

•

Replacements

(inside the unit)

.  These include:

•

carpets
and hardwood floors;

•

appliances;

•

mechanical
equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc;

•

furniture
and fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans,
sinks, tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc;

•

flooring
such as vinyl, linoleum or tile; and

•

blinds/shades.

All
replacements are depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life.  We expense as incurred all maintenance and
turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual units and the
repair of any replacement item noted above.

•

Building
improvements (

outside the unit

).  These include:

•

roof
replacement and major repairs;

•

paving
or major resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks;

•

amenities
and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment,
lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices;

•

major
building mechanical equipment systems;

•

interior
and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding;

•

major
landscaping and grounds improvement; and

•

vehicles
and office and maintenance equipment.

All building
improvements are depreciated over a five to ten-year estimated useful
life.  We expense as incurred all
recurring expenditures that do not improve the value of the asset or extend its
useful life.

For the year
ended December 31, 2004, our actual improvements to real estate totaled
approximately $212.2 million.  This
includes the following detail (amounts in thousands except for unit and per
unit amounts):


(1)

Total units exclude 16,218 unconsolidated
units.

(2)

Wholly Owned Properties acquired prior to
January 1, 2002.

(3)

Wholly Owned Properties acquired during 2002,
2003 and 2004.  Per unit amounts are
based on a weighted average of 17,577 units.

(4)

Includes properties either Partially Owned or
sold during the period, commercial space, condominium conversions and $6.6
million included in building improvements spent on fifteen specific assets
related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets.

For the year
ended December 31, 2003, our actual improvements to real estate totaled
approximately $181.9 million.  This
includes the following detail (amounts in thousands except for unit and per
unit amounts):

(1)

Total units exclude 22,578 unconsolidated
units.

(2)

Wholly Owned Properties acquired prior to
January 1, 2001.

(3)

Wholly Owned Properties acquired during 2001,
2002 and 2003.  Per unit amounts are
based on a weighted average of 10,533 units.

(4)

Includes properties either Partially Owned or
sold during the period, commercial space, condominium conversions and $6.5
million included in building improvements spent on seven specific assets
related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets.

The Company
expects to fund approximately $160.0 million for capital expenditures for
replacements and building improvements for all consolidated properties,
exclusive of condominium conversion properties, in 2005.

During the
year ended December 31, 2004, the Company’s total non-real estate capital
additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and
fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Company’s property management
offices and its corporate offices, was approximately $6.6 million.  The


Company expects to fund
approximately $12.8 million in total additions to non-real estate property in
2005.

Improvements
to real estate and additions to non-real estate property were funded from net
cash provided by operating activities.

Derivative Instruments

In the normal course of business, the Company
is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes.  The Company limits these risks by following
established risk management policies and procedures including the use of
derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.

The Company has a policy of only entering
into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit
ratings and other factors.  When viewed
in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives
are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those
instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net
income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

See Note 11

in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of
derivative instruments at December 31, 2004.

Other

Minority
Interests as of December 31, 2004 decreased by $65.3 million when compared to
December 31, 2003.  The primary factors
that impacted this account in the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations and balance sheets during the year ended December 31, 2004 were:

•

Distributions
declared to Minority Interests, which amounted to $35.9 million (excluding
Junior Preference Unit and Preference Interest distributions);

•

The
allocation of income from operations to holders of OP Units in the amount of
$31.2 million;

•

The
issuance of 306,694 OP Units to various limited partners at an average price of
$29.63 per unit;

•

The
redemption of 800,000 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preference Interests with
a liquidation value of $40.0 million and a premium on redemption of $1.1
million (see Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion);

•

The
issuance of Common Shares; and

•

The
conversion of 1.7 million OP Units into Common Shares valued at $36.9 million
at an average price of $21.16 per unit.

Total
distributions paid in January 2005 amounted to $144.1 million (excluding
distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain
distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004.

The Company
expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital
expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain
scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, generally through its
working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under
its line of credit.  The Company
considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet
operating requirements and payments of distributions.  The Company also expects to meet its
long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage
debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and
development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of
unsecured notes and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and
proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties.  In addition, the Company has significant
unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in
the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of
alternative sources of capital is too high. 
The fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are
in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with
covenants


under its unsecured notes and
line of credit.  Of the $14.9 billion in
investment in real estate on the Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2004,
$9.5 billion or 63.8%, was unencumbered.

The Operating Partnership has a revolving credit facility with
potential borrowings of up to $700.0 million.   
This facility matures in May 2005 and may, among other potential uses,
be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under
development and short term liquidity requirements.  As of March 1, 2005, $135.0

million was outstanding under this facility (and $51.0 million
was restricted and dedicated to support letters of credit).

The Operating Partnership is currently negotiating a new credit
facility to replace or expand its existing facility and fully expects to obtain
this at current or improved terms in March or April 2005.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

The Company has co-invested in various properties
that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of
accounting.  Management does not believe
these investments have a materially different impact upon the Company’s
liquidity, capital resources, credit or market risk than its property
management and ownership activities.  The
nature and business purpose of these ventures are as follows:

•

Institutional Ventures – During 2000 and
2001, the Company entered into ventures with an unaffiliated partner.   At the respective closing dates, the Company
sold and/or contributed 45 properties containing 10,846 units to these ventures
and retained a 25% ownership interest in the ventures.  The Company’s joint venture partner
contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed-upon equity value of the properties
comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company. The
Company’s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its
concentration of properties in a variety of markets.

•

Lexford/Other – As of December 31, 2004, the
Company has ownership interests in twelve properties containing 1,571 units
acquired in a prior merger.  The current
weighted average ownership percentage is 11.0%. 
The Company’s strategy with respect to these interests is either to
acquire a majority ownership or sell the Company’s interest.

As of December
31, 2004, the Company has five projects totaling 1,306 units in various stages
of development with estimated completion dates ranging through September 30,
2006.  The three development agreements
currently in place have the following key terms:

•

The
first development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a
project subject to the agreement, to stipulate a value for such project and
offer to sell its interest in the project to the Company based on such value.  If the Company chooses not to purchase the
interest, the Company must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third
party at such value.  The Company’s
partner must exercise this right as to all projects subject to the agreement
within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on
the last developed property.   In
connection with this development partner, the Company has an obligation to
provide up to $40.0 million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of
the third party construction financing. 
As of February 2, 2005, the Company had set-aside $5.0 million towards
this credit enhancement.  The Company
would be required to perform under this agreement only if there was a material
default under a third party construction mortgage agreement.  This agreement expires no later than December
31, 2018.  Notwithstanding the
termination of the agreement, the Company shall have recourse against its development
partner for any losses incurred.

•

The
second development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a
project subject to the agreement, to require the Company to purchase the
partners’ interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price.  If the Company and the partner are unable to
agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals.  If the appraised values vary by more than
10%, both the Company and its


partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original
appraisal is closest to its determination of value.  The Company may elect at that time not to
purchase the property and instead, authorize its partner to sell the project at
or above the agreed-upon value to an unrelated third party.  Five years following the receipt of the final
certificate of occupancy on the last developed property, the Company must
purchase, at the agreed-upon price, any projects remaining unsold.

•

The third
development partner has the exclusive right for six months following
stabilization, as defined, to market a subject project for sale.  Thereafter, either the Company or its
development partner may market a subject project for sale. If the Company’s
development partner proposes the sale, the Company may elect to purchase the
project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale until two
independent appraisers appraise the project. 
If the two appraised values vary by more than 5%, a third appraiser will
be chosen to determine the fair market value of the property.  Once a value has been determined, the Company
may elect to purchase the property or authorize its development partner to sell
the project at the agreed-upon value.

See Note 6 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the
Company’s investments in unconsolidated entities.

In connection with one of
its mergers, the Company provided a guaranty of a credit enhancement agreement
with respect to certain tax-exempt bonds issued to finance certain public
improvements at a multifamily development project.  The Company has the obligation to provide
this guaranty for a period of eight years from the consummation of the merger
or through May 2005.  The Company would
be required to perform under this guaranty only if there was a draw on the
letter of credit issued by the credit enhancement party.  The counterparty has also indemnified the
Company for any losses suffered.  As of
February 2, 2005, this guaranty was still in effect at a commitment amount of
$10.4 million and no current outstanding liability.

The
following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations for the next
five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2004:

(a)   Amounts include aggregate principal payments
only.  The Company paid $348,574,
$352,391 and $365,782 for interest on debt, inclusive of derivative
instruments, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

(b)   Minimum basic rent due for various office
space the Company leases and fixed base rent due on a ground lease for one
property.

(c)   Estimated payments to the Company’s Chairman,
former CEO and two other executive officers based on planned retirement dates.

(d)   Promissory note due on one property, repaid
in January 2005.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

The
Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial
statements at and


for the year ended December 31,
2004.

The Company has identified six significant
accounting policies as critical accounting policies.  These critical accounting policies are those
that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those
requiring significant judgments and estimates. 
With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes
that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and
produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations
for all periods presented.  The six
critical accounting policies are:

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill

The Company periodically evaluates its
long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for
indicators of permanent impairment.  The
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors
such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of
each asset and legal and environmental concerns.  Future events could occur which would cause
the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss
is warranted.

Depreciation of
Investment in Real Estate

The Company depreciates the building
component of its investment in real estate over a 30-year estimated useful
life, building improvements over a 5-year to 10-year estimated useful life and
both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a
5-year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations.

Cost
Capitalization

See the

Capitalization
of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate

section for
discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed
asset/repair and maintenance costs.  In
addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees
directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of
major capital and/or renovation projects. 
These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to
depreciable property.

The Company follows the guidance in SFAS No.
67,

Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental
Operations of Real Estate Projects

, for all development projects and
uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the
criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred.  The Company capitalizes, through the date the
certificates of occupancy ("CO") are issued (CO's are deemed final within
90 days of issuance), interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and
associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend
all of their time on development activities. 
These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in
progress for each specific property.  The
Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working
directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties
prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major rennovation at
selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired.

Fair Value of
Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments

The valuation of financial instruments under
SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149)
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value
of the instruments.  The Company, where
possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its
derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where
these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on other factors
relevant to the financial instruments.


Revenue
Recognition

Rental income attributable to leases is
recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned,
which is not materially different than on a straight-line basis.  Leases entered into between a resident and a
property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year-to-year,
renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis.  Fee and asset management revenue and interest
income are recorded on an accrual basis.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Prior to 2003, the Company had
chosen to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No.
25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,

which resulted in no compensation expense
for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market
value of the Company’s Common Shares on the date of grant (intrinsic
method).  The Company elected to account
for its stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its
amendment (SFAS No. 148),

Accounting for
Stock Based Compensation

, effective in the first quarter of 2003,
which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value
of the stock compensation granted.

SFAS No. 148 provides three transition
methods for entities that adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123.  The Company elected the “Prospective
Method” which requires expensing of employee awards granted or modified after
January 1, 2003.  Compensation expense
under all of the Company’s plans is generally recognized over periods ranging
from three months to five years.  See
Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion
and comparative information regarding application of the fair value method to
all outstanding employee awards.

Funds
From Operations

For the year ended
December 31, 2004, Funds From Operations (“FFO”) available to Common Shares and
OP Units increased $11.4 million, or 1.8%, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2003, FFO available to
Common Shares and OP Units decreased $78.9 million, or 11.0%, as compared to
the year ended December 31, 2002.

The
following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO available to Common Shares and
OP Units for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:


Funds From Operations

(Amounts in thousands)

(1)

The National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from operations (“FFO”)
(April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP)), excluding gains (or
losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization,
and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships
and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the
same basis.  The April 2002 White Paper
states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for
previously depreciated operating properties only.  Once the Company commences the conversion of
units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such
property.

(2)

The Company believes that FFO is
helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of
a real estate company, because it is a recognized measure of performance by the
real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions
of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary
among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost
accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating
performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to
different companies.  FFO in and of
itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating
activities in accordance with GAAP. 
Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to
net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP
or as a measure of liquidity.  The
Company’s calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due
to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital
expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate
companies.


Item 7A

. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Market risks relating to the Company’s operations
result primarily from changes in short-term LIBOR interest rates.  The Company does not have any direct foreign
exchange or other significant market risk.

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured line of credit.  The Company typically incurs fixed rate debt
obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures, while it typically
incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a
temporary measure in advance of securing long-term fixed rate financing.  The Company continuously evaluates its level
of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including
its assessment of the current and future economic environment.

The
Company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market
risk.  Interest rate protection
agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice
versa.  Derivatives are used for hedging
purposes rather than speculation.  The
Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes.   See also Note 11 to the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative
instruments.

The
fair values of the Company’s financial instruments (including such items in the
financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents, other assets, line
of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses, rents received in advance and
other liabilities) approximate their carrying or contract values based on their
nature, terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates.  The fair value of the Company’s mortgage
notes payable and unsecured notes approximates their carrying value at December
31, 2004.

The
Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $1,389.0
million, or 21.5% of total debt at December 31, 2004, net of the effects of any
derivative instruments.  If market rates
of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 25 basis
points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest
rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would
decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $3.5

million.  If market
rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 25
basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average
interest rates), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt
would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $3.5

million.

At
December 31, 2004, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of
approximately $5.1 billion, net of the effects of any derivative instruments.  If market rates of interest permanently
increased by 65 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing
weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s
fixed rate debt would be approximately $4.6 billion.  If market rates of interest permanently
decreased by 65 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing
weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s
fixed rate debt would be approximately $5.6 billion.

At
December 31, 2004, the Company’s derivative instruments had a net liability
fair value of approximately $7.9 million. 
If market rates of interest permanently increased by 40 basis points (a
10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the
net liability fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments would be
approximately $13.9 million.  If market
rates of interest permanently decreased by 40 basis points (a 10% decrease from
the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair
value of the Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately $2.2
million.

These
amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest
rates on the Company’s financial instruments. 
The foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the Company’s
debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities.  These analyses do not consider the effects of
the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an
environment.  Further, in the event of
changes of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further
mitigate its exposure to


the changes.  However, due to the uncertainty of the
specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis
assumes no changes in the Company’s financial structure or results.

The
Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its
debt and derivative instruments and, therefore, its exposure to market risk,
nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at
advantageous pricing.  Consequently,
future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes
discussed above.

Item 9A

.   Controls and Procedures

(a)         Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures:

Effective as of December
31, 2004, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15.  Based on that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to
material information.  During the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2004, there were no changes to the internal controls
over financial reporting of the Company identified in connection with the
Company’s evaluation or otherwise that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over
financial reporting.

(b)         Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting:

Equity Residential’s
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Based on the Company’s evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework, management concluded that its internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.  Management’s assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been
audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which is included herein at Item 8, page F-3.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT

REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Equity
Residential (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004.  Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the accompanying index to the financial statements
and schedule.  These financial statements
and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Equity Residential at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for variable interest entities in 2004
and changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation in 2003.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Equity
Residential’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated February 28, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting at Item 9A,
that Equity Residential (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established
in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Criteria”).   The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.  Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Equity Residential
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO
Criteria.  Also, in our opinion, Equity
Residential maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO Criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance
sheets of Equity Residential as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 and our
report dated February 28, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1.

Business

Equity Residential (“EQR”), formed in March 1993, is a
fully integrated real estate company engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership,
management and operation of multifamily properties.  EQR has elected to be taxed as a real estate
investment trust (“REIT”).

EQR is the general
partner of, and as of December 31, 2004 owned an approximate 93.3% ownership
interest in ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership
(the “Operating Partnership”).   The
Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), under which
all property ownership and business operations are conducted through the
Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. 
References to the “Company” include EQR, the Operating Partnership and
each of the partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations
controlled by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company, directly or
indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a
portion of 939

properties in 32 states and the
District of Columbia consisting of 200,149 units.  The ownership breakdown includes:

The “Wholly Owned Properties” are accounted for under
the consolidation method of accounting. 
The Company beneficially owns 100% fee simple title to 841 of the 842
Wholly Owned Properties.  The Company
owns the building and improvements and leases the land underlying the
improvements under a long-term ground lease that expires in 2026 for one
property.  This one property is
consolidated and reflected as a real estate asset while the ground lease is
accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 13,

Accounting
for Leases

.

The “Partially
Owned Properties” are controlled by the Company but have partners with minority
interests and are accounted for under the consolidation method of
accounting.  The “Unconsolidated
Properties” are partially owned but not controlled by the Company.  With the exception of one property, the
Unconsolidated Properties consist of investments in partnership interests
and/or subordinated mortgages that are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting.  The remaining one property
consists of an investment in a limited liability company that, as a result of
the terms of the operating agreement, is accounted for as a management contract
right with all fees recognized as fee and asset management revenue.  The above table does not include various
uncompleted development properties.

2.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of
Presentation

Due to the Company’s ability as general partner to
control either through ownership or by contract the Operating Partnership and
its subsidiaries, other than entities that own controlling interests in the
Unconsolidated Properties and certain other entities in which the Company has
investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary has been
consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.  Effective March 31, 2004, the consolidated
financial statements also include all variable interest entities for which the
Company is the primary beneficiary.

F-12

The Company’s mergers and acquisitions were accounted
for as purchases in accordance with either Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
Opinion No. 16,

Business Combinations

,
or SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

.  SFAS No. 141 requires all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. The fair value of the consideration given by the Company
in the mergers were used as the valuation basis for each of the
combinations.  The accompanying
consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include the results of the
properties purchased through the mergers and through acquisitions from their
respective closing dates.

Real
Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate

The Company allocates the purchase price of properties
to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair
values in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141.  In making estimates of fair values for
purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of
sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection
with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis
of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio, and
other market data.  The Company also
considers information obtained about each property as a result of its
pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating
the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.  The Company allocates the purchase price of
acquired real estate to various components as follows:

•

Land – Based on actual purchase price
if acquired separately or market research/comparables if acquired with an
operating property.

•

Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment –
Ranges between $1,500 and $3,000 per apartment unit acquired as an estimate of
the fair value of the appliances & fixtures inside a unit.  The per-unit amount applied depends on the
type of apartment building acquired. 
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over an estimated
useful life of five years.

•

In-Place Leases – The Company
considers the value of acquired in-place leases that meet the definition
outlined in SFAS No. 141, paragraph 37. 
The amortization period is the average remaining term of each respective
in-place acquired lease.

•

Other Intangible Assets – The Company
considers whether it has acquired other intangible assets that meet the
definition outlined in SFAS No. 141, paragraph 39, including any customer
relationship intangibles.  The
amortization period is the estimated useful life of the acquired intangible
asset.

•

Building – Based on the fair value
determined on an “as-if vacant” basis. 
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over an estimated
useful life of thirty years.

Replacements inside
a unit such as appliances and carpeting are depreciated over a five-year
estimated useful life.  Expenditures for
ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and
significant renovations and improvements that improve and/or extend the useful
life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally
five to ten years.  Initial direct
leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense approximates the
deferral and amortization of initial direct leasing costs over the lease
terms.  Property sales or dispositions
are recorded when title transfers and sufficient consideration has been
received by the Company.  Upon
disposition, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from
the respective accounts.  Any gain or
loss on sale is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

The Company classifies real estate assets as real
estate held for disposition when it is certain a property will be disposed of
in accordance with SFAS No. 144 (see further discussion below).

The Company classifies properties under development
and/or expansion and properties in the lease up phase (including land) as
construction in progress until construction has been completed and all
certificates of occupancy permits have been obtained.

F-13

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

.  SFAS No.
142 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires that goodwill be
reviewed for impairment at least annually. 
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

SFAS Nos. 142 and 144 were effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. 
The Company adopted these standards effective January 1, 2002.  See Notes 13 and 19 for further discussion.

The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its
investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent
impairment.  The judgments regarding the
existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational
performance, market conditions, expected holding period of each asset and legal
and environmental concerns.  Future
events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment
indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.

For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company
compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long-lived asset
against the carrying amount of that asset. 
If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the
carrying amount of the asset, the Company further analyzes each individual
asset for other temporary or permanent indicators of impairment.  An impairment loss would be recorded for the
difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the
asset if the Company deems this difference to be permanent.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, an impairment
loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the asset, less the
estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the asset measured
at the time that the Company has determined it will sell the asset.  Long-lived assets held for disposition and
the related liabilities are separately reported at the lower of their carrying
amounts or their estimated fair values, less their costs to sell, and are not
depreciated after reclassification to real estate held for disposition.

Cost Capitalization

See the

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in
Real Estate

section for discussion of the policy with respect to
capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs.  In addition, the Company capitalizes the
payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who
spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and/or renovation
projects.  These costs are reflected on
the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.

The Company follows the
guidance in SFAS No. 67,

Accounting for
Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects

, for all
development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether
such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as
incurred.  The Company capitalizes,
through the date the certificates of occupancy ("CO") are issued (CO's
are deemed final within 90 days of issuance), interest, real estate taxes and
insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly
responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities.  These costs are reflected on the balance
sheet as construction in progress for each specific property.  The Company expenses as incurred all payroll
costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted
above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance
and on specific major rennovation at selected properties when additional
incremental employees are hired.

F-14

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all demand deposits, money
market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase
agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less, at the date of
purchase, to be cash equivalents.  The
Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions.  The combined account balances at one or more
institutions typically exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)
insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk
related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.  The Company believes that the risk is not
significant, as the Company does not anticipate the financial institutions’
non-performance.

Deferred
Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and costs
incurred to obtain the Company’s line of credit and long-term financings.  These costs are amortized over the terms of
the related debt.  Unamortized financing
costs are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date.  The accumulated amortization of such deferred
financing costs was $18.1 million and $16.0 million at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including
Derivative Instruments

The valuation of financial
instruments under SFAS No. 107,

Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

, and SFAS No. 133 and its
amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149),

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, requires the
Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
instruments.  The Company, where
possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its
derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where
these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on other factors
relevant to the financial instruments.

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of
interest rate changes.  The Company
limits these risks by following established risk management policies and
procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt
instruments.

The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major
financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  When viewed in conjunction with the
underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge,
the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does
it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial
position in the future from the use of derivatives.

On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 and its amendments
(SFAS Nos. 137/138/149), which requires an entity to recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to
measure those instruments at fair value. 
Additionally, the fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders’
equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify as
a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the hedging
activity.  When the terms of an
underlying transaction are modified, or when the underlying transaction is
terminated or completed, all changes in the fair value of the instrument are
marked-to-market with changes in value included in net income each period until
the instrument matures.  Any derivative
instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria of
SFAS No. 133 is marked-to-market each period. 
The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative
purposes.

The fair values of the Company’s financial
instruments, other than derivative instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, mortgage notes payable, other notes payable, line of credit and
other financial instruments, approximate their carrying or contract values.

F-15

Revenue
Recognition

Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when
due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not
materially different than on a straight-line basis.  Leases entered into between a resident and a
property, for the rental of an apartment unit, are generally year-to-year,
renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis.  Fee and asset management revenue and interest
income are recorded on an accrual basis.

Stock-Based Compensation

Prior to 2003, the Company had chosen to account for its stock-based compensation in
accordance with APB No. 25,

Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees

,

which
resulted in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price
equal to or exceeding the market value of the Company’s Common Shares on the
date of grant (intrinsic method).  The
Company elected to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with
SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148),

Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation

, effective in the first quarter of
2003, which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair
value of the stock compensation granted.

The Company elected the “Prospective Method” which requires expensing of
employee awards granted or modified after January 1, 2003.  Compensation expense under all of the Company’s
plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five
years.  The cost related to stock-based
employee compensation included in the determination of net income for the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 is less than that which would have been
recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since
the original effective date of SFAS No. 123.

The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based
Payment,

as required effective July 1, 2005.   The Company does not anticipate that the
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will have a material effect on its consolidated
statements of operations or financial position.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per
share if the fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding and
unvested awards in each period presented:

F-16

(1)

Share
options for the year ended December 31, 2003 included $1.4 million of expense
recognition related to options granted in the first quarter of 2003 to the
Company’s former chief executive officer. 
These options vested immediately upon grant.

The fair value of
the option grants as computed under SFAS No. 123 would be recognized over the
vesting period of the options.  The fair
value for the Company’s share options was estimated at the time the share
options were granted using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.  In addition, option valuation models require
the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company’s share options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in
the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate,
in management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its share options.

F-17

Income
Taxes

Due to the structure of
the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations of the properties and
management business, the results of operations do not contain a provision for
federal income taxes. The Company is subject to certain state and local income,
excise and franchise taxes.  The
aggregate cost of land and depreciable property for federal income tax purposes
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $9.3 billion and $8.5
billion, respectively.

The Company has elected
Taxable REIT Subsidiary (“TRS”) status for certain of its corporate
subsidiaries.  The federal income taxes
for these TRS entities were not material during 2004, 2003 or 2002 and were
recognized as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations.

During the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company’s tax treatment of dividends and
distributions were as follows:

Minority
Interests

Operating Partnership:  Net income is allocated to minority interests
based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating
Partnership.  The ownership percentage is
calculated by dividing the number of units of limited partnership interest (“OP
Units”) held by the minority interests by the total OP Units held by the
minority interests and EQR.  Issuance of
additional common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the
“Common Shares”), and OP Units changes the ownership interests of both the
minority interests and EQR.  Such
transactions and the proceeds therefrom are treated as capital transactions.

Partially Owned
Properties:  The Company reflects
minority interests in partially owned properties on the balance sheet for the
portion of properties consolidated by the Company that are not wholly owned by
the Company.  The earnings or losses from
those properties attributable to the minority interests are reflected as
minority interests in partially owned properties in the consolidated statements
of operations.

U

se of Estimates

In preparation of the
Company’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

F-18

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been made to the prior period
financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation.  These reclassifications have not changed the
results of operations or shareholders’ equity.

Other

The Company adopted FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No.
46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

as required, effective March 31, 2004. 
The adoption required the consolidation of all previously unconsolidated
development projects.  FIN No. 46
requires the Company to consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of
operations of the activities of a variable interest entity, which for the
Company includes only its development partnerships, if the Company is entitled
to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns and/or is subject to a
majority of the risk of loss from such entity’s activities.  As of the original formation of the
respective joint ventures, the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary
and the fair value of the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests of
these development projects approximates carryover basis.  Due to the March 31, 2004 effective date, the
Company has only consolidated the results of operations beginning April 1,
2004.  The adoption of FIN No. 46 did not
have any effect on net income as the aggregate results of operations of these
development properties were previously included in loss from investments in
unconsolidated entities.  See Note 4 for
additional discussion.

The Company generally contributes between 25% and
35% of the project cost of the joint venture projects under development
(constituting 100% of the equity), with the remaining cost financed through
third-party construction mortgages.  Voting
rights are shared equally between the Company and its respective development
partners and accordingly, these projects were accounted for under the equity
method prior to the adoption of FIN No. 46.

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

.  SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for
classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that
embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities
and equity.  On November 7, 2003, the
FASB issued FSP No. FAS 150-3, which deferred for an indefinite period the
classification and measurement provisions, but not the disclosure provisions
(see discussion below), of SFAS No. 150 as it relates to noncontrolling
interests that are classified as equity in the financial statements of a
subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in the parent’s financial
statements under SFAS No. 150 (e.g., minority interests in consolidated limited-life
subsidiaries).  The Company does not have
any mandatorily redeemable preferred shares/units that fall within the scope of
SFAS No. 150.

With
regards to the aforementioned disclosure provisions, the Company is presently
the controlling partner in various consolidated partnerships consisting of 39
properties and 7,220 units having a minority interest book value of $9.6
million at December 31, 2004. These partnerships contain provisions that
require the partnerships to be liquidated through the sale of its assets upon
reaching a date specified in each respective partnership agreement.  The Company, as controlling partner, has an
obligation to cause the property owning partnerships to distribute proceeds of
liquidation to the Minority Interests in these Partially Owned Properties only
to the extent that the net proceeds received by the partnerships from the sale
of its assets warrant a distribution based on the partnership agreements.  As of December 31, 2004, the Company
estimates the value of Minority Interest distributions would have been
approximately $111.3 million (“Settlement Value”) had the partnerships been
liquidated.  This Settlement Value is
based on estimated third party consideration realized by the partnerships upon
disposition of the Partially Owned Properties and is net of all other assets
and liabilities, including yield maintenance on the mortgages encumbering the
properties, that would have been due on December 31, 2004 had those mortgages
been prepaid.  Due to, among other
things, the inherent uncertainty in the sale of real estate assets, the amount
of any potential distribution to the Minority Interests in the Company’s

F-19

Partially
Owned Properties is subject to change. 
To the extent that the partnerships’ underlying assets are worth less
than the underlying liabilities, the Company has no obligation to remit any
consideration to the Minority Interests in Partially Owned Properties.

On July 31, 2003, the SEC
clarified its position with respect to Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Topic D-42,

The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share
for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock

.  Under the SEC’s revised interpretation, in
connection with the redemption of preferred shares/units, the original issuance
costs of these shares/units must be treated in a manner similar to preferred
distributions and deducted from net income in arriving at net income available
to Common Shares.  The clarification of
EITF Topic D-42 was required to be adopted effective July 1, 2003 on a
retroactive basis by restating prior periods included in the current financial
statements.  The Company recorded an $8.3
million cash premium and $11.9 million in original issuance costs as a premium
on the redemption of its Series G Preferred Shares in December 2003.  In addition, the Company recorded $1.1
million in original issuance costs as a premium on the redemption of its Series
A Preference Interests in September 2004. 
The Company had no recorded original issuance costs associated with, nor
did it incur any cash redemption premium upon redemption of, its Series L
Preferred Shares redeemed in 2003.

In April 2002, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 145,

Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections

.  SFAS No. 145,
among other items, rescinds the automatic classification of costs incurred on
debt extinguishment as extraordinary charges. 
Instead, gains and losses from debt extinguishment should only be
classified as extraordinary if they meet the “unusual and infrequently
occurring” criteria outlined in APB No. 30. 
SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15,
2002.  The Company adopted the standard
effective January 1, 2003.

Prior period
gains/losses have been reclassified to a component of interest expense.

Shareholders’ Equity and Minority Interests

The
following tables present the changes in the Company’s issued and outstanding
Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002:

F-20

In February 1998, the
Company filed and the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 Registration Statement
to register $1.0 billion of equity securities. 
In addition, the Company carried over $272.4 million related to a prior
registration statement.  As of December
31, 2004, $956.5 million in equity securities remained available for issuance
under this registration statement.

During October 2002, the Company repurchased 5,092,300 of its Common
Shares on the open market at an average price of $22.58 per share.  The Company paid approximately $115.0 million
for these shares, which were retired subsequent to the repurchase.

The equity positions of various individuals and entities
that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for
a partnership interest are collectively referred to as the “Minority Interests —
Operating Partnership”.  Subject to
certain  restrictions, the Minority
Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common
Shares on a one-for-one basis.  These OP
Units are classified as Minority Interests – Operating Partnership in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Net proceeds from the Company’s Common Share and Preferred
Share (see definition below) offerings are contributed by the Company to the
Operating Partnership.  In return for
those contributions, EQR receives a number of OP Units in the Operating
Partnership equal to the number of Common Shares it has issued in the equity
offering (or in the case of a preferred equity offering, a number of preference
units in the Operating Partnership equal in number and having the same terms as
the Preferred Shares issued in the equity offering).  As a result, the net offering proceeds from
Common Shares are allocated between shareholders’ equity and Minority Interests
– Operating Partnership to account for the change in their respective
percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

The Company’s declaration of trust authorizes the Company
to issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par
value per share (the “Preferred Shares”), with specific rights, preferences and
other attributes as the Board of Trustees may determine, which may include
preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the rights of holders of the
Company’s Common Shares.

The following table presents
the Company’s issued and outstanding Preferred Shares as of December 31, 2004
and 2003:

F-21

Inc. prior to its merger with the Company.

On June 19, 2003, the Company issued 600,000 Series N
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares in a public offering.  The Company received $145.3 million in net

redemption premium along with the write-off of $11.9 million in original
issuance costs as a premium on redemption of Preferred Shares in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

credit facility maturing May 29, 2005. 
Advances under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based
upon LIBOR at various interest periods, plus a spread dependent upon the
Operating Partnership’s credit rating, or based upon bids received from the
lending group.  EQR has guaranteed the
Operating Partnership’s line of credit up to the maximum amount and for the
full term of the facility.

As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, $150.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively, was outstanding and $65.4
million and $56.7 million, respectively, was restricted (dedicated to support
letters of credit and not available for borrowing) on the credit facility.  During the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, the weighted average interest rate was 1.73% and 1.85%, respectively.

Derivative Instruments

The
following table summarizes the consolidated derivative instruments at December
31, 2004 (dollar amounts are in thousands):

During
the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company paid approximately $3.3 million
to terminate five interest rate swaps in conjunction with the repayment of the
underlying mortgage loans.  The Company
recognized a $1.9 million loss in connection with these terminations (included
in loss from investments in unconsolidated entities as the losses occurred
prior to the acquisition and/or consolidation of the respective properties –
see further discussion in Notes 2 and 4). 
The Company also paid approximately $0.5 million to terminate two
forward starting swaps in conjunction with the issuance of $300.0 million of
five-year unsecured notes.  The $0.5
million cost has been deferred and will be recognized as additional interest
expense over the five-year life of the unsecured notes.  The Company also paid approximately $3.5
million to terminate ten forward starting swaps in conjunction with the
issuance of $500.0 million of ten-year unsecured notes.  Approximately $3.3 million of the $3.5
million cost has been deferred and will be recognized as additional interest
expense over the ten-year life of the

F-30

unsecured
notes.

On December 31, 2004, the net derivative instruments were reported at
their fair value as other assets of approximately $1.3 million and as other
liabilities of approximately $9.2 million. 
As of December 31, 2004, there were approximately $21.0 million in
deferred losses, net, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Based on the estimated fair values of the net
derivative instruments at December 31, 2004, the Company may recognize an
estimated $4.5 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as additional
interest expense during the twelve months ending December 31, 2005.

Earnings Per Share

The following tables set
forth the computation of net income per share – basic and net income per share –
diluted:

F-31

Convertible preferred shares/units that could be
converted into 3,215,472, 14,745,904 and 15,335,977 weighted average Common
Shares for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were
outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
because the effects would be anti-dilutive.

For additional disclosures regarding the employee
share options and restricted shares, see Notes 2 and 14.

13.

Discontinued
Operations

The Company has presented
separately as discontinued operations in all periods the results of operations
for all consolidated assets disposed of on or after January 1, 2002 (the date
of adoption of SFAS No. 144).

The components of discontinued operations are
outlined below and include the results of operations for the respective periods
that the Company owned such assets during each of the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002.

(1)

Includes expenses paid in
the current period for properties sold in prior periods related to the Company’s
period of ownership.

(2)

Interest includes only
specific amounts from each property sold.

For
the properties sold during 2004 (excluding condominium conversion properties),
the investment in real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, and the
mortgage notes payable balances at December 31, 2003 were $500.0 million and
$94.9 million, respectively.

On January 11, 2002, the
Company disposed of its furniture rental business for $30.0 million in cash and
received net proceeds of $28.7 million. 
After giving effect to a previously recorded impairment loss, no gain/loss
on sale was recognized as the net book value at the sale date approximated the
sales price.

14.

Share Incentive Plans

On
May 15, 2002, the shareholders of EQR approved the Company’s 2002 Share
Incentive Plan.  The maximum aggregate
number of awards that may be granted under this plan may not exceed 7.5% of the
Company’s outstanding Common Shares calculated on a “fully diluted” basis and
determined annually on

F-33

the first day of each calendar year.  As of January 1, 2005, this amount equaled
23,069,873, of which 17,683,625 is available for future issuance.  No awards may be granted under the 2002 Share
Incentive Plan after February 20, 2012.

Pursuant to the 2002 Share Incentive Plan and the
Fifth Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan (collectively
the “Share Incentive Plans”), officers, trustees, key employees and consultants
of the Company may be offered the opportunity to acquire Common Shares through
the grant of share options (“Options”) including non-qualified share options (“NQSOs”),
incentive share options (“ISOs”) and share appreciation rights (“SARs”), or may
be granted restricted or non-restricted shares. 
Additionally, officers and key employees of the Company may be awarded
Common Shares, subject to conditions and restrictions as described in the Share
Incentive Plans.  Finally, certain
executive officers of the Company are subject to the Company’s performance
based restricted share plan.  Options,
SARs, restricted shares and performance shares are sometimes collectively
referred to herein as “Awards”.

The Options generally are granted at the fair market
value of the Company’s Common Shares at the date of grant, vest over a three year
period, are exercisable upon vesting and expire ten years from the date of
grant.  The exercise price for all
Options under the Share Incentive Plans shall not be less than the fair market
value of the underlying Common Shares at the time the Option is granted.  The Fifth Amended and Restated 1993 Share
Option and Share Award Plan will terminate at such time as all outstanding
Awards have expired or have been exercised/vested.  The Board of Trustees may at any time amend
or terminate the Share Incentive Plans, but termination will not affect Awards
previously granted.  Any Options which
had vested prior to such a termination would remain exercisable by the holder
thereof.

As to the Options that have been granted through
December 31, 2004, generally, one-third are exercisable one year after the
initial grant, one-third are exercisable two years following the date such
Options were granted and the remaining one-third are exercisable three years
following the date such Options were granted.

As to the restricted shares that
have been awarded through December 31, 2004, these shares generally vest three
years from the award date.  During the
three-year period of restriction, the employee receives quarterly dividend
payments on their shares.  The Company’s
unvested restricted shareholders receive dividends at the same rate and on the
same date as any other Common Share holder. 
In addition, the Company’s unvested restricted shareholders have the
same voting rights as any other Common Share holder.  As a result, dividends paid on unvested
restricted shares are included as a distribution in excess of accumulated
earnings and have not been considered in reducing net income available to
Common Shares in a manner similar to the Company’s preferred share dividends
for the earnings per share calculation. 
If employment is terminated prior to the lapsing of the restriction, the
shares are canceled.

In addition, each year the
Company’s executive officers receive performance-based awards.  The executive officers have the opportunity
to earn in Common Shares an amount as little as 0% to as much as 225% of the
target number of performance-based awards. 
The owners of performance-based awards have no right to vote, receive
dividends or transfer the awards until Common Shares are issued in exchange for
the awards.  The number of Common Shares
the executive officer actually receives on the third anniversary of the grant
date will depend on the excess, if any, by which the Company’s Average Annual
Return (i.e., the average of the Common Share dividends declared during each
year as a percentage of the Common Share price as of the first business day of
the first performance year and the average percentage increase in funds from
operations (“FFO”) for each calendar year on a per share basis over the prior
year) for the three performance years exceeds the average of the 10-year
Treasury Note interest rate as of the first business day in January of each
performance year (the “T-Note Rate”).

F-34

Fifty percent of the Common
Shares to which an executive officer may be entitled under the performance
share grants will vest, subject to the executive’s continued employment with
the Company, on the third anniversary of the award (which will be the date the
Common Shares are issued); twenty-five percent will vest on the fourth
anniversary and the remaining twenty-five percent will vest on the fifth
anniversary.  The Common Shares will also
fully vest upon the executive’s death, retirement at or after age 62,
disability or upon a change in control of the Company.

The following table summarizes
information regarding both the restricted and performance-based share plans for
the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

Prior to 2003, the Company had chosen to account for its stock-based compensation in
accordance with APB No. 25,

Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees

,

which
resulted in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price
equal to or exceeding the market value of the Company’s Common Shares on the
date of grant (intrinsic method).  The
Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance
with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148),

Accounting for Stock Based Compensation

, effective in the
first quarter of 2003, which resulted in compensation expense being recorded
based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted.

Compensation expense related to restricted and
performance-based share grants was previously recognized in accordance with APB
No. 25.  The adoption of SFAS No. 123
does not significantly change the amount of compensation expense recognized for
these grants.

See Note 2 for additional information regarding the
Company’s stock-based compensation.

The table below summarizes the Option activity of the
Share Incentive Plans and options assumed in connection with mergers (the “Merger
Options”) for the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

F-35

The following table summarizes information regarding options
outstanding at December 31, 2004:

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, 8,274,915 Options
(with a weighted average exercise price of $23.86) and 8,252,203 Options (with
a weighted average exercise price of $22.25) were exercisable, respectively.

F-36

15.

Employee
Plans

The Company established an Employee Share Purchase
Plan (the “ESPP”) to provide employees and trustees the ability to annually
acquire up to $100,000 of Common Shares of the Company.  In 2003, the Company’s shareholders approved
an increase in the aggregate number of Common Shares available under the ESPP
to 7,000,000 (from 2,000,000).  The
Company has 4,770,937 Common Shares available for purchase under the ESPP at
December 31, 2004.  The Common Shares may
be purchased quarterly at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of: (a) the
closing price for a share on the last day of such quarter; and (b) the greater
of: (i) the closing price for a share on the first day of such quarter, and
(ii) the average closing price for a share for all the business days in the
quarter.  The following table summarizes
information regarding the Common Shares issued under the ESPP:

The Company established a defined contribution plan
(the “401(k) Plan”) to provide retirement benefits for employees that meet
minimum employment criteria.  The Company
matches dollar for dollar up to the first 2% of eligible compensation that a
participant contributes to the 401(k) Plan (4% for 2002 and prior years).  Participants are vested in the Company’s
contributions over five years.  The
Company made contributions in the amount of $1.5 million and $3.5 million for
the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and expects to make
contributions in the amount of approximately $2.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

The Company may also elect
to make an annual discretionary profit-sharing contribution as a percentage of
each individual employee’s eligible compensation under the 401(k) Plan.  The Company did not make a contribution for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002.

The Company established a
supplemental executive retirement savings plan (the “SERP”) to provide certain
officers and trustees an opportunity to defer a portion of their eligible
compensation in order to save for retirement. 
The SERP is restricted to investments in Company Common Shares, certain
marketable securities that have been specifically approved, and cash
equivalents.  The deferred compensation
liability represented in the SERP and the securities issued to fund such
deferred compensation liability are consolidated by the Company and carried on
the Company’s balance sheet, and the Company’s Common Shares held in the SERP
are accounted for as a reduction to paid in capital.

16.

Distribution
Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan

On November 3, 1997, the Company filed with the SEC a
Form S-3 Registration Statement to register 14,000,000 Common Shares pursuant
to a Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (the “DRIP Plan”).  The registration statement was declared
effective on November 25, 1997.  The
Company has 11,571,446 Common Shares available for issuance under the DRIP Plan
at December 31, 2004.

The DRIP Plan provides holders of record and
beneficial owners of Common Shares and Preferred Shares with a simple and
convenient method of investing cash distributions in additional Common Shares
(which is referred to herein as the “Dividend Reinvestment – DRIP Plan”).  Common Shares may also be purchased on a
monthly basis with optional cash payments made by participants in the DRIP Plan
and interested new investors, not currently shareholders of the Company, at the
market price of the Common Shares less a discount ranging between 0% and 5%, as
determined in accordance with the DRIP Plan (which

F-37

is referred to herein as the “Share Purchase – DRIP Plan”).  Common Shares purchased under the DRIP Plan
may, at the option of the Company, be directly issued by the Company or
purchased by the Company’s transfer agent in the open market using participants’
funds.

17.

Transactions
with Related Parties

The Company provided asset and property management
services to certain related entities for properties not owned by the
Company.  Fees received for providing
such services were approximately $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.7 million
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company reimbursed its Chief
Operating Officer for the actual operating costs (excluding acquisition costs)
of operating his personal aircraft for himself and other employees on Company
business.  Amounts incurred were
approximately $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company leases its corporate headquarters from an
entity controlled by EQR’s Chairman of the Board of Trustees.  Amounts incurred for such office space for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were
approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $1.6 million.  The Company believes these amounts equal
market rates for such space.

The Company had the following additional
non-continuing related party transactions:

•

The Company
leased space in an office building in Augusta, Georgia indirectly owned by one
of EQR’s trustees since May 2003 and directly owned by an entity affiliated
with the same EQR trustee from 1998 to 2003 (individual was a trustee through
May 2004).  Amounts incurred for such
office space were approximately $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively;

•

Certain
executive officers of the Company purchased Common Shares which were financed
with loans made by the Company, all of which were repaid in full in 2002;

•

The Company made
consulting payments to two former trustees (individuals were trustees through
May 2003) of approximately $0.2 million during the year ended December 31,
2002; and

•

The Company paid
legal fees to a law firm of which one of EQR’s former trustees (individual was
a trustee through May 2002) is a partner of approximately $0.3 million during
the year ended December 31, 2002.

18.

Commitments
and Contingencies

The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to
various Federal, state and local environmental laws.  Compliance by the Company with existing laws
has not had a material adverse effect on the Company.  However, the Company cannot predict the
impact of new or changed laws or regulations on its current properties or on
properties that it may acquire in the future.

In August 2004, the Company
tried a class action lawsuit in Palm Beach County, Florida regarding certain
charges made to residents who terminated their leases early or failed to
provide sufficient notice of intent to vacate. 
In December 2004, the Court issued a Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
Law holding those fees legally uncollectible under Florida law. In recognition
of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which awarded damages and
interest to the class in the amount of approximately $1.6 million, the Company
established a reserve of approximately $1.6 million and correspondingly
recorded this as a general and administrative expense.  Due to pending appeals, the award is neither
final nor enforceable.  Accordingly, it
is not possible to determine or predict the ultimate outcome of the case.  While no assurances can be given, the Company
does not believe that this lawsuit,

F-38

if the ultimate outcome is unfavorable, will
have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company does not believe
there is any other litigation pending or threatened against the Company which,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably may be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Company.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
established a reserve and recorded a corresponding expense of $15.2 million in
estimated uninsured property damage at certain of its properties primarily
located in Florida caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne
(included in rents received in advance and other liabilities and real estate
taxes and insurance expense on the consolidated balance sheets and statements
of operations, respectively).  Of this
amount, approximately $9.4 million had been spent for hurricane related repairs
through December 31, 2004.

As of December 31,
2004 the Company has five projects

totaling 1,306 units

in various
stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through September
30, 2006. The three development agreements currently in place have the
following key terms:

•

The first development partner has
the right, at any time following completion of a project subject to the
agreement, to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest
in the project to the Company based on such value.  If the Company chooses not to purchase the
interest, the Company must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third
party at such value.  The Company’s
partner must exercise this right as to all projects subject to the agreement
within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on
the last developed property.  In
connection with this development agreement, the Company has an obligation to provide up to $40.0 million in credit
enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party construction
financing.  As of February 2, 2005, the
Company had set-aside $5.0 million towards this credit enhancement.  The Company would be required to perform
under this agreement only if there was a material default under a third party
construction mortgage agreement.  This
agreement expires no later than December 31, 2018.  Notwithstanding the termination of the
agreement, the Company shall have recourse against its development partner for
any losses incurred.

•

The second
development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a
project subject to the agreement, to require the Company to purchase the
partners’ interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price.  If the Company and the partner are unable to
agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals.  If the appraised values vary by more than
10%, both the Company and its partner will agree on a third appraiser to
determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of
value.  The Company may elect at that
time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize its partner to sell
the project at or above the agreed-upon value to an unrelated third party.

Five years
following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last
developed property, the Company must purchase, at the agreed-upon price, any
projects remaining unsold.

•

The
third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following
stabilization, as defined, to market a subject project for sale.  Thereafter, either the Company or its
development partner may market a subject project for sale.  If the Company’s development partner proposes
the sale, the Company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed
by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the
project.  If the two appraised values
vary by more than 5%, a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair
market value of the property.  Once a
value has been determined, the Company may elect to purchase the property or
authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreed-upon value.

In
connection with one of its mergers, the Company provided a guaranty of a credit
enhancement agreement with respect to certain tax-exempt bonds issued to
finance certain public improvements at a multifamily development project.  The Company has the obligation to provide
this guaranty for a period of eight years from the consummation of the merger
or through May 2005.  The Company would
be required

F-39

to perform under this agreement only if there
was a draw on the letter of credit issued by the credit enhancement party.  The counterparty has also agreed to indemnify
the Company for any losses suffered.  As
of December 31, 2004, this guaranty was still in effect at a commitment amount
of $12.7 million (reduced to $10.4 million effective in January 2005) and no
current outstanding liability.

During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, total operating
lease payments incurred for office space, including a portion of real estate taxes,
insurance, repairs and utilities, aggregated $5.8 million, $5.7 million and $5.8
million, respectively.

The Company has entered into a retirement benefits
agreement with its Chairman of the Board of Trustees and deferred compensation
agreements with two of its executive officers and its former chief executive
officer.  During the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized compensation expense of
$39,000, $3.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively, related to these
agreements.

The following table summarizes the Company’s
contractual obligations for minimum rent payments under operating leases and
deferred compensation for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31,
2004:

(a)

Minimum basic rent due for
various office space the Company leases and fixed base rent due on a ground
lease for one property.

(b)

Estimated payments to the Company’s
Chairman, former CEO and two other executive officers based on planned
retirement dates.

19.

Asset
Impairment

The Company recorded approximately $1.2 million of
asset impairment charges related to its technology investments in each of the
years ending December 31, 2003 and 2002. These charges were the result of a
review of the existing investments reflected on the consolidated balance
sheet.  These impairment losses are
reflected on the consolidated statements of operations in total expenses and
include the write-down of assets classified as other assets.

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
the Company recorded approximately $17.1 million of asset impairment charges
related to its corporate housing business. 
Following the guidance in SFAS No. 142, these charges were the result of
the Company’s decision to reduce the carrying value of its corporate housing
business to $30.0 million, given the weakness in the economy and management’s
expectations for near-term performance. 
This impairment loss is reflected on the consolidated statements of
operations as impairment on corporate housing business and on the consolidated
balance sheets as a reduction in goodwill, net.

20.

Reportable
Segments

Operating segments are
defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated regularly by senior management.  Senior management decides how resources are
allocated and assesses performance on a monthly basis.

The Company’s primary
business is owning, managing, and operating multifamily residential properties,
which includes the generation of rental and other related income through the
leasing of

F-40

apartment units to residents and includes
Equity Corporate Housing (“ECH”).  Senior
management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment communities on an
individual basis; however, each of our apartment communities has similar
economic characteristics, residents, and products and services so they have
been aggregated into one reportable segment. 
The Company’s rental real estate segment comprises approximately 99.4%,
99.2% and 99.4% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.  The Company’s
rental real estate segment comprises approximately 99.8% and 99.7% of total
assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The primary financial
measure for the Company’s rental real estate segment is net operating income (“NOI”),
which represents rental income less: 1) property and maintenance expense; 2)
real estate taxes and insurance expense; and 3) property management expense
(all as reflected in the accompanying statements of operations).  The Company believes that NOI is helpful to
investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real
estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results
of the Company’s apartment communities. 
Current year NOI is compared to prior year NOI and current year budgeted
NOI as a measure of financial performance. 
The following table presents the NOI from our rental real estate
specific to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively:

The Company’s fee and asset
management activity is immaterial and does not meet the threshold requirements
of a reportable segment as provided for in SFAS No. 131.

All revenues are from
external customers and there is no customer who contributed 10% or more of the
Company’s total revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
or 2002.

21.

Subsequent
Events/Other

Subsequent to December 31, 2004 and through February 7,
2005, the Company:

•

Acquired four
properties consisting of 734 units and one parcel of vacant land for
approximately $144.1 million;

•

Disposed of one
property consisting of 450 units (excluding condominium units) and a vacant
land parcel for approximately $340.9 million;

•

Assumed $47.6
million of mortgage debt on two properties in connection with their
acquisitions;

•

Executed an amended compensation agreement with its
Chairman of the Board of Trustees extending his current agreement on the same
terms and conditions for two more years through 2006 and providing him with a
$3.25 million per year long-term compensation grant of options and restricted
shares; and

•

Issued irrevocable notices to redeem for cash during
March 2005 all 1,320,000 units of its 8.50% Series B and C Preference Interests
with a cumulative liquidation value of $66.0 million.

On February 24, 2005, the Company received $57.1
million in cash for its ownership interest in Rent.com in connection with the
acquisition of Rent.com by eBay, Inc.

Quarterly
Financial Data (Unaudited)

The following unaudited quarterly data has been
prepared on the basis of a December 31 year-end.  All amounts have also been restated in
accordance with the discontinued operations provisions of SFAS No 144.  Amounts are in thousands, except for per
share amounts.

(1)

The amounts presented for the first three quarters of 2004 are not
equal to the same amounts previously reported in the respective Form 10-Q’s
filed with the SEC for each period as a result of changes in discontinued
operations due to additional property sales which occurred throughout 2004 and
the Company’s reclassification of its Minority Interest distributions on
Preference Interests and Junior Preference Units.  Below is a reconciliation to the amounts
previously reported in the respective Form 10-Q’s:

F-42

(2)

The amounts presented for the four quarters of 2003 are not equal to
the same amounts previously reported in the respective Form 10-Q’s/10-K filed
with the SEC for each period as a result of changes in discontinued operations
due to additional property sales which occurred throughout 2004 and 2003 and
the Company’s reclassification of

F-43

its Minority Interest distributions on
Preference Interests and Junior Preference Units.  Below is a reconciliation to the amounts
previously reported in the respective Form 10-Q’s/10-K:

*

The
Company did not have any extraordinary items or cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.  Therefore, income before extraordinary items
and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is not shown as it was
equal to the net income amounts disclosed above.
