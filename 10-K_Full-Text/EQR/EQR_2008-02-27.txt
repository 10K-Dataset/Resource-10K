EQUITY RESIDENTIAL



Item 1.  Business

General

Equity Residential (“EQR”), a Maryland real
estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500
company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality
apartment properties in top United States growth markets.  EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT.

The Company is one of the
largest publicly traded real estate companies and is the largest publicly
traded owner of multifamily properties (based on the aggregate market value of
its outstanding Common Shares, the number of apartment units wholly owned and
total revenues earned).  The Company’s
corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also
operates approximately thirty-five property management offices throughout the
United States.

EQR is the general
partner of, and as of December 31, 2007 owned an approximate 93.6%
ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited
partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). 
The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”),
under which all property ownership and business operations are conducted
through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.  References to the “Company” include EQR, the
Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled by the Operating
Partnership and/or EQR.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company,
directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all
or a portion of 579

properties in
24 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 152,821 units.  The ownership breakdown includes (table does
not include various uncompleted development properties):

As of February 6, 2008,
the Company has approximately 4,800 employees who provide real estate
operations, leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition,
development and other support functions.

Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business
Objectives and Operating Strategies

The
Company seeks to maximize current income, capital appreciation of each property
and the total return for its shareholders. 
The Company’s strategy for accomplishing these objectives includes:

·

Leveraging our size and
scale in four critical ways:


·

Investing in apartment communities located in strategically targeted
markets, to maximize our total return on an enterprise level;

·

Meeting

the needs of our residents by offering a wide array of product choices
and a commitment to service;

·

Engaging, retaining, and attracting the best employees by providing
them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed; and

·

Sharing resources, customers and best practices in property management
and across the enterprise.

·

Owning a highly diversified portfolio by investing in target markets
defined by a combination of the following criteria:

·

High barrier-to-entry (low supply);

·

Strong

economic predictors (high demand); and

·

Attractive

quality of life (high demand and retention).

·

Giving residents reasons to stay with the Company by providing a range
of product options available in our diversified portfolio and by enhancing
their experience through our employees and our services.

·

Being open and
responsive to market realities to take advantage of investment opportunities
that align with our long-term vision.

Acquisition,
Development and Disposition Strategies

The Company anticipates
that future property acquisitions, developments and dispositions will occur
within the United States.  Acquisitions
and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may
include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt securities,
sales of properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and
uncollateralized borrowings.  In
addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the
issuance of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (“OP
Units”) as consideration for the acquired properties.  Such transactions may, in certain
circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the
recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales.  In addition, EQR may acquire or develop
multifamily properties specifically to convert directly into condominiums as
well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual condominiums.  EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold
and/or sell based on market opportunities.

When evaluating
potential acquisitions, developments and dispositions, the Company generally
considers the following factors:

·

strategically targeted markets;

·

income levels
and employment growth trends in the relevant market;

·

employment and
household growth and net migration of the relevant market

’

s population;

·

barriers to
entry that would limit competition (zoning laws, building permit availability,
supply of undeveloped or developable real estate, local building costs and
construction costs, among other factors);

·

the location, construction quality, condition and design of the
property;

·

the current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to
increase cash flow;

·

the potential for capital appreciation of the property;

·

the terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent
increases;

·

the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory
environment of the community in which the property is located;

·

the occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type
in the vicinity (the overall market and submarket);


·

the prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of
the property;

·

the benefits of integration into existing operations;

·

purchase prices and yields
of available existing stabilized properties, if any;

·

competition from existing multifamily properties, residential
properties under development and the potential for the construction of new
multifamily properties in the area; and

·

opportunistic selling based on demand and price of high quality assets,
including condominium conversions.

The Company generally
reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve
its acquisition and development strategies and at times to fund its share
repurchase activities.  In addition, when
feasible, the Company may structure these transactions as tax-deferred
exchanges.

has an unsecured revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to
$1.5 billion maturing on February 28, 2012, with the ability to increase
available borrowings by an additional $500.0 million by adding additional banks
to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their
commitments.  Advances under the credit
facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest
periods plus a spread dependent upon the Operating Partnership

’s

credit rating or based on bids received

Operating Partnership obtained a three-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving
credit facility maturing on May 29, 2008. 
Advances under the credit facility bore interest at variable rates based
upon LIBOR at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the
Operating Partnership

’s


credit rating or based on bids received from
the lending group.  EQR guaranteed the
Operating Partnership

’s

credit
facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.  This credit facility was repaid in full and
terminated on February 28, 2007. 
The Company recorded $0.4 million of write-offs of unamortized deferred
financing costs as additional interest in connection with this termination.

On May 7, 2007, the
Operating Partnership obtained a one-year $500.0 million unsecured revolving
credit facility maturing on May 5, 2008. 
Advances under this facility bore interest at variable rates based on
LIBOR at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the Operating
Partnership

’s

Partnership’s credit rating.  EQR
guaranteed this credit facility up to the maximum amount and for its full
term.  This credit facility was repaid in
full and terminated on October 13, 2006.

As

million, respectively, was outstanding and $80.8 million and $69.3 million,
respectively, was restricted (dedicated to support letters of credit and not
available for borrowing) on the credit facilities.  During the years ended December 31, 2007
and 2006, the weighted average interest rates under the credit facilities were
5.68% and 5.40%, respectively.

Competition

All
of the Company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other
multifamily properties.  The number of
competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material
effect on the Company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any
newly acquired properties and on the rents charged.  The Company may be competing with other
entities that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have
more experience than the Company’s managers. 
In addition, other forms of rental properties and single-family housing
provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily
properties.  See Item 1A Risk Factors for
additional information with respect to competition.

Environmental Considerations

See Item 1A Risk Factors for information concerning the potential
effects of environmental regulations on our operations.

Item
1A.  Risk Factors

General

The following Risk Factors may
contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other sections
of this report.  Unless otherwise
indicated, when used in this section, the terms

“

we

”

and

“

us

”

refer to Equity Residential and its subsidiaries, including ERP Operating
Limited Partnership.

The occurrence of the
events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect, possibly
in a material manner, our business, financial condition or results of
operations, which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of
beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest (which we refer
to collectively as “Shares”); preference interests (“Interests”) of a
subsidiary of ERP Operating Limited Partnership, our operating partnership; and
limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”).  In this section, we refer to the Shares,
Interests, Units and the OP Units together as our “securities”, and the
investors who own Shares, Interests, Units and/or OP Units as our “security
holders”.


Our Performance and Securities Value are Subject to
Risks Associated with the Real Estate Industry

General

Real property investments
are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid. Several
factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our
properties.  These factors include
changes in the national, regional and local economic climates, local conditions
such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for
our multifamily properties, the attractiveness of our properties to residents,
competition from other available multifamily property owners and changes in
market rental rates.  Our performance
also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for
adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real
estate taxes, which could increase over time. 
Also, the expenses of owning and operating a property are not
necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition
cause a reduction in income from the property.

We May Be Unable to
Renew Leases or Relet Units as Leases Expire

When our residents decide
not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be able to relet their
units.  Even if the residents do renew or
we can relet the units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable
than current lease terms.  Because
virtually all of our leases are for apartments, they are generally for terms of
no more than one year.  If we are unable
to promptly renew the leases or relet the units, or if the rental rates upon
renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our
results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.  Consequently, our cash flow and ability to
service debt and make distributions to security holders would be reduced.

New Acquisitions,
Developments and/or Condominium Conversion Projects May Fail to Perform as
Expected and Competition for Acquisitions May Result in Increased Prices
for Properties

We intend to actively
acquire and develop multifamily properties for rental operations and/or
conversion into condominiums, as well as upgrade and sell existing properties
as individual condominiums. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an
acquired or development property up to standards established for its intended
market position.  Additionally, we expect
that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete
with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties
in markets where we focus our development efforts.  This competition may increase prices for
multifamily properties or decrease the price at which we expect to sell
individual properties.  We may not be in
a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property
acquisitions on favorable terms.  We also
plan to develop more properties ourselves in addition to co-investing with our
development partners for either the rental or condominium market, depending on
opportunities in each sub-market.  This
may increase the overall level of risk associated with our developments.  The total number of development units, cost
of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties
arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and
construction materials), competition and local government regulation.

Because Real Estate
Investments Are Illiquid, We May Not Be Able to Sell Properties When
Appropriate

Real estate investments
generally cannot be sold quickly.  We may
not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or
other conditions.  This inability to
respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could
adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to
our security holders.

Changes in Laws and
Litigation Risk Could Affect Our Business

We are generally not able to
pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate or other
federal, state or local taxes.  Consequently,
any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial


condition and limit our ability to make
distributions to our security holders. 
Similarly, changes that increase our potential liability under
environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance would
adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our
securities.

We may become involved in
legal proceedings, including but not limited to, proceedings related to
consumer, employment, development, condominium conversion, tort and commercial
legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us, could result in
liability material to our financial condition or results of operations.

Environmental Problems Are
Possible and Can Be Costly

Federal, state and local
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require
a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean
up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such
property.  The owner or operator may have
to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for
investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with
the contamination.  These laws typically
impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the
owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants.  Even if more than one person may have been
responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental
laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred.  In addition, third parties may sue the owner
or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination
emanating from that site.

Substantially all of our
properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by
qualified independent environmental consultant companies.  These environmental assessments have not
revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that our management
believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Over the past several years,
there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of
multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by
the presence of mold in residential real estate.  Some of these lawsuits have resulted in
substantial monetary judgments or settlements. 
Insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding
mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at
prohibitively high rates.  We have
adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our
properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports
of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property.

We cannot be assured that
existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental
liabilities, that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a
material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material
environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties.

Insurance Policy
Deductibles and Exclusions

In order to partially
mitigate the substantial increase in insurance costs in recent years,
management has gradually increased deductible and self-insured retention
amounts.  As of December 31, 2007,
the Company’s property insurance policy provides for a per occurrence
deductible of $250,000 and
self-insured retention of $5.0 million per occurrence, subject to a maximum
annual aggregate self-insured retention of $7.5 million, with approximately 85%
of any excess losses being covered by insurance.  Any earthquake and named windstorm losses are
subject to a deductible of 5% of the values of the buildings involved in the
losses and are not subject to the aggregate self-insured retention.  The Company’s general liability and worker’s
compensation policies at December 31, 2007 provide for a $2.0 million and
$1.0 million per occurrence deductible, respectively.  These higher deductible and self-insured
retention amounts do expose the Company to greater potential uninsured losses,
but management believes the savings in insurance premium expense justifies this
potential increased exposure over the long-term.


As a result of the terrorist
attacks of September 11, 2001, property insurance carriers have created
exclusions for losses from terrorism from our

“

all
risk

”

property insurance
policies.  As of December 31, 2007,
the Company was insured for $500.0 million in terrorism insurance coverage,
with a $100,000 deductible.  This
coverage excludes losses from nuclear, biological and chemical attacks.  In the event of a terrorist attack impacting
one or more of our properties, we could lose the revenues from the property,
our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from
residents or others suffering injuries or losses.  The Company believes, however, that the
number and geographic diversity of its portfolio and its terrorism insurance
coverage help to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with potential
terrorist attacks.

Debt Financing, Preferred Shares and Preference
Interests and Units Could Adversely Affect Our Performance

General

Please refer to Item 7

, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations,

for the Company’s total debt and unsecured
debt summaries as of December 31, 2007.

In addition to debt, we have
$209.8 million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of
beneficial interest and preference interests and units, with a weighted average
dividend preference of 6.94% per annum, as of December 31, 2007.  Our use of debt and preferred equity
financing creates certain risks, including the following:

Disruptions in the
Financial Markets Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to Obtain Debt Financing
and Impact our Acquisitions and Dispositions

The United States credit
markets could experience significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions
which could cause the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen
considerably and make it harder for borrowers to borrow money.  These circumstances could materially impact
liquidity in the debt markets, make financing terms for us less attractive, and
result in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing.  For example, the Company has debt obligations
where the interest rates reset weekly (floating rate tax exempt bond
debt).  We could be negatively impacted
by disruptions in this market or in the credit market’s perception of Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, who guaranty and provide liquidity for these bonds.  Uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively
impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult for us to
sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties
that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt
financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.  Potential disruptions in the financial
markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy
generally.

Scheduled Debt Payments
Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition

In the future, our cash flow
could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to
pay distributions on our securities at expected levels.

We may not be able to
refinance existing debt (which in virtually all cases requires substantial
principal payments at maturity) and, if we can, the terms of such refinancing
might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.  If principal payments due at maturity cannot
be refinanced, extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions, such
as new equity capital, our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to
repay all maturing debt.  As a result, we
may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of
our properties and may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that
would otherwise be unacceptable to us.

Please refer to Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

, for the Company’s debt maturity schedule as of December 31,
2007.

Financial Covenants Could
Adversely Affect the Company’s Financial Condition

If a property we own is
mortgaged to secure debt and we are unable to meet the mortgage


payments, the holder of the mortgage could
foreclose on the property, resulting in loss of income and asset value.  Foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an
inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative
impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

The mortgages on our
properties may contain negative covenants that, among other things, limit our
ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the
property and to reduce or change insurance coverage.  In addition, our unsecured credit facilities
contain certain restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability
to incur debt.  The indentures under
which a substantial portion of our debt was issued also contain certain
financial and operating covenants including, among other things, maintenance of
certain financial ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur
secured and unsecured debt (including acquisition financing), and to sell all
or substantially all of our assets.  Our
credit facilities and indentures are cross-defaulted and also contain cross
default provisions with other material debt. 
Our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants as of December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively, are (terms are defined in the indentures):

Some of the properties were
financed with tax-exempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or
deed restrictions.  We have retained an
independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive
covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties.  If these bond compliance requirements
restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to attract low or
moderate-income residents, or eligible/qualified residents, then our income
from these properties may be limited.

Our Degree of Leverage
Could Limit Our Ability to Obtain Additional Financing

Our consolidated
debt-to-total market capitalization ratio was 47.0% as of December 31,
2007.  Our degree of leverage could have
important consequences to security holders. 
For example, the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain
additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes, making us more
vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general.

Rising Interest Rates
Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow

Advances under our credit
facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest
periods, plus a spread dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s credit
rating, or based upon bids received from the lending group.  Certain public issuances of our senior
unsecured debt instruments may also, from time to time, bear interest at
floating rates.  We may also borrow
additional money with variable interest rates in the future.  Increases in interest rates would increase
our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs
of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt.  Accordingly, higher interest rates could
adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make
distributions to security holders.  We
use interest rate hedging arrangements to manage our exposure to interest rate
volatility, but these arrangements may expose us to additional risks, and no
strategy can


completely insulate us from risks associated
with interest rate fluctuations.  There
can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will have the desired
beneficial impact and may involve costs, such as transaction fees or breakage
costs, if we terminate them.

We Depend on Our Key Personnel

We
depend on the efforts of the Chairman of our Board of Trustees, Samuel Zell,
and our executive officers, particularly David J. Neithercut, our President and
Chief Executive Officer.  If they resign
or otherwise cease to be employed by us, our operations could be temporarily
adversely affected.  Mr. Zell has
entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the
Company.

In
the event the Chairman of the Board and/or the CEO are unable to serve, (i) the
Lead Trustee will automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor
to the Chairman, (ii) the Chairman will automatically be appointed to
serve as the interim successor to the CEO and (iii) the Chair of the
Compensation Committee of the Board will immediately call a meeting of the
Committee to recommend to the full Board the selection of a permanent
replacement for either or both positions, as necessary.

Control and Influence by
Significant Shareholders Could Be Exercised in a Manner Adverse to Other
Shareholders

The
consent of certain affiliates of Mr. Zell is required for certain
amendments to the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership
of the Operating Partnership (the

“

Partnership
Agreement

”

).  As a result of their security ownership and
rights concerning amendments to the Partnership Agreement, the security holders
referred to herein may have influence over the Company.  Although these security holders have not
agreed to act together on any matter, they would be in a position to exercise
even more influence over the Company’s affairs if they were to act together in
the future.  This influence could
conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of
other security holders.  For additional
information regarding the security ownership of our trustees, including Mr. Zell,
and our executive officers, see the Company

’

s
definitive proxy statement.

Shareholders’ Ability to Effect
Changes in Control of the Company is Limited

Provisions of Our Declaration
of Trust and Bylaws Could Inhibit Changes in Control

Certain
provisions of our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws may delay or prevent a change
in control of the Company or other transactions that could provide the security
holders with a premium over the then-prevailing market price of their
securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security
holders.  This includes the 5% Ownership
Limit described below.  Also, any future
series of preferred shares of beneficial interest may have certain voting
provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or other
transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders.

We Have a Share Ownership
Limit for REIT Tax Purposes

To
remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50%
in value of our outstanding Shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by
five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year.  To facilitate maintenance of our REIT
qualification, our Declaration of Trust, subject to certain exceptions,
prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5% of the lesser of
the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred
shares.  We refer to this restriction as
the

“

Ownership Limit.

”

Absent any exemption or waiver granted by our Board of Trustees,
securities acquired or held in violation of the Ownership Limit will be
transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary,
and the security holder

’

s rights to
distributions and to vote would terminate. 
A transfer of Shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the
Ownership Limit.  The Ownership Limit
could delay or prevent a change in control and, therefore, could adversely
affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the
then-prevailing market price for their Shares. 
To


reduce the ability of the Board to use the
Ownership Limit as an anti-takeover device, in 2004 the Company amended the
Ownership Limit to require, rather than permit, the Board to grant a waiver of
the Ownership Limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such
ownership would not jeopardize the Company’s status as a REIT.

Our Preferred Shares May Affect
Changes in Control

Our
Declaration of Trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to issue up to 100
million preferred shares, and to establish the preferences and rights
(including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares) of
any preferred shares issued.  The Board
of Trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms
of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even
if a change in control were in the interest of security holders.

Inapplicability of
Maryland Law Limiting Certain Changes in Control

Certain
provisions of Maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit

“

business combinations

”

(including certain issuances of equity
securities) with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the
voting power of outstanding securities, or with an affiliate who, at any time
within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial
owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding
voting securities (an

“

Interested
Shareholder

”

), or with an affiliate
of an Interested Shareholder.  These
prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the
Interested Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder.  After the five-year period, a business
combination with an Interested Shareholder must be approved by two
super-majority shareholder votes unless, among other conditions, holders of
common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is
received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the Interested
Shareholder for its common shares.  As
permitted by Maryland law, however, the Board of Trustees of the Company has opted
out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving Mr. Zell
and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them.  Consequently, the five-year prohibition and
the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination
involving us and/or any of them. Such business combinations may not be in the
best interest of our security holders.

Our Success as a REIT Is
Dependent on Compliance with Federal Income Tax Requirements

Our Failure to Qualify as
a REIT Would Have Serious Adverse Consequences to Our Security Holders

We
believe that we have qualified for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes since our taxable year ended December 31, 1992 based, in part,
upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities
or engaged in significant merger transactions. 
We plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a
REIT.  Many of these requirements,
however, are highly technical and complex. 
We cannot, therefore, guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify
in the future as a REIT.  The
determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual
matters that may not be totally within our control.  For example, to qualify as a REIT, our gross
income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related
sources that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. 
We are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90% of
our REIT taxable income excluding capital gains.  The fact that we hold our assets through ERP Operating
Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of
the REIT requirements.  Even a technical
or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status.  Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make
changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings
that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a
REIT.  We do not believe, however, that
any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our REIT status.

If
we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax at
regular corporate rates.  Also, unless
the IRS granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would remain
disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year we first failed to
qualify.  If we fail to qualify as a


REIT, we would have to pay significant income
taxes.  We, therefore, would have less
money available for investments or for distributions to security holders.  This would likely have a significant adverse
affect on the value of our securities. 
In addition, we would no longer be required to make any distributions to
security holders.  Even if we qualify as
a REIT, we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and
local taxes on our income and property. 
In addition, our corporate housing business and condominium conversion
business, which are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, generally will
be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they
have taxable income.

We Could Be Disqualified
as a REIT or Have to Pay Taxes if Our Merger Partners Did Not Qualify as REITs

If
any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a REIT throughout the
duration of their existence, then they might have had undistributed

“

C corporation earnings and profits

”

at the time of their merger with
us.  If that was the case and we did not
distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the
merger took place, we might not qualify as a REIT.  We believe based, in part, upon opinions of
legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well
as our own investigations, among other things, that each of our prior merger
partners qualified as a REIT and that, in any event, none of them had any
undistributed

“

C corporation
earnings and profits

”

at the time of
their merger with us.  If any of our
prior merger partners failed to qualify as a REIT, an additional concern would
be that they would have recognized taxable gain at the time they merged with
us.  We would be liable for the tax on
such gain.  In this event, we would have
to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable
merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years
of the merger.  Finally, we could be
precluded from electing REIT status for up to four years after the year in
which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for REIT status.

Compliance with REIT Distribution
Requirements May Affect Our Financial Condition

Distribution Requirements May Increase
the Indebtedness of the Company

We
may be required from time to time, under certain circumstances, to accrue as
income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received.  In such event, or upon our repayment of
principal on debt, we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to
enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a REIT.  Accordingly, we could be required to borrow
funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these
distribution requirements.

Tax Elections Regarding Distributions May Impact Future Liquidity of
the Company

Under certain
circumstances, we may make a tax election to treat future distributions to
shareholders as distributions in the current year.  This election, which is provided for in the
REIT tax code, may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying
additional income taxes in the current year. 
However, this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease
our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the
REIT distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability.

Federal
Income Tax Considerations

General

The
following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material
to a holder of common shares.  It is not
exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. 
For example, it does not give a detailed discussion of any state, local
or foreign tax considerations.  The following
discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to
prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances.  Moreover, it does not address all tax matters
that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under
the tax laws, such as insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial
institutions or broker-dealers, foreign corporations and persons who are not
citizens or residents of the United States.

The
specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material
impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase, ownership and
disposition of common shares.  Therefore,
it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own
tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to
the shareholder

’

s personal tax
situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state,
local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

The
information in this section is based on the current Internal Revenue Code,
current, temporary


and proposed Treasury regulations, the
legislative history of the Internal Revenue Code, current administrative
interpretations and practices of the Internal Revenue Service, including its
practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings, which are not
binding on the Internal Revenue Service, and existing court decisions.  Future legislation, regulations,
administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or
adversely affect existing interpretations of current law.  Any change could apply retroactively.  Thus, it is possible that the Internal Revenue
Service could challenge the statements in this discussion, which do not bind
the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and that a court could agree with
the Internal Revenue Service.

Our Taxation

We elected REIT status
beginning with the year that ended December 31, 1992.  In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, we
generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT
taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders.  This treatment substantially eliminates the
double taxation that applies to most corporations, which pay a tax on their
income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on
the amount they receive.  We elected
taxable REIT subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries,
primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities.  As a result, we will be subject to federal
income taxes for activities performed by our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

We will be subject to
federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our REIT taxable income or
capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders.  In addition, we will be subject to a 4%
excise tax if we do not satisfy specific REIT distribution requirements.  We could also be subject to the

“

alternative minimum tax

”

on our items of tax preference.  In addition, any net income from

“

prohibited transactions

”

(i.e., dispositions of property, other
than property held by a taxable REIT subsidiary, held primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of business) will be subject to a 100%
tax.  We could also be subject to a 100%
penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted
by a taxable REIT subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the
Internal Revenue Service.  If we fail to
satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (described
below) but have maintained our qualification as a REIT because we satisfied
certain other requirements, we will still generally be subject to a 100%
penalty tax on the amount by which we fail such gross income test.  If we fail to satisfy any of the REIT asset
tests (described below) by more than a

de minimis

amount, due to reasonable cause, and we nonetheless maintain our REIT
qualification because of specified cure provisions, we will be required to pay
a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate
multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets.  If we fail to satisfy any provision of the
Internal Revenue Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT
(other than a violation of the REIT gross income or asset tests described
below) and the violation is due to reasonable cause, we may retain our REIT
qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such
failure. Moreover, we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on
certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate.

We
believe that we have qualified as a REIT for all of our taxable years beginning
with 1992.  We also believe that our
current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to
qualify as a REIT.  However, given the
complexity of the REIT qualification requirements, we cannot provide any
assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will
satisfy the requirements under the Internal Revenue Code for a particular year.

If
we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and the relief
provisions described herein do not apply, we will be subject to tax on our
taxable income at regular corporate rates. 
We also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax.”  As a result, our failure to qualify as a REIT
would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our
shareholders.  Unless entitled to
statutory relief, we would be disqualified as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year during which qualification was lost.  It is not possible to state whether we would
be entitled to statutory relief.

Our qualification and
taxation as a REIT depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements


under the Internal Revenue
Code.  We are required to satisfy these
requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other
results.  Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to
remain qualified as a REIT.

Ownership
of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries by Us

.  The Internal Revenue Code provides that REITs
may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the
securities of

“

taxable REIT
subsidiaries

”

or

“

TRSs

”

,
which are corporations subject to tax as a regular

“

C

”

corporation that
have elected, jointly with a REIT, to be a TRS. 
Generally, a taxable REIT subsidiary may own assets that cannot
otherwise be owned by a REIT and can perform impermissible tenant services
(discussed above), which would otherwise taint our rental income under the REIT
income tests.  However, the REIT will be
obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain
expenses deducted by our TRSs if the economic arrangements between us, our
tenants and the TRS are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated
parties.  A TRS may also receive income
from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100% federal income tax
liability imposed to REITs.  Income from
prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land, the purchase
and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units.

TRSs pay federal and state
income tax at the full applicable corporate rates.  The amount of taxes paid on impermissible
tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount.  The TRSs will attempt to minimize the amount
of these taxes, but we cannot guarantee whether, or the extent to which,
measures taken to minimize these taxes will be successful.  To the extent that these companies are
required to pay taxes, less cash may be available for distributions to
shareholders.

Share
Ownership Test and Organizational Requirement

.

In order to qualify as a
REIT, our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100
persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months, or during a
proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months.  Also, not more than 50% in value of our
shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying
certain constructive ownership rules, by five or fewer individuals during the
last half of each taxable year.  In
addition, we must meet certain other organizational requirements, including,
but not limited to, that (i) the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced
by transferable shares and (ii) we are managed by one or more trustees.  We believe that we have satisfied all of
these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue
to do so in the future.  In order to
ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50% share ownership test
discussed above, we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our
shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share
ownership.  However, such restrictions
may not prevent us from failing these requirements, and thereby failing to
qualify as a REIT.

Gross
Income Tests

.  To qualify
as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income tests:

(1)

At least 75% of
our gross income for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly
from rents from real property, investments in real estate and/or real estate
mortgages, dividends paid by another REIT and from some types of temporary
investments.

(2)

At least 95% of
our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from any combination of
income qualifying under the 75% test and dividends, non-real estate mortgage
interest, some payments under hedging instruments and gain from the sale or
disposition of stock or securities.

To qualify as rents from
real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests, rental
payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on
the net income of the resident.  Also,
the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15% of the total
rent.  We may generally provide services
to residents without

“

tainting

”

our rental income only if such services
are

“

usually or customarily rendered

”

in connection with the rental of real
property and not otherwise considered

“

impermissible
services

”

.  If such services are impermissible, then we
may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount, or
are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue
and that meets other requirements, or through a taxable REIT subsidiary.


We believe that services
provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in
connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered
impermissible, or, if considered impermissible services, will meet the

de minimis

test or will be provided by an independent
contractor or taxable REIT subsidiary. 
However, we cannot provide any assurance that the Internal Revenue
Service will agree with these positions.

If we fail to satisfy one or
both of the gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless
qualify as a REIT for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. 
In this case, a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed
above.  Generally, it is not possible to
state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these
relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply, we
will not qualify as a REIT.

Asset
Tests

.  In general, at the close of
each quarter of our taxable year, we must satisfy four tests relating to the
nature of our assets:

(1)

At least 75% of the value of our total assets
must be represented by real estate assets (which include for this purpose
shares in other real estate investment trusts) and certain cash related items;

(2)     Not more than 25% of our
total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the

75%
asset class;

(3)

Except for equity investments in other REITs,
qualified REIT subsidiaries (i.e., corporations owned 100% by a REIT that are
not TRSs or REITs), or taxable REIT subsidiaries: (a) the value of any one
issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our total
assets and (b) we may not own more than 10% of the value of or the voting
securities of any one issuer; and

(4)

Not more than 20% of our
total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT
subsidiaries.

The
10% value test described in clause (b) of (3) above does not apply to
certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the Code.  Under the safe harbor, the following are not
considered

“

securities

”

held by us for purposes of this 10%
value test: (i) straight debt securities, (ii) any loan of an
individual or an estate, (iii) certain rental agreements for the use of
tangible property, (iv) any obligation to pay rents from real property, (v) any
security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof, foreign
government or Puerto Rico only if the determination of any payment under such
security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any
obligation issued by such other entity, or (vi) any security issued by a
REIT.  The timing and payment of interest
or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a
contingency provided that (A) such contingency does not change the
effective yield to maturity, not considering a

de minimis

change which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of 1% or 5% of the annual yield
to maturity or we own $1,000,000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value
of the particular issuer’s debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued
interest can be required to be prepaid or (B) the contingency is
consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a
default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt.  If we hold indebtedness from any issuer,
including a REIT, the indebtedness will be subject to, and may cause a
violation of, the asset tests, unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise
satisfies the above safe harbor.  We
currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be
taxed as REITs for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly
traded.  If any such entity were to fail
to qualify as a REIT, we would not meet the 10% voting stock limitation and the
10% value limitation and we would fail to qualify as a REIT.  We believe that we and each of the REITs we
own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for REIT
qualification.  However, we cannot
provide any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with our
determinations.

If
we fail to satisfy the 5% or 10% asset tests described above after a 30-day
cure period provided in the Internal Revenue Code, we will be deemed to have
met such tests if the value of our non-qualifying assets is

de minimis

(i.e., does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the
total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or $10,000,000)
and we dispose of the non-qualifying assets within six months after the


last day of the quarter in which the failure
to satisfy the asset tests is discovered. 
For violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are
in excess of the

de minimis

exception described
above, we may avoid disqualification as a REIT under any of the asset tests,
after the 30-day cure period, by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the
asset test within such six month period, paying a tax equal to the greater of
$50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income
generated by the non-qualifying assets and disclosing certain information to
the Internal Revenue Service.  If we
cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions, or if we fail to timely cure
any noncompliance with the asset tests, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.

Annual
Distribution Requirements

.  To
qualify as a REIT, we are generally required to distribute dividends, other
than capital gain dividends, to our shareholders each year in an amount at
least equal to 90% of our REIT taxable income. 
These distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which
they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file
our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular
dividend payment date after the declaration is made.  We intend to make timely distributions
sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements.  To the extent that we do not distribute all
of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our
REIT taxable income, as adjusted, we are subject to tax on these amounts at
regular corporate rates.  We will be
subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the
sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal
income tax was paid, if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at
least the sum of:  (1) 85% of our
REIT ordinary income for the year; (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net
income for the year; and (3) any undistributed taxable income from prior
taxable years.  A REIT may elect to
retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay
the tax on the gains.  In that case, a
REIT may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of
the undistributed net capital gains in income as long-term capital gains and
receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the REIT.  For purposes of the 4% excise tax described
above, any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed.

Ownership
of Partnership Interests By Us

.  As a result of our ownership of the Operating
Partnership, we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of
the assets and items of income of the Operating Partnership, respectively, for
purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, including its share of assets and
items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability
companies.

State
and Local Taxes

.  We may be
subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions, including those in
which we transact business or reside. 
Our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income
tax treatment discussed above.  Consequently,
prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the
effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares.

Taxation of Domestic Shareholders Subject to U.S. Tax

General

.  If we qualify as a REIT, distributions made
to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares, other
than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable REIT
subsidiaries, will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the
distributions come out of earnings and profits. 
These distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received
deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute

“

qualified dividend income

”

under the Internal Revenue Code, meaning
that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary
income rather than the special capital gain rates applicable to qualified
dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding
period requirements.  In determining
whether distributions are out of earnings and profits, we will allocate our
earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common
shares.  The portion of ordinary
dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a TRS, will be
designated as

“

qualified dividend
income

”

to REIT shareholders and are
eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our non-corporate shareholders.

To the extent we make
distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings


and profits, such distributions will be
considered a return of capital.  Such
distributions will be treated as a tax-free distribution and will reduce the
tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so
treated.  To the extent such
distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis;
such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of shares.  Shareholders may not include in their
individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital
losses.

Dividends
declared by a REIT in October, November, or December are deemed to have
been paid by the REIT and received by its shareholders on December 31 of
that year, so long as the dividends are actually paid during January of
the following year.  However, this
treatment only applies to the extent of the REIT

’

s earnings and profits existing on December 31.  To the extent the shareholder distribution
paid in January exceeds available earnings and profits as of December 31,
the excess is treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year
paid.  As such, for tax reporting
purposes, January distributions paid to our shareholders may be split
between two tax years.

Distributions
made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable
to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital
asset held for more than one year.  This
treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not
exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year.  It applies regardless of the period for which
a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares.  Despite this general rule, corporate
shareholders may be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain
dividends as ordinary income.

Generally,
we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a 15%
rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured Section 1250
gain distribution.  A 15% rate gain
distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are
individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 15%.  An unrecaptured Section 1250 gain
distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are
individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25%.

If,
for any taxable year, we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any
portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all
classes of shares of beneficial interest, then the portion of the capital gains
dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the
total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction.  The numerator of the fraction will be the
total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for
the year.  The denominator of the
fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all
classes of shares of beneficial interest.

We
may elect to retain (rather than distribute as is generally required) net
capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain.  If we make this election, shareholders must
include in income, as long-term capital gain, their proportionate share of the
undistributed net capital gain. 
Shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of
the tax paid by us on these gains. 
Accordingly, they will receive a tax credit or refund for the
amount.  Shareholders will increase the
basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital
gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as
having paid.  Our earnings and profits
will be adjusted appropriately.

In
general, a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal
to the difference between:

(a)

the amount of cash and the
fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition;
and

(b)

the shareholder’s adjusted
tax basis in the common shares.

The
gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a
capital asset.  Generally, the capital
gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the common shares were
held for more than one year.

In
general, a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that
were held for


six months or less, determined after applying
certain holding period rules, will be treated as long-term capital loss to the
extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as
long-term capital gains.  For
shareholders who are individuals, trusts and estates, the long-term capital
loss will be apportioned among the applicable long-term capital gain rates to
the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so
treated.

Taxation of Domestic Tax-Exempt Shareholders

Most
tax-exempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the
extent of their unrelated business taxable income, which is often referred to
as UBTI.  Unless a tax-exempt shareholder
holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in
an unrelated trade or business, distributions to the shareholder should not
constitute UBTI.  Similarly, if a
tax-exempt shareholder sells common shares, the income from the sale should not
constitute UBTI unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed
property or used the shares in a trade or business.

However,
for tax-exempt shareholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit
associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified group
legal services plans, income from owning or selling common shares will
constitute UBTI unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set
aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its
investment in common shares.  These
shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside
and reserve requirements which are set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.

In
addition, certain pension trusts that own more than 10% of a

“

pension-held REIT

”

must report a portion of the distributions that they receive
from the REIT as UBTI.  We have not been
and do not expect to be treated as a pension-held REIT for purposes of this
rule.

Taxation of Foreign Shareholders

The
following is a discussion of certain anticipated United States federal income
tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable
to a foreign shareholder.  For purposes
of this discussion, a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than:

(a)

a citizen or resident of the
United States;

(b)

a corporation or partnership
created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United
States or of any state thereof; or

(c)

an estate or trust whose
income is includable in gross income for United States federal income tax
purposes regardless of its source.

Distributions
by Us

. 
Distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither
attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of United States real
property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be
treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of
our earnings and profits.  These
distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of United States
federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30% rate, or a lower treaty rate,
unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by
the foreign shareholder of a United States trade or business.  Please note that under certain treaties lower
withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends
from REITs.  Dividends that are
effectively connected with a United States trade or business will be subject to
tax on a net basis at graduated rates, and are generally not subject to withholding.  Certification and disclosure requirements
must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this
exemption.  A foreign shareholder that is
a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30%
rate or a lower treaty rate.

We
expect to withhold United States income tax at the rate of 30% on any
distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless:


(a)

a lower treaty rate applies
and any required form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced
rate is filed with us; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder
files an IRS Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the distribution is
effectively connected income.

A
distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will
not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution
does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares.  Instead, the distribution will reduce the
adjusted basis of the common shares.  To
the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common
shares, it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s
common shares.  The tax treatment of this
gain is described below.

We
intend to withhold at a rate of 30%, or a lower applicable treaty rate, on the
entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain
distribution.  In such event, a foreign
shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the IRS if it
subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in excess of our
earnings and profits, and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s
United States tax liability with respect to the distribution.

Any
capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is

“

regularly traded

”

on an established securities market, will be treated as an
ordinary dividend described above, if the foreign shareholder did not own more
than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year.  Foreign shareholders generally will not be
required to report distributions received from us on U.S. federal income tax
returns and all distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, including any capital gain dividends, will be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax (unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax
treaty), as described above.  In
addition, the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions.

Distributions
to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as
capital gain dividends, other than those arising from the disposition of a
United States real property interest, generally will not be subject to United
States federal income taxation unless:

(a)

the investment in the common
shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s United States
trade or business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the
same treatment as domestic shareholders, except that a shareholder that is a
foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax, as discussed
above; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder is a
nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days
or more during the taxable year and has a

“

tax
home

”

in the United States, in which
case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the
individual’s capital gains.

Except
as described above, under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act,
which is known as FIRPTA, distributions to a foreign shareholder that are
attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of United States real property
interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the
gain as income effectively connected with a United States trade or business.  This rule applies whether or not a
distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend.  Accordingly, foreign shareholders generally
would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to U.S.
shareholders, subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of
nonresident alien individuals.  In
addition, a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch
profits tax discussed above.  We are
required to withhold 35% of these distributions.  The withheld amount can be credited against the
foreign shareholder’s United States federal income tax liability.

Although
the law is not entirely clear on the matter, it appears that amounts we
designate as


undistributed capital gains in respect of the
common shares held by U.S. shareholders would be treated with respect to
foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain
dividends. Under that approach, foreign shareholders would be able to offset as
a credit against the United States federal income tax liability their
proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital
gains.  In addition, foreign shareholders
would be able to receive from the IRS a refund to the extent their
proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual United
States federal income tax liability.

Foreign
Shareholders’ Sales of Common Shares

.  Gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon
the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to United
States taxation unless the shares constitute a “United States real property
interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA. 
The common shares will not constitute a United States real property
interest so long as we are a domestically controlled REIT.  A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in
which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of
its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders.  We believe that we are a domestically
controlled REIT.  Therefore, we believe
that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under
FIRPTA.  However, because common shares
and preferred shares are publicly traded, we cannot guarantee that we will
continue to be a domestically controlled REIT. 
In any event, gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not
otherwise subject to FIRPTA will be subject to U.S. tax, if either:

(a)

the investment in the common
shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder

’

s United States trade or business, in which
case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic
shareholders with respect to the gain; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder is a
nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days
or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the United States, in
which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the
individual’s capital gains.

Even
if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled REIT, gain
arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares
still would not be subject to United States taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of
a United States real property interest if:

(a)

the class or series of
shares being sold is

“

regularly
traded,

”

as defined by applicable
IRS regulations, on an established securities market such as the New York
Stock Exchange; and

(b)

the selling foreign
shareholder owned 5% or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of
shares being sold throughout the five-year period ending on the date of the
sale or exchange.

If
gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under
FIRPTA, the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular United States
income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable U.S.
shareholder, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax, a special
alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the
possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign
corporations.  The purchaser of the
common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 10% of the
purchase price.


Information
Reporting Requirement and Backup Withholding

We will report to our domestic shareholders and the
Internal Revenue Service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar
year and the amount of tax withheld, if any. 
Under certain circumstances, domestic shareholders may be subject to
backup withholding.  Backup withholding
will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain
information to us or the Internal Revenue Service.  Backup withholding will not apply with respect
to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and
tax-exempt organizations.  Domestic
shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their
qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining
such an exemption.  Backup withholding is
not an additional tax.  Rather, the
amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic
shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person

’

s United States federal income tax liability
and may entitle such person to a refund, provided that the required information
is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

Item

None.

Item 2.  Properties

As of December 31,
2007, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding
entities, owned all or a portion of 579 properties in 24 states and the
District of Columbia consisting of 152,821 units.  The Company’s properties are more fully
described as follows:

Resident leases are
generally for twelve months in length and often require security deposits.  The garden-style properties are generally
defined as properties with two and/or three story buildings while the
mid-rise/high-rise are defined as properties with greater than three story buildings.  These two property types typically provide
residents with amenities, which may include a clubhouse, swimming pool, laundry
facilities and cable television access. 
Certain of these properties offer additional amenities such as saunas,
whirlpools, spas, sports courts and exercise rooms or other amenities.  The military housing properties are defined
as those properties located on military bases.

The
distribution of the properties throughout the United States reflects the
Company’s belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio
from regional and economic influences. 
At the same time, the Company has sought to create clusters of
properties within each of its primary markets in order to achieve economies of
scale in management and operation.  The
Company may nevertheless acquire additional multifamily properties located
anywhere in the continental United States.

The following tables set
forth certain information by type and state relating to the Company’s
properties (occupancy information excludes condominium conversion, development
and unstabilized acquired properties) at December 31, 2007:


GARDEN-STYLE PROPERTIES

Item
3.  Legal Proceedings

The Company is party to a
housing discrimination lawsuit brought by a non-profit civil rights
organization in April 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Maryland.  The suit alleges that the
Company designed and built approximately 300 of its properties in violation of
the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act and Americans With
Disabilities Act.  The suit seeks actual
and punitive damages, injunctive relief (including modification of
non-compliant properties), costs and attorneys’ fees.  The Company believes it has a number of
viable defenses, including that a majority of the named properties were
completed before the operative dates of the statutes in question and/or were
not designed or built by the Company. 
Accordingly, the Company is defending the suit vigorously.  Due to the pendency of the Company’s defenses
and the uncertainty of many other critical factual and legal issues, it is not
possible to determine or predict the outcome of the suit and as a result, no
amounts have been accrued at December, 31, 2007.  While no assurances can be given, the Company
does not believe that the suit, if adversely determined, would have a material
adverse effect on the Company.

The Company does not believe
there is any other litigation pending or threatened against it that,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably may be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Company.

The following table sets
forth, for the years indicated, the high, low and closing sales prices for and
the distributions paid on the Company’s Common Shares, which trade on the New
York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol EQR.

The number of record holders of Common Shares at January 31, 2008
was approximately 4,000.  The number of
outstanding Common Shares as of January 31, 2008 was 269,644,705.

Common Shares Repurchased in the Quarter Ended December 31, 2007

The Company repurchased the following Common
Shares during the quarter ended December 31, 2007:

(1)

The
  Common Shares repurchased during the quarter ended December 31, 2007
  represent Common Shares repurchased under the Company’s publicly announced
  share repurchase program approved by its Board of Trustees. All shares were
  repurchased in the open market. As of December 31, 2007, transactions to
  repurchase 125,000 of the 2,390,000 Common Shares had not yet settled. On
  April 27, May 24, and December 3, 2007, the Board of Trustees
  approved an increase of $200.1 million, an additional $500.0 million and an
  additional $500.0 million, respectively, to the Company’s authorized share
  repurchase program. Considering the above additional authorizations and the
  repurchase activity for the quarter, the Company has authorization to
  repurchase an additional $475.6 million of its shares as of December 31,
  2007.


Equity Compensation Plan
Information

The following table
provides information as of December 31, 2007 with respect to

the Company’s Common Shares that may be issued
under its existing equity compensation plans.

The aggregate number of securities available
for issuance (inclusive of restricted shares previously granted and outstanding
and shares underlying outstanding options) under the 2002 Plan equals 7.5% of
the Company

’s outstanding Common Shares, calculated on a fully diluted basis,
determined annually on the first day of each calendar year.  On January 1, 2008, this amount equaled
21,631,555, of which 10,392,101 shares were available for future issuance.

Item 6.  Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth selected financial and operating
information on a historical basis for the Company.  The following information should be read in
conjunction with all of the financial statements and notes thereto included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  The
historical operating and balance sheet data have been derived from the
historical financial statements of the Company. 
All amounts have also been restated in accordance with the discontinued
operations provisions of SFAS No. 144. 
Certain capitalized terms as used herein are defined in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.


CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL
INFORMATION

(Financial information in
thousands except for per share and property data)

(1)  The National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from
operations (“FFO”) (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(“GAAP”)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus
depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships
and joint ventureswill be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the
same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales
of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating
properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to
condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. FFO
available to Common Shares and OP Units is calculated on a basis consistent
with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net
income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred
shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that
contributed their properties to


the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are
collectively referred to as the “Minority Interests - Operating Partnership”.
Subject to certain restrictions, the Minority Interests - Operating Partnership
may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. See
Item 7 for a reconciliation of net income to FFO and FFO available to Common
Shares and OP Units.

(2)  The Company
believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units are helpful
to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real
estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real
estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of
depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary
among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost
accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares
and OP Units can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real
estate between periods or as compared to different companies.  FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP
Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net
cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.  Therefore, FFO and FFO available to Common
Shares and OP Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net
income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating
activities as determined by GAAP or as measures of liquidity.  The Company’s calculation of FFO and FFO
available to Common Shares and OP Units may differ from other real estate
companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies
for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other
real estate companies.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The following discussion and
analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company
should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
Notes thereto.  Due to the Company’s
ability to control the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries other than
entities owning interests in the Partially Owned Properties - Unconsolidated
and certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating
Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the
Company for financial reporting purposes. 
Capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as defined elsewhere
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2007.

Forward-looking statements
in this Item 7 as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are
intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
These statements are based on current expectations, estimates,
projections and assumptions made by management. 
While the Company’s management believes the assumptions underlying its
forward-looking statements are reasonable, such information is inherently
subject to uncertainties and may involve certain risks, which could cause
actual results, performance, or achievements of the Company to differ
materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Many of these uncertainties and risks are
difficult to predict and beyond management’s control.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees
of future performance, results or events. 
The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking
statements because of subsequent events. 
Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited
to, the following:

·

We intend to
actively acquire and develop multifamily properties for rental operations
and/or conversion into condominiums, as well as upgrade and sell existing
properties as individual condominiums. 
We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired or
development property up to standards established for its intended market
position.  Additionally, we expect that
other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us
for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in
markets where we focus our development efforts. 
This competition may increase prices for multifamily properties or
decrease the price at which we expect to sell individual properties.  We may not be in a position or have the
opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable
terms.  We also plan to develop more
properties ourselves in addition to co-investing with our development partners
for either the rental or condominium market, depending on opportunities in each
sub-market.  This may increase the
overall level of risk associated with our developments.  The total number of development units, cost
of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties
arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and
construction materials), competition and local government regulation;


·

Sources of
capital to the Company or labor and materials required for maintenance, repair,
capital expenditure or development are more expensive than anticipated;

·

Occupancy
levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local
economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new construction
of multifamily housing, slow employment growth, availability of low interest
mortgages for single-family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical
instability, all of which are beyond the Company’s control; and

·

Additional
factors as discussed in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
particularly those under

“

Risk
Factors

”

.

Readers are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as
of the date hereof.  The Company
undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these
forward-looking statements, which may be made to reflect events or
circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events.  Forward-looking
statements and related uncertainties are also included in Notes 5 and 11 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Results of
Operations

In
conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy, the Company
has continued to invest or recycle its capital investment in apartment
properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended December 31,
2007 and December 31, 2006.  In
summary, we:

Year
Ended December 31, 2007:

·

Acquired
$1.7 billion of apartment properties consisting of 36 properties and 8,167
units, and $212.8 million of land parcels, all of which we deem to be in our
strategic targeted markets; and

·

Sold
$1.9 billion of apartment properties consisting of 73 properties and 21,563
units, as well as 617 condominium units for $164.2 million and $50.0 million of
land parcels.

Year
Ended December 31, 2006:

·

Acquired
$1.8 billion of apartment properties consisting of 35 properties and 8,768
units, and $134.4 million of land parcels, all of which we deem to be in our
strategic targeted markets; and

·

Sold
$2.3 billion of apartment properties consisting of 335 properties and 39,608
units, as well as 1,069 condominium units for $216.0 million and $1.6 million
of land parcels.

On June 28, 2006, the
Company announced that it agreed to sell its Lexford Housing Division for a
cash purchase price of $1.086 billion. 
The sale closed on October 5, 2006. 
The Lexford Housing Division results are classified as discontinued operations,
net of minority interests, in the consolidated statements of operations for all
periods presented.  The Company recorded
a gain on sale of approximately $418.7 million on the sale of the Lexford
Housing Division in the fourth quarter of 2006. 
In conjunction with the Lexford disposition, the Company paid
off/extinguished $196.3 million of mortgage notes payable secured by the
properties and incurred approximately $9.2 million in prepayment penalties upon
extinguishment.

The
Company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment
communities is net operating income (

“

NOI

”

).  NOI represents rental income
less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense
and property management expense.  The
Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of
the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct
measure of the actual operating results of the Company’s apartment communities.

Properties that the Company
owned for all of both 2007 and 2006 (the

“

Same Store Properties

”

), which
represented 115,857 units, impacted the Company’s results of operations.  Properties that the Company owned for all of
both 2006 and 2005 (the “2006 Same Store Properties”), which


represented 128,133 units, also impacted the
Company’s results of operations.  Both
the 2007 Same Store Properties and 2006 Same Store Properties are discussed in
the following paragraphs.

The Company’s acquisition, disposition, completed
development and consolidation of previously unconsolidated property activities
also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2006.  The impacts of these
activities are also discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.

Comparison of the year ended December 31,
2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006

For
the year ended December 31, 2007, income from continuing operations, net
of minority interests, increased by approximately $41.1 million when compared
to the year ended December 31, 2006. 
The increase in continuing operations is discussed below.

Revenues
from the 2007 Same Store Properties increased $67.2 million primarily as a
result of higher rental rates charged to residents.  Expenses from the 2007 Same Store Properties
increased $12.6 million primarily due to higher payroll, building, utility
costs, insurance and real estate taxes. 
The following tables provide comparative same store results and
statistics for the 2007 Same Store Properties:

(1) Average rental rate is defined as total rental revenues
divided by the weighted average occupied units for the period.

The following table presents a reconciliation of
operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to NOI for the
2007 Same Store Properties.

For properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2007
and expects to continue to own through December 31, 2008, the Company
anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending December 31,
2008:


These 2008 assumptions are based on current
expectations and are forward-looking.

Non-same store operating results increased $106.1 million and consist
primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2007 and 2006 as well as operations
from completed development properties and our corporate housing business.

See also Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Company’s segment
disclosures.

Fee
and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses,
increased $0.6 million primarily as a result of an increase in property
management fees from unconsolidated entities along with a decrease in asset
management expenses from managing fewer properties for third parties and
unconsolidated entities.  As of December 31,
2007 and 2006, the Company managed 14,472 units and 15,020 units, respectively, primarily for
unconsolidated entities and our military housing venture at Fort Lewis.

Property
management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses
associated with the self-management of the Company’s properties as well as
management fees paid to any third party management companies.  These expenses decreased by approximately
$8.8 million or 9.1%.  This decrease is
primarily attributable to lower overall payroll costs, various reserve
adjustments for workers compensation and medical costs and lower training costs
associated with the completion of a majority of the rollout of a new property
management system, partially offset by higher legal and professional fees.

Depreciation
expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real
estate assets, increased $80.1 million primarily as a result of additional
depreciation expense on newly acquired properties and capital expenditures for
all properties owned.

General and
administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate
operating expenses, increased

approximately

$0.8 million between the periods under comparison.  This increase was primarily due to an
increase in restricted share expense and severance costs associated with the
resignation of two of the Company’s executives as well as less expense recovery
related to a certain lawsuit in Florida (see Note 21), partially offset by a
decrease in profit sharing and state and franchise taxes.  The Company anticipates that general and
administrative expenses will approximate $48.0 million to $50.0 million for the
year ending December 31, 2008.  The
above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.

Impairment

from continuing operations decreased
$32.6 million primarily due to an impairment charge on goodwill of $30.0
million taken in 2006 related to the corporate housing business.  In addition, in 2006 the Company wrote-off
$2.0 million of various deferred sales costs following the decision to halt the
condominium conversion and sale process at five assets.

Interest and other income from continuing operations
decreased approximately $10.8

million primarily as a result
of $14.7 million of forfeited deposits for various terminated transactions
along with $3.7 million in proceeds from eBay’s acquisition of Rent.com
received during the year ended December 31, 2006. This was partially
offset by $4.1 million received in 2007 for insurance litigation settlement
proceeds, a $2.7 million increase in interest earned on 1031 exchange and
earnest money deposits and a $0.7 million increase in interest earned on
short-term investments.  The Company
anticipates that interest and other income will approximate $5.0 million to
$10.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2008.  The above assumption is based on current
expectations and is forward-looking.


Interest
expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred
financing costs, increased approximately $67.4 million primarily as a result of higher overall debt levels
outstanding due to the Company’s share repurchase activity as well as the
timing of acquisitions and dispositions, partially offset by lower overall
effective interest rates.  During the
year ended December 31, 2007, the Company capitalized interest costs of
approximately $45.1 million as compared to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2006.  This capitalization of interest
primarily relates to consolidated projects under development.  The effective interest cost on all
indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 5.96% as compared to
6.21% for the year ended December 31, 2006.  The Company anticipates that interest expense
(including discontinued operations) will approximate $470.0 million to $490.0
million for the year ending December 31, 2008.  The above assumption is based on current
expectations and is forward-looking.

Income

from

investments in unconsolidated
entities increased approximately $1.0 million between the periods under
comparison.  This increase is primarily
due to the sale of the Company’s 7.075% ownership interest in Wellsford Park
Highlands Corporation, an entity which owns a condominium development in
Denver, Colorado and profit participation received from the sale of condominium
units at  a development project that was
sold in 2003.

Net gain on sales of
unconsolidated entities increased $2.3 million primarily as a result of a $2.6
million gain on the sale of an unconsolidated institutional joint venture
property during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Net gain on

sales

of land parcels increased $3.6
million primarily as a result of higher net gains realized in 2007 on the sales
of land parcels compared to the net gains realized in 2006.

Discontinued
operations, net of minority interests, decreased approximately $124.3 million
between the periods under comparison. 
This decrease is primarily due to a significant decrease in the number
of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the
same period in 2006, as well as the mix of properties sold in each year.  See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion.

Comparison of the year ended December 31,
2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005

For
the year ended December 31, 2006, income from continuing operations, net
of minority interests, decreased by approximately $54.6 million when compared
to the year ended December 31, 2005. 
The decrease in continuing operations is discussed below.

Revenues
from the 2006 Same Store Properties increased $88.7 million primarily as a
result of higher rental rates charged to residents.  Expenses from the 2006 Same Store Properties
increased $23.9 million primarily due to higher maintenance, payroll, utility
costs and real estate taxes.  The
following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the
2006 Same Store Properties:

Non-same
store operating results increased $151.0 million and consist primarily of
properties acquired in calendar years 2006 and 2005 as well as our corporate
housing business.

See
also Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
discussion regarding the Company

’

s segment disclosures.

Fee
and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses
decreased $1.5 million primarily as a result of lower income earned from
managing fewer properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities.  As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company
managed 15,020 units and 16,269
units, respectively, primarily for unconsolidated entities and our military
housing venture at Fort Lewis.

Property
management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses
associated with the self-management of the Company’s properties as well as
management fees paid to any third party management companies.  These expenses increased by approximately
$9.3 million or 10.7%.  This increase is
primarily attributable to higher overall payroll costs and higher overall
computer and training costs specific to the Company’s rollout of a new property
management system.

Depreciation
expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real
estate assets, increased $119.4 million primarily as a result of additional
depreciation expense on newly acquired properties and capital expenditures for
all properties owned.

General and
administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate
operating expenses, decreased approximately $21.9 million between the periods
under comparison.  This decrease was
primarily due to lower executive compensation expense due to severance costs
for several executive officers incurred during the year ended December 31,
2005 and a $2.8 million reimbursement of legal expenses during the year ended December 31,
2006.

Impairment from
continuing operations increased $33.4 million primarily due to an impairment
charge on goodwill of $30.0 million related to the corporate housing business
and $2.0 million related to the write-off of various deferred sales costs
following the decision to halt the condominium conversion and sale process at
five assets.

Interest and other income from continuing operations
decreased by approximately $37.4

million,
primarily as a result of the $57.1 million in cash received during the year
ended December 31, 2005 for the Company’s ownership interest in Rent.com,
which was acquired by eBay, Inc. 
This was partially offset by the $3.7 million in additional proceeds for
Rent.com, an increase in interest earned on tax deferred 1031 exchange proceeds
from the Lexford disposition and $14.7 million of forfeited deposits for
various terminated transactions received during the year ended December 31,
2006.

Interest
expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred
financing costs, increased approximately $67.9 million primarily as a result of higher variable interest rates
and overall debt levels outstanding. 
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company capitalized
interest costs of approximately $20.7 million as compared to $13.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2005. 
This capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated
projects under development.  The
effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31,
2006 was 6.21% as compared to 6.16% for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Loss from investments in
unconsolidated entities increased approximately $1.1 million between the
periods under comparison.  This increase
is primarily the result of consolidating previously unconsolidated properties
as of January 1, 2006 as the result of EITF Issue No. 04-5.

Net

gain on sales of unconsolidated entities
decreased $1.0 million due to increased unconsolidated sales during the year ended
December 31, 2005.


Net gain on sales of land
parcels decreased $27.5 million due to a large gain recorded on the sale of one
land parcel during the year ended December 31, 2005.

Discontinued
operations, net of minority interests, increased approximately $265.6 million
between the periods under comparison. 
This increase is primarily the result of lower real estate net book
values for properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2006 as
compared to the same period in 2005.  See
Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

For the Year Ended December 31,

As
of

January 1,
2007, the Company had approximately $260.3 million of cash and cash equivalents
and $470.7 million available under its revolving credit facilities (net of
$69.3 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and
not available for borrowing).  After
taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following
paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the Company’s
cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2007 was approximately
$50.8 million and the amount available on the Company’s revolving credit
facilities was $1.3 billion (net of $80.8 million which was
restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and not available for
borrowing).

During the year ended December 31,
2007, the Company generated proceeds from various transactions, which included
the following:

·

Disposed of 78 properties, various individual
condominium units and two land parcels, receiving net proceeds of approximately
$2.0 billion;

·

Obtained $346.1 million in net proceeds from the
issuance of $350.0 million of five-year 5.50% fixed rate public notes;

·

Obtained $640.6 million in net proceeds from the
issuance of $650.0 million of ten-year 5.75% fixed rate public notes and
terminated five forward starting swaps designated to hedge the note issuance,
receiving net proceeds of $2.4 million;

·

Obtained a three-year
(subject to two one-year extension options) $500.0 million floating rate term
loan at LIBOR plus a spread (currently 42.5 basis points) dependent upon the
current credit rating on the Operating Partnership’s long-term unsecured debt;

·

Obtained $827.8 million in new mortgage financing; and

·

Issued
approximately 1.2 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $35.9
million.

During the year ended December 31,
2007, the above proceeds were primarily utilized to:

·

Invest $480.2 million primarily in
development projects;

·

Acquire 36 properties and eight land parcels,
utilizing cash of $1.7 billion;

·

Repurchase 27.5 million Common Shares utilizing cash
of $1.2 billion;

·

Repay $548.0 million of mortgage loans;

·

Repay $150.0 million of fixed rate public notes; and

·

Redeem the Series D Preferred Shares at a
liquidation value of $175.0 million.

Depending on its
analysis of market prices, economic conditions, and other opportunities for the
investment of available capital, the Company may repurchase its Common Shares
pursuant to its existing share buyback program authorized by the Board of
Trustees.  On April 27, May 24
and December 3, 2007, the Board of Trustees approved an increase of $200.1
million, an additional $500.0 million and an additional $500.0 million,
respectively, to the Company’s authorized share repurchase program.  As of December 31, 2007 and after giving
effect to the above increases, the Company had authorization to repurchase an
additional $475.6 million of its shares. 
The Company repurchased $1.2 billion (27,484,346 shares at an average
price per share of $44.62) of its Common Shares during the year ended December 31,
2007.  See Note 3 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

As of February 27,
2008, an unlimited amount of debt securities remains available for issuance by
the Operating Partnership under a registration statement that became
automatically effective upon filing with the SEC in June 2006 (under SEC
regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement automatically expires
on


June 29, 2009 and does not contain a maximum issuance amount).   As of February 27, 2008, $956.5 million
in equity securities remains available for issuance by the Company under a
registration statement the SEC declared effective in February 1998.

The Company’s “Consolidated Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization Ratio”
as of December 31, 2007 is presented in the following table.  The Company calculates the equity component
of its market capitalization as the sum of (i) the total outstanding
Common Shares and assumed conversion of all OP Units at the equivalent market value
of the closing price of the Company’s Common Shares on the New York Stock
Exchange; (ii) the “Common Share Equivalent” of all convertible preferred
shares and preference interests/units; and (iii) the liquidation value of
all perpetual preferred shares outstanding.

The Company
expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital
expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain
scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, generally through its
working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under
its revolving credit facilities.  The
Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to
meet operating requirements and payments of distributions.  The Company also expects to meet its
long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage
debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and
development activities and capital improvements through the


issuance
of unsecured notes and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and
proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties as well as joint
ventures.  In addition, the Company has
significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage
borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the
cost of alternative sources of capital is too high.  The fair value of and cash flow from these
unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must
maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line
of credit.  Of the $18.3 billion in
investment in real estate on the Company’s balance sheet at December 31,
2007, $12.0 billion or 65.5%, was unencumbered.

The Operating Partnership’s senior debt credit
ratings from Standard & Poors (

“

S&P

), Moody’s and Fitch are A-, Baal and A-,
respectively.  The Company’s preferred
equity ratings from S&P, Moody

’s

and Fitch are BBB+, Baa2 and BBB+,
respectively.

The Operating
Partnership has a long-term revolving credit facility with potential borrowings
of up to $1.5 billion which

matures in February 2012.  This facility may, among other potential
uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under
development and short term liquidity requirements. As of February 25,
2008, $40.0

million was outstanding under
this facility.

See Note 21 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to December 31,
2007.

Capitalization of Fixed Assets
and Improvements to Real Estate

Our

policy with
respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that
improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset
of the property.  We track improvements
to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories:

·

Replacements

(inside the unit)

.  These include:

·

flooring such
as carpets, hardwood, vinyl, linoleum or tile;

·

appliances;

·

mechanical
equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc;

·

furniture and
fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks,
tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc; and

·

blinds/shades.

All replacements are depreciated over a five-year estimated useful
life.  We expense as incurred all
make-ready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting
of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above.

·

Building
improvements (

outside the unit

).  These include:

·

roof
replacement and major repairs;

·

paving or major
resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks;

·

amenities and
common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies,
clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices;

·

major building
mechanical equipment systems;

·

interior and
exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding;

·

major landscaping and grounds improvement;
and

·

vehicles and
office and maintenance equipment.

All building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten-year
estimated useful life.  We capitalize
building improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $2,500
(selected projects must exceed $10,000); (ii) extends the useful life of
the asset; and (iii) improves the value of the asset.

For the year ended December 31,
2007, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $252.7
million.  This includes the following
(amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):


Capitalized

2006, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $255.2
million.  This includes the following
(amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):

(4)

Includes
properties either Partially Owned or sold during the period, commercial space,
condominium conversions and $21.4 million included in building improvements
spent on seventeen specific assets related to major renovations and
repositioning of these assets.

The Company expects to fund
approximately $104.0

million for capital expenditures for
replacements and building improvements for all established properties,
exclusive of condominium conversion properties, in 2008.  This includes an average of approximately
$1,000 per unit for capital improvements for established properties.

During the year ended December 31,
2007, the Company’s total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer
software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold
improvements to the Company’s property management offices and its corporate
offices, were approximately $7.7

million.  The Company expects to fund approximately
$3.7 million in total additions to non-real estate property in 2008.

Improvements to real estate and
additions to non-real estate property are generally funded from net cash
provided by operating activities.


Derivative Instruments

In the normal course of
business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes.  The Company limits these risks by following
established risk management policies and procedures including the use of
derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.

The Company has a policy of
only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their
credit ratings and other factors.  When
viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the
derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material
loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect
on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of
derivatives.

See
Note 11

in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at December 31,
2007.

Other

Minority
Interests as of December 31, 2007 decreased by $53.4 million when compared
to December 31, 2006, primarily as a result of the following:

·

Distributions
declared to Minority Interests, which amounted to $35.2 million (excluding
Junior Preference Unit and Preference Interest distributions);

·

The allocation
of income from operations to holders of OP Units in the amount of $65.2
million;

·

The conversion
of 230,000 Series J Preference Interests with a liquidation value of $11.5
million into Common Shares; and

·

The conversion
of 1.5 million OP Units into Common Shares valued at $32.4 million.

Total distributions paid in January 2008 amounted to $141.6 million
(excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain
distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

The Company has co-invested in
various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity
method of accounting.  Management does
not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the
Company’s liquidity, cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than
its property management and ownership activities.  During 2000 and 2001, the Company entered
into institutional ventures with an unaffiliated partner.  At the respective closing dates, the Company
sold and/or contributed 45 properties containing 10,846 units to these ventures
and retained a 25% ownership interest in the ventures.  The Company’s joint venture partner
contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed-upon equity value of the properties
comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company.  The Company’s strategy with respect to these
ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of
markets.  See also Note 4 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the sale
of one of these properties containing 400 units.

As of December 31,
2007, the Company has 13 projects totaling 4,185 units in various stages of
development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30,
2010.  The development agreements
currently in place are discussed in detail in Note 18 of the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.

See also Notes 2 and 6 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding
the Company’s investments in partially owned entities.

The following table
summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations for the next five years and
thereafter as of December 31, 2007:

(a)

Amounts include
aggregate principal payments only.  The
Company paid $502,807, $465,388 and $397,886 for interest on debt,

inclusive of derivative instruments, for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The
Company

’s significant accounting
policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.  These policies were followed
in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31,
2007 and are consistent with the year ended December 31, 2006.

The Company has identified six
significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies.  These critical accounting policies are those
that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those
requiring significant judgments and estimates. 
With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes
that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and
produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations
for all periods presented.  The six
critical accounting policies are:


Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets, Including Goodwill

The Company
periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real
estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent impairment.  The judgments regarding the existence of
impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance,
market conditions, expected holding period of each asset and legal and
environmental concerns.  Future events
could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment
indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.

Depreciation of Investment
in Real Estate

The Company
depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a
30-year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5-year to 10-year
estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and
replacements components over a 5-year estimated useful life, all of which are
judgmental determinations.

Cost Capitalization

See the

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to
Real Estate

section for discussion of the policy with respect to
capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs.  In addition, the Company capitalizes the
payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who
spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and/or renovation
projects.  These costs are reflected on
the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.

The Company
follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67,

Accounting
for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects

, for
all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining
whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as
incurred.  The Company capitalizes
interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for
those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on
development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days
following issuance of the certificate of occupancy.  These costs are reflected on the balance
sheet as construction in progress for each specific property.  The Company expenses as incurred all payroll
costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted
above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance
and on specific major renovation at selected properties when additional
incremental employees are hired.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments

The valuation
of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133 and its
amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149) requires the Company to make estimates and
judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments.  The Company, where possible, bases the fair
values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on
listed market prices and third party quotes. 
Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on
current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant
to the financial instruments.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income
attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized
monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a
straight-line basis.  Leases entered into
between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are
generally year-to-year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or
monthly basis.  Fee and asset management
revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company
accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123
(R),


Share-Based Payment

, effective January 1,
2006, which results in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair
value of the share compensation granted.

The Black-Scholes
option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable.  This model is only one
method of valuing options and the Company’s use of this model should not be
interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy. 
Because the Company’s share options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its share options and the actual value of the
options may be significantly different.

Funds From Operations

For the year ended December 31,
2007, Funds From Operations (“FFO”) available to Common Shares and OP Units
increased $7.3 million, or 1.0%, as compared to the year ended December 31,
2006.  For the year ended December 31,
2006, FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units decreased $68.5 million, or
8.7%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005.

The following is a
reconciliation of net income to FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units for
each of the five years ended December 31, 2007:

Funds From Operations

(Amounts in thousands)

(1)

The National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from operations (“FFO”) (April 2002 White
Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)), excluding gains (or losses)
from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and
after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships
and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the
same basis.  The April 2002 White
Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for
previously depreciated operating properties only.  Once the Company commences the conversion of
units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such
property. FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units is


calculated on a basis consistent
with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net
income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that
contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP
Units are collectively referred to as the “Minority Interests - Operating
Partnership”. Subject to certain restrictions, the Minority Interests -
Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a
one-for-one basis.

(2)

The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to
Common Shares and OP Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of
the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized
measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or
losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real
estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar
condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO
and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units can help compare the operating
performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to
different companies.  FFO and FFO
available to Common Shares and OP Units do not represent net income, net income
available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in
accordance with GAAP.  Therefore, FFO and
FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units should not be exclusively
considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares
or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as
measures of liquidity.  The Company’s
calculation of FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units may differ
from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization
policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to
such other real estate companies.

Item
7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risks relating to the Company’s financial instruments result
primarily from changes in short-term LIBOR interest rates and changes in the
SIFMA index for tax exempt debt.  The
Company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market
risk.

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and term credit facilities as well
as floating rate tax exempt debt.  The
Company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions
and capital expenditures, while it typically incurs floating rate debt
obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in
advance of securing long-term fixed rate financing.  The Company continuously evaluates its level
of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including
its assessment of the current and future economic environment.

The Company also
utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk.  Interest rate protection agreements are used
to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa.  Derivatives are used for hedging purposes
rather than speculation.  The Company
does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes.  See also Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments.

The fair values of the
Company’s financial instruments (including such items in the financial
statement captions as cash and cash equivalents, other assets, lines of credit,
accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities) approximate their
carrying or contract values based on their nature, terms and interest rates
that approximate current market rates. 
The fair value of the Company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured
notes were approximately $3.7 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, at December 31,
2007.

At December 31,
2007, the Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately
$1.9 billion, or 20.2% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative
instruments.  If market rates of interest
on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 53 basis points (a
10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the
increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future
earnings and cash flows by approximately $10.2

million.  If market rates of interest on all of the
floating rate debt permanently decreased by 53 basis points (a 10% decrease
from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in
interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and
cash flows by approximately $10.2

million.

At December 31,
2007, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $7.6
billion, or 79.8% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative
instruments.  If market rates of interest


permanently increased by 58 basis points (a 10%
increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the
estimated fair value of the Company

’s

fixed rate debt would be approximately $6.9 billion.  If market rates of interest permanently
decreased by 58 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing
weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s
fixed rate debt would be approximately $8.4 billion.

At December 31,
2007, the Company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of
approximately $10.6 million.  If market
rates of interest permanently increased by 47 basis points (a 10% increase from
the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair
value of the Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately $6.5
million.  If market rates of interest
permanently decreased by 47 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s
existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the
Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately $15.0 million.

At December 31,
2006, the Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately
$1.5 billion, or 18.4% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative
instruments.  If market rates of interest
on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 49 basis points (a 10%
increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the
increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future
earnings and cash flows by approximately $7.3 million.  If market rates of interest on all of the floating
rate debt permanently decreased by 49 basis points (a 10% decrease from the
Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in interest
expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows
by approximately $7.3 million.

At December 31,
2006, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $6.6
billion, or 81.6% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative
instruments.  If market rates of interest
permanently increased by 60 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s
existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the
Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $6.0 billion.  If market rates of interest permanently
decreased by 60 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted
average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed rate
debt would be approximately $7.3 billion.

At December 31,
2006, the Company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of
approximately $16.2 million.  If market
rates of interest permanently increased by 54 basis points (a 10% increase from
the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair
value of the Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately $16.4
million.  If market rates of interest
permanently decreased by 54 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s
existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the
Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately $16.2 million.

These amounts were
determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the
Company’s financial instruments.  The
foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the Company’s debt and
derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities.  These analyses do not consider the effects of
the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an
environment.  Further, in the event of
changes of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further
mitigate its exposure to the changes. 
However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be
taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the
Company’s financial structure or results.

The Company cannot
predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and
derivative instruments and, therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can
there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous
pricing.  Consequently, future results
may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.

Item
9A.   Controls and Procedures

(a)         Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures:

Effective as of December 31, 2007, the Company carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15.  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in its Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

(b)         Management

’

s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

Equity Residential’s management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.  Under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to
be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.

Based
on the Company’s evaluation under the framework in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework, management concluded that its internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.  Our internal control over financial reporting
has been audited as of December 31, 2007 by Ernst & Young LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
is included herein.

(c)         Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting:

There were no changes to the internal control over financial reporting
of the Company identified in connection with the Company’s evaluation referred
to above that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Equity
Residential (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2007.  Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index to the financial
statements and schedule.  These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. 
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Equity Residential at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.  Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Equity Residential’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based
on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 22, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential

We have audited Equity Residential’s (the “Company”) internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Criteria”).  Equity Residential

’

s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company

’

s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.  Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances.  We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company

’

s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company

’

s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company

’

s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Equity Residential maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2007, based on the COSO Criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance
sheets of Equity Residential as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders

’

equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2007 of Equity Residential and our report dated February 22, 2008,
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1.

Business

Equity Residential (“EQR”), a Maryland real
estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500
company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality
apartment properties in top United States growth markets.  EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT.

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31,
2007 owned an approximate 93.6% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited
Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).  The Company is structured as an umbrella
partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), under which all property ownership and business
operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its
subsidiaries.  References to the “Company”
include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled
by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company, directly
or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a
portion of 579

properties in 24 states and the
District of Columbia consisting of 152,821 units.  The ownership breakdown includes (table does
not include various uncompleted development properties):

The

“

Wholly Owned Properties

”

are accounted for under the
consolidation method of accounting.  The
Company beneficially owns 100% fee simple title to 505 of the 507 Wholly Owned
Properties.  The Company owns the
building and improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements under
long-term ground leases that expire in 2026 for one property and 2077 for
another property.  These properties are
consolidated and reflected as real estate assets while the ground leases are
accounted for as operating leases in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (

“

SFAS

”

) No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

.

The
“Partially Owned Properties - Consolidated” are controlled by the Company but
have partners with minority interests and are accounted for under the
consolidation method of accounting.  The “Partially
Owned Properties - Unconsolidated” are partially owned but not controlled by
the Company and consist of investments in partnership interests and/or
subordinated mortgages that are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting.  The “Military Housing (Fee
Managed)” property consists of an investment in a limited liability company
that, as a result of the terms of the operating agreement, is accounted for as
a management contract right with all fees recognized as fee and asset
management revenue.

2.

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Basis of Presentation

Due to the Company’s ability as general partner
to control either through ownership or by contract the Operating Partnership
and its subsidiaries, other than entities that own controlling interests in the

F-12

Partially Owned Properties -
Unconsolidated and certain other entities in which the Company has investments,
the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary has

been consolidated with the Company for
financial reporting purposes.  Effective March 31,
2004, the consolidated financial statements also include all variable interest
entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.

The Company

’

s mergers and acquisitions were accounted for as
purchases in accordance with either Accounting Principles Board (

“

APB

”

)
Opinion No. 16,

Business Combinations

,
or SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

.

SFAS No. 141
requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.

The fair value of the consideration
given by the Company in the mergers were used as the valuation basis for each
of the combinations.  The accompanying
consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include the results of the
properties purchased through the mergers and through acquisitions from their
respective closing dates.

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate

The Company allocates the purchase price of
properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on
their fair values in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141.  In making estimates of fair values for
purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of
sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection
with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis
of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio, and other
market data.  The Company also considers
information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due
diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the
tangible and intangible assets acquired. 
The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired real estate to
various components as follows:

·

Land – Based on actual
purchase price if acquired separately or market research/comparables if
acquired with an operating property.

·

Furniture, Fixtures and
Equipment – Ranges between $8,000 and $13,000 per apartment unit acquired as an
estimate of the fair value of the appliances & fixtures inside a
unit.  The per-unit amount applied
depends on the type of apartment building acquired.  Depreciation is calculated on the
straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five years.

·

In-Place Leases – The
Company considers the value of acquired in-place leases that meet the
definition outlined in SFAS No. 141, paragraph 37.  The amortization period is the average
remaining term of each respective in-place acquired lease.

·

Other Intangible Assets – The
Company considers whether it has acquired other intangible assets that meet the
definition outlined in SFAS No. 141, paragraph 39, including any customer
relationship intangibles.  The
amortization period is the estimated useful life of the acquired intangible
asset.

·

Building – Based on the fair
value determined on an “as-if vacant” basis. 
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over an estimated
useful life of thirty years.

Replacements inside a unit such as appliances
and carpeting are depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life.  Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and
repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and
improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are
capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally five to ten years.  Initial direct leasing costs are expensed as
incurred as such expense approximates the deferral and amortization of initial
direct leasing costs over the lease terms. 
Property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers to
unrelated third parties, contingencies have been removed and sufficient cash
consideration has been received by the Company. 
Upon disposition, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the respective accounts. 
Any gain or loss on sale is recognized in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

The Company classifies real estate assets as real
estate held for disposition when it is certain a property will be disposed of
in accordance with SFAS No. 144 (see further discussion below).

F-13

The Company classifies properties under
development and/or expansion and properties in the lease up phase (including
land) as construction in progress until construction has been completed and all
certificates of occupancy permits have been obtained.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets

.  SFAS
No. 142 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires that goodwill
be reviewed for impairment at least annually. 
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.  SFAS Nos. 142 and 144 were effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.  The Company adopted these standards effective
January 1, 2002.  See Notes 13 and
19 for further discussion.

The Company periodically evaluates its
long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for
indicators of permanent impairment.  The
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors
such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of
each asset and legal and environmental concerns.  Future events could occur which would cause
the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss
is warranted.

F

or long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company
compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long-lived asset
against the carrying amount of that asset. 
If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the
carrying amount of the asset, the Company further analyzes each individual
asset for other temporary or permanent indicators of impairment.  An impairment loss would be recorded for the
difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset
if the Company deems this difference to be permanent.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, an impairment loss is
recognized when the estimated fair value of the asset, less the estimated cost
to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the asset measured at the time
that the Company has determined it will sell the asset.  Long-lived assets held for disposition and
the related liabilities are separately reported at the lower of their carrying
amounts or their estimated fair values, less their costs to sell, and are not
depreciated after reclassification to real estate held for disposition.

Cost Capitalization

See the

Real
Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate

section
for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of
fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. 
In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of
employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the
supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects.  These costs are reflected on the balance
sheet as an increase to depreciable property.

The Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67,

Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental
Operations of Real Estate Projects

, for all development projects and
uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the
criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred.  The Company capitalizes interest, real estate
taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly
responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities, with
capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the
certificate of occupancy.  These costs
are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each
specific property.  The Company expenses
as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our
properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to
certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovation at selected
properties when additional incremental employees are hired.

F-14

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all demand deposits, money
market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements
purchased with a maturity of three months or less, at the date of purchase, to
be cash equivalents.  The Company
maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions.  The combined account balances at one or more
institutions typically exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)
insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk
related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.  The Company believes that the risk is not
significant, as the Company does not anticipate the financial institutions’
non-performance.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and costs
incurred to obtain the Company’s lines of credit and long-term financings.  These costs are amortized over the terms of
the related debt.  Unamortized financing
costs are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date.  The accumulated amortization of such deferred
financing costs was $28.0 million and $24.5 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments

The valuation of financial instruments under
SFAS No. 107,

Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

, and SFAS No. 133 and its
amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149),

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, requires the
Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
instruments.  The Company, where
possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its
derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where
these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments
with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial
instruments.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest
rate changes.  The Company limits these
risks by following established risk management policies and procedures
including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt
instruments.

The
Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial
institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  When viewed in conjunction with the
underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge,
the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does
it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial
position in the future from the use of derivatives.

On
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 and its amendments
(SFAS Nos. 137/138/149), which requires an entity to recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to
measure those instruments at fair value. 
Additionally, the fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders

’

equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instruments
qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the
hedging activity.  When the terms of an
underlying transaction are modified, or when the underlying transaction is
terminated or completed, all changes in the fair value of the instrument are
marked-to-market with changes in value included in net income each period until
the instrument matures.  Any derivative
instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria of
SFAS No. 133 is marked-to-market each period.  The Company does not use derivatives for
trading or speculative purposes.

The fair value of the
Company

’

s
mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately $3.7 billion and
$5.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007.

The fair values of the Company

’

s financial instruments, other than mortgage notes payable, unsecured
notes and derivative instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, lines of
credit and other financial instruments, approximate their carrying or contract
values.  See Note 11 for further
discussion of derivative instruments.

F-15

Revenue Recognition

Rental income attributable to leases is recorded
when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not
materially different than on a straight-line basis.  Leases entered into between a resident and a
property, for the rental of an apartment unit, are generally year-to-year,
renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis.  Fee and asset management revenue and interest
income are recorded on an accrual basis.

Share-Based
Compensation

The
Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment,

as
required effective January 1, 2006. 
SFAS No. 123(R) requires all companies to expense share-based
compensation (such as share options), as well as making other revisions to SFAS
No. 123.  As the Company began
expensing all share-based compensation effective January 1, 2003, the
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a material effect on its
consolidated statements of operations or financial position.

The
cost related to share-based employee compensation included in the determination
of net income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is
equal to that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method
had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS No. 123.

The
fair value of the option grants as computed under SFAS No. 123 would be
recognized over the vesting period of the options.  The fair value for the Company

’

s share options was estimated at the time the share options were
granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions:

(1)

Expected volatility — Estimated based on
the historical volatility of EQR’s share price, on a monthly basis, for a
period matching the expected life of each grant.

(2)

Expected life — Approximates the actual
weighted average life of all share options granted since the Company went
public in 1993.

(3)

Expected dividend yield — Calculated by
averaging the historical annual yield on EQR shares for a period matching the
expected life of each grant, with the annual yield calculated by dividing
actual dividends by the average price of EQR’s shares in a given year.

(4)

Risk-free interest rate — The most
current U.S. Treasury rate available prior to the grant date for a period
matching the expected life of each grant.

The
valuation method and assumptions are the same as those the Company used in
accounting for option expense in its consolidated financial statements.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.  This model is only one method of valuing
options and the Company

’

s use of this model should not
be interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy.  Because the Company

’

s share options have characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in management

’

s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its share options and the actual value of
the options may be significantly different.

Income Taxes

Due
to the structure of the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations of
its operating properties, no provision for federal income taxes has been made
at the EQR level.  Historically, the
Company has generally only incurred certain state and local income, excise and
franchise taxes.  The Company has elected
Taxable REIT Subsidiary (“TRS”) status for certain of its corporate
subsidiaries, primarily those entities engaged in condominium conversion and
corporate housing activities and as a result, these entities will incur both
federal and state income taxes on any taxable income of such entities.

F-16

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences
attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  These assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates for which the temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.  The effect of
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings in the period
enacted.  The Company

’

s deferred tax assets are generally the result of tax affected
amortization of goodwill, differing depreciable lives on capitalized assets and
the timing of expense recognition for certain accrued liabilities.  As of December 31, 2007, the Company has
recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $12.5 million, which was fully
offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty in forecasting future
TRS taxable income.

The
Company provided for income, franchise and excise taxes allocated as follows in
the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands):

(1)

Primarily
includes state and local income, excise and franchise taxes.  In 2006, also includes $2.9 million of
federal income taxes related to a forfeited deposit on a terminated sale
transaction and included in income from continuing operations.  In 2005, also includes $2.0 million of
federal income taxes related to the sale of land parcels owned by a TRS and
included in income from continuing operations.

(2)

Primarily
represents federal income taxes (recovered) incurred on the gains on sales of
condominium units owned by a TRS and included in discontinued operations.  Also represents state and local income,
excise and franchise taxes on operating properties sold and included in
discontinued operations.

(3)

All
provision for income tax amounts are current and none are deferred.

The
Company utilized approximately $13.9 million and $43.9 million of net operating
losses (

“

NOL

”

) during the years
ended December 31, 2007 and 2005, respectively, and none were utilized in
2006.  The Company had no NOL
carryforwards available as of January 1, 2008 or 2006.

During
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company

’

s tax treatment of dividends and distributions were as follows:

The aggregate cost of land and depreciable property for
federal income tax purposes as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was
approximately $9.7 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively.

Minority Interests

Operating Partnership:  Net
income is allocated to minority interests based on their respective ownership
percentage of the Operating Partnership. 
The ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the number of units
of limited partnership interest (“OP Units”) held by the minority interests by
the total OP Units held by the minority interests and EQR.  Issuance of additional common shares of
beneficial interest,

F-17

$0.01 par value per share (the “Common Shares”), and OP Units changes
the ownership interests of both the minority interests and EQR.  Such transactions and the related proceeds
are treated as capital transactions.

Partially Owned Properties:  The
Company reflects minority interests in partially owned properties on the
balance sheet for the portion of properties consolidated by the Company that
are not wholly owned by the Company.  The
earnings or losses from those properties attributable to the minority interests
are reflected as minority interests in partially owned properties in the
consolidated statements of operations.

U

se of Estimates

In preparation of the Company’s
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as
well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain
reclassifications considered necessary for a fair presentation have been made
to the prior period financial statements in order to conform to the current
year presentation.  These
reclassifications have not changed the results of operations or shareholders

’

equity.

Other

The
Company adopted FASB Interpretation (

“

FIN

”

) No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

as required,
effective March 31, 2004.  The
adoption required the consolidation of all previously unconsolidated
development projects.  FIN No. 46
requires the Company to consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of
operations of the activities of a variable interest entity, which for the
Company includes only its development partnerships, if the Company is entitled
to receive a majority of the entity

’

s residual returns and/or is
subject to a majority of the risk of loss from such entity

’

s
activities.  The adoption of FIN No. 46
did not have any effect on net income as the aggregate results of operations of
these development properties were previously included in income (loss) from
investments in unconsolidated entities.

The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 150
and FSP No. FAS 150-3,

Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,

effective December 31, 2003.  SFAS No. 150
and FSP No. FAS 150-3 require the Company to make certain disclosures
regarding noncontrolling interests that are classified as equity in the
financial statements of a subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in
the parent

’

s financial statements under SFAS No. 150 (e.g.,
minority interests in consolidated limited-life subsidiaries).  The Company is presently the controlling
partner in various consolidated partnerships consisting of 27 properties and
5,455 units and various uncompleted development properties having a minority
interest book value of $26.2 million at December 31, 2007.  Some of these partnerships contain provisions
that require the partnerships to be liquidated through the sale of its assets
upon reaching a date specified in each respective partnership agreement.  The Company, as controlling partner, has an
obligation to cause the property owning partnerships to distribute proceeds of
liquidation to the Minority Interests in these Partially Owned Properties only
to the extent that the net proceeds received by the partnerships from the sale
of its assets warrant a distribution based on the partnership agreements.  As of December 31, 2007, the Company
estimates the value of Minority Interest distributions would have been
approximately $106.9 million (

“

Settlement
Value

”

) had the partnerships been
liquidated.  This Settlement Value is
based on estimated third party consideration realized by the partnerships upon
disposition of the Partially Owned Properties and is net of all other assets
and liabilities, including yield maintenance on the mortgages encumbering the
properties, that would have been due on December 31, 2007 had those
mortgages been prepaid.  Due to, among
other things, the inherent uncertainty in the sale of real estate assets, the
amount of any potential distribution to the Minority Interests in the Company

’

s Partially

F-18

Owned Properties is subject to change. 
To the extent that the partnerships

’

underlying assets are worth less than
the underlying liabilities, the Company has no obligation to remit any
consideration to the Minority Interests in Partially Owned Properties.

The Company adopted EITF Issue No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a
Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited
Partners Have Certain Rights

(Issue

“

04-5

”

), effective January 1,
2006.  Issue 04-5 provides guidance in
determining whether a general partner controls a limited partnership.  The Company consolidated its Lexford
syndicated portfolio consisting of 20 separate partnerships (10 properties)
containing 1,272 units, all of which were sold October 5, 2006.  The adoption did not have a material effect
on the results of operations or financial position.  See Note 4 for further discussion of the
adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-5.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,

an
interpretation of SFAS No. 143,

Asset Retirement
Obligations

.  A conditional
asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to retire assets where
the timing and/or method of settlement are conditioned on future events.  FIN No. 47 requires an entity to
recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement
obligation when incurred if the liability

’

s fair value can be reasonably estimated.  The Company adopted the provisions of FIN No. 47
for the year ended December 31, 2005. 
The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company

’

s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus in
FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

.  FIN No. 48 creates a single model to
address uncertainty in income tax positions and prescribes a minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being
recognized in the financial statements. 
It also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
transition and clearly scopes income taxes out of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

.  The Company adopted FIN No. 48 as
required effective January 1, 2007. 
The adoption of FIN No. 48 did not have a material effect on the
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

.  SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and expands disclosure about
fair value measurements. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 157 as required
effective January 1, 2008.  While
still under review, adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets

and Financial Liabilities

.  SFAS No. 159 provides a

“

Fair Value Option

”

under which a company may irrevocably elect fair value as the
initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial
instruments.  The Fair Value Option will
be available on a contract-by-contract basis with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings as those changes occur. 
SFAS No. 159 is effective beginning January 1, 2008, but the
Company has decided not to adopt this optional standard.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations.

SFAS No. 141(R) will significantly
change the accounting for business combinations.  Under SFAS No. 141(R), an acquiring
entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited
exceptions.  SFAS No. 141(R) will
change the accounting treatment for certain specific acquisition related items
including: (1) expensing acquisition related costs as incurred; (2) valuing
noncontrolling interests at fair value at the acquisition date; and (3) expensing
restructuring costs associated with an acquired business.  SFAS No. 141(R) also includes a
substantial number of new disclosure requirements.  SFAS No. 141(R) is to be applied
prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
after January 1, 2009.  We expect
SFAS No. 141(R) will have an impact on our accounting for future
business combinations once adopted, but we

F-19

are still currently assessing the impact it will have on the
consolidated results of operations and financial position.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements.

SFAS No. 160
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.  It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest
in a subsidiary (minority interest) is an ownership interest in the
consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and separate from the parent company’s equity.  Among other requirements, this statement
requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the
amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. It
also requires disclosure, on the face of the Consolidated Statements of
Operations, of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the
parent and to the noncontrolling interest. 
This statement is effective for the Company on January 1,
2009.  The Company is currently
evaluating the impact SFAS No. 160 will have on its consolidated results
of operations and financial position.

Shareholders’
Equity and Minority Interests

The following tables present the
changes in the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Shares and OP Units for
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

In February 1998,
the Company filed and the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 Registration
Statement to register $1.0 billion of equity securities.  In addition, the Company carried over $272.4
million related to a prior registration statement.  As of February 6, 2008, $956.5 million
in equity securities remained available for issuance under this registration
statement.

F-20

On April 27, May 24 and
December 3, 2007, the Board of Trustees approved an increase of $200.1
million, an additional $500.0 million and an additional $500.0 million,
respectively, to the

Company’s

authorized share repurchase program. 
Considering the above additional authorizations and the repurchase
activity for the year ended December 31, 2007, EQR has authorization to
repurchase an additional $475.6 million of its shares as of December 31,
2007.

During the year ended December 31,
2007, the Company repurchased 27,484,346 of its Common Shares at an average
price of $44.62 per share for total consideration of $1.2 billion.  These shares were retired subsequent to the
repurchases.  Of the total shares
repurchased, 84,046 shares were repurchased from employees at an average price
of $53.85 per share (the average of the then current market prices) to cover
the minimum statutory tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of
employees

’

restricted shares.  The remaining 27,400,300 shares were
repurchased in the open market at an average price of $44.59 per share.  As of December 31, 2007, transactions to
repurchase 125,000 of the 27,484,346 Common Shares had not yet settled.  As of December 31, 2007, the Company has
reduced the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding by this amount and
recorded a liability of $4.6 million included in other liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheets.

During the year ended December 31,
2006, the Company repurchased 1,897,912 of its Common Shares in the open market
at an average price of $43.85 per share. 
The Company paid approximately $83.2 million for these shares, which
were retired subsequent to the repurchases.

The equity positions of various individuals and entities
that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for
OP Units are collectively referred to as the “Minority Interests — Operating
Partnership”.  Subject to certain
restrictions, the Minority Interests — Operating Partnership may exchange their
OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

Net proceeds from the Company’s
Common Share and Preferred Share (see definition below) offerings are
contributed by the Company to the Operating Partnership.  In return for those contributions, EQR
receives a number of OP Units in the Operating Partnership equal to the number
of Common Shares it has issued in the equity offering (or in the case of a
preferred equity offering, a number of preference units in the Operating
Partnership equal in number and having the same terms as the Preferred Shares
issued in the equity offering).  As a
result, the net offering proceeds from Common Shares and Preferred Shares are
allocated between shareholders’ equity and Minority Interests — Operating
Partnership to account for the change in their respective percentage ownership
of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

The
Company

’

s declaration of trust authorizes the Company to
issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par
value per share (the “Preferred Shares”), with specific rights, preferences and
other attributes as the Board of Trustees may determine, which may include
preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the rights of holders of the
Company’s Common Shares.

The following table presents the Company’s issued and
outstanding Preferred Shares as of December 31, 2007 and 2006:

F-21

(1)

On or after the
redemption date, redeemable preferred shares (Series K and N) may be
redeemed for cash at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at a
redemption price equal to the liquidation price per share, plus accrued and
unpaid distributions, if any.

(2)

On or after the
redemption date, convertible preferred shares (Series E & H) may
be redeemed under certain circumstances at the option of the Company for cash
(in the case of Series E) or Common Shares (in the case of Series H),
in whole or in part, at various redemption prices per share based upon the
contractual conversion rate, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any.

(3)

Dividends on all
series of Preferred Shares are payable quarterly at various pay dates.  The dividend listed for Series N is a
Preferred Share rate and the equivalent Depositary Share annual dividend is
$1.62 per share.

(4)

The Series N
Preferred Shares have a corresponding depositary share that consists of ten
times the number of shares and one-tenth the liquidation value and dividend per
share.

(5)

On May 25,
2007, the Company issued an irrevocable notice to redeem for cash on July 16,
2007 all 700,000 shares of its 8.60% Series D Preferred Shares.  The Company recorded the write-off of
approximately $6.1 million in original issuance costs as a premium on
redemption of Preferred Shares in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

During the year ended December 31,
2006, the Company redeemed for cash all 460,000 shares of its 9.125% Series C
Preferred Shares with a liquidation value of $115.0 million.  The Company recorded the write-off of
approximately $4.0 million in original issuance costs as a premium on
redemption of Preferred Shares in the accompanying consolidated statements of

11.          Derivative
Instruments

The following table
summarizes the consolidated derivative instruments at December 31, 2007 (dollar
amounts are in thousands):

Value Hedges — Converts outstanding fixed rate debt to a floating interest
rate.

(2) Forward
Starting Swaps — Designed to partially fix the interest rate in advance of a

rate.

On December 31,
2007, the net derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as other
liabilities of approximately $10.6 million and other assets of $29,000.  As of December 31, 2007, there were
approximately $16.5 million in deferred losses, net, included in accumulated
other comprehensive loss.  Based on the
estimated fair values of the net derivative instruments at December 31,
2007, the Company may recognize an estimated $3.6 million of accumulated other
comprehensive loss as additional interest expense during the year ending December 31,
2008.

In June 2007, the
Company received approximately $2.4 million to terminate five forward starting
swaps in conjunction with the issuance of $650.0 million of ten-year unsecured
notes.  The majority of the $2.4 million
has been deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and
will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the life of the
unsecured notes.

In January 2006, the
Company received approximately $10.7 million to terminate six forward starting
swaps in conjunction with the issuance of $400.0 million of ten and one-half

will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the life of the
unsecured notes.

years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were
outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share because the effects would be anti-dilutive.  In addition, the effect of the Common Shares
that could ultimately be issued upon the conversion/exchange of the Operating
Partnership

’s

$650.0 million
exchangeable senior notes were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive.

date of adoption of SFAS No. 144), all operations related to condominium
conversion properties effective upon their respective transfer into a TRS and
all properties held for sale, if any.

The components of discontinued operations are

Share
Incentive Plans

On May 15, 2002, the shareholders of EQR
approved the Company

’s 2002 Share
Incentive Plan.  The maximum aggregate
number of awards that may be granted under this plan may not exceed 7.5% of the
Company’s outstanding Common Shares calculated on a “fully diluted” basis and
determined annually on the first day of each calendar year.  As of January 1, 2008, this amount
equaled 21,631,555, of which 10,392,101 shares were available for future
issuance.  No awards may be granted under
the 2002 Share Incentive Plan after February 20, 2012.

Pursuant
to the 2002 Share Incentive Plan and the Fifth Amended and Restated 1993 Share
Option and Share Award Plan (collectively the “Share Incentive Plans”),
officers, trustees and key employees of the Company may be granted share
options to acquire Common Shares (“Options”) including non-qualified share
options (“NQSOs”), incentive share options (“ISOs”) and share appreciation
rights (“SARs”), or may be granted restricted or non-restricted shares, subject
to conditions and restrictions as described in the Share Incentive Plans.  Finally, certain executive officers of the
Company participate in the Company’s performance based restricted share
plan.  Options, SARs, restricted shares
and performance shares are sometimes collectively referred to herein as “Awards”.

The
Options are generally granted at the fair market value of the Company’s Common
Shares at the date of grant, vest in three equal installments over a three year
period, are exercisable upon vesting and expire ten years from the date of
grant.  The exercise price for all
Options under the Share Incentive Plans is equal to the fair market value of
the underlying Common Shares at the time the Option is granted.  The Fifth Amended and Restated 1993 Share
Option and Share Award Plan will terminate at such time as all outstanding
Awards have expired or have been exercised/vested.  The Board of Trustees may at any time amend
or terminate the Share Incentive Plans, but termination will not affect Awards
previously granted.  Any Options which
had vested prior to such a termination would remain exercisable by the holder.

As to the
restricted shares that have been awarded through December 31, 2007, these
shares generally vest three years from the award date.  During the three-year period of restriction,
the Company

’s

unvested restricted shareholders receive
quarterly dividend payments on their shares at the same rate and on the same
date as any other Common Share holder. 
In addition, the Company

’

s unvested restricted shareholders have the
same voting rights as any other Common Share holder.  As a result, dividends paid on unvested
restricted shares are included as a component of retained earnings (deficit)
and have not been considered in reducing net income available to Common Shares
in a manner similar to the Company

’

s preferred share dividends for the earnings
per share calculation.  If employment is
terminated prior to the lapsing of the restriction, the shares are generally
canceled.

In
addition, each year prior to 2007, selected executive officers of the Company
received performance-based awards. 
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company has elected to discontinue
the award of new performance-based award grants.  The executive officers have the opportunity
to earn in Common Shares an amount as little as 0% to as much as 225% of the
target number of performance-based awards. The owners of performance-based
awards have no right to vote, receive dividends or transfer the awards until
Common Shares are issued in exchange for the awards.  The number of Common Shares the executive
officer actually receives on the third anniversary of the grant date will
depend on the excess, if any, by which the Company

’

s Average Annual Return (i.e., the average of the Common Share
dividends declared during each year as a percentage of the Common Share price
as of the first business day of the first performance year and the average
percentage increase in funds from operations (

“

FFO

”

) for each calendar year on a per share basis over the prior year) for
the three performance years exceeds the average of the 10-year Treasury Note
interest rate as of the first business day in January of each performance
year (the

“

T-Note Rate

”

).

F-34

If the
Company

’

s Average Annual
Return exceeds the T-Note Rate by an amount which falls between any of the
percentages in excess of the 2% threshold, the performance-based award will be
determined by extrapolation between the two percentages.  Fifty percent of the Common Shares to which
an executive officer may be entitled under the performance share grants will
vest, subject to the executive

’

s continued employment with the Company, on the third anniversary of
the award (which will be the date the Common Shares are issued); twenty-five
percent will vest on the fourth anniversary and the remaining twenty-five
percent will vest on the fifth anniversary. 
The Common Shares will also fully vest upon the executive

’

s death, retirement at or after age 62,
disability or upon a change in control of the Company.

The
following tables summarize compensation information regarding the performance
shares, restricted shares, share options and Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
for the three years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in
thousands):

Compensation expense is generally
recognized for Awards as follows:

·

Restricted shares and share options — Straight-line
method over the vesting period of the options or shares regardless of cliff or
ratable vesting distinctions.

·

Performance shares — Accelerated method with each
vesting tranche valued as a separate award, with a separate vesting date,
consistent with the estimated value of the award at each period end.

·

ESPP discount — Immediately upon the purchase of
common shares each quarter.

The
total compensation expense related to Awards not yet vested at December 31,
2007 is $24.6 million, which is

F-35

expected to be recognized
over a weighted average term of 1.4 years.

See
Note 2 for additional information regarding the Company’s share-based
compensation.

The table below summarizes the Award activity of the Share Incentive
Plans and options assumed in connection with mergers (the “Merger Options”) for
the three years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

(1)  The aggregate intrinsic value of options
exercised during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $13.7
million and $58.0 million, respectively. 
These values were calculated as the difference between the strike price
of the underlying awards and the per share price at which each respective award
was exercised.

(2)  The weighted average grant date fair value for
Options granted during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $6.26
per share, $4.22 per share and $2.64 per share, respectively.

The following table
summarizes information regarding options outstanding and exercisable at December 31,
2007:

F-36

(1)

The aggregate
intrinsic value of both options outstanding and options vested and expected to
vest as of December 31, 2007 is $62.2 million.

(2)

The aggregate
intrinsic value and weighted average remaining contractual life in years of
options exercisable as of December 31, 2007 is $59.9 million and 5.0
years, respectively.

Note:  The aggregate intrinsic
values in Notes (1) and (2) above were both calculated as the excess
between the Company’s closing share price of $36.47 per share on December 31,
2007 and the strike price of the underlying awards.

As
of December 31, 2006 and 2005, 6,567,868 Options (with a weighted average
exercise price of $26.87) and 6,940,065 Options (with a weighted average
exercise price of $25.65) were exercisable, respectively.

Employee Plans

The Company established an Employee Share Purchase Plan to provide each
employee and trustee the ability to annually acquire up to $100,000 of Common
Shares of the Company.  In 2003, the
Company

’

s

shareholders
approved an increase in the aggregate number of Common Shares available under
the ESPP to 7,000,000 (from 2,000,000). 
The Company has 4,081,688 Common Shares available for purchase under the
ESPP at December 31, 2007.  The
Common Shares may be purchased quarterly at a price equal to 85% of the lesser
of: (a) the closing price for a share on the last day of such quarter; and
(b) the greater of: (i) the closing price for a share on the first
day of such quarter, and (ii) the average closing price for a share for
all the business days in the quarter. 
The following table summarizes information regarding the Common Shares
issued under the ESPP:

The
Company established a defined contribution plan (the “401(k) Plan”) to
provide retirement benefits for employees that meet minimum employment
criteria.  The Company matches dollar for
dollar up to the first 3% of eligible compensation that a participant
contributes to the 401(k) Plan. 
Participants are vested in the Company

’

s

contributions over
five years.  The Company recognized an
expense in the amount of $4.2 million, $2.3 million and $3.0 million for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company may also
elect to make an annual discretionary profit-sharing contribution as a
percentage of each individual employee

’

s

eligible compensation under the 401(k) Plan.  The Company recognized an expense of
approximately $1.5 million, $3.3 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company established
a supplemental executive retirement plan (the

“SERP”) to provide certain
officers and trustees an opportunity to defer a portion of their eligible
compensation in order to save for retirement. 
The SERP is restricted to investments in Company Common Shares, certain
marketable securities that have been specifically approved and cash
equivalents.  The deferred compensation
liability represented in the SERP and the securities issued to fund such
deferred compensation liability are consolidated by the Company and carried on
the Company

’

s

balance sheet, and the Company

’

s

Common Shares held in the SERP are accounted for as a reduction to paid
in capital.

16.

Distribution
Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan

On November 3,
1997, the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3 Registration Statement to
register 14,000,000 Common Shares pursuant to a Distribution Reinvestment and
Share Purchase Plan (the “DRIP Plan”). 
The registration statement was declared effective on November 25,
1997.  The Company has 11,571,277 Common
Shares available for issuance under the DRIP Plan at December 31, 2007.

The
DRIP Plan provides holders of record and beneficial owners of Common Shares and
Preferred Shares with a simple and convenient method of investing cash
distributions in additional Common Shares (which is referred to herein as the “Dividend
Reinvestment — DRIP Plan”).  Common
Shares may also be purchased on a monthly basis with optional cash payments
made by participants in the DRIP Plan and interested new investors, not
currently shareholders of the Company, at the market price of the Common Shares
less a discount ranging between 0% and 5%, as determined in accordance with the
DRIP Plan (which

F-38

is referred to herein as the “Share
Purchase — DRIP Plan”).  Common Shares
purchased under the DRIP Plan may, at the option of the Company, be directly
issued by the Company or purchased by the Company

’

s

transfer agent in
the open market using participants’ funds.

17.

Transactions
with Related Parties

The Company provided asset and property
management services to certain related entities for properties not owned by the
Company.  Fees received for providing
such services were approximately $0.3 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million
for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company leases its corporate headquarters
from an entity controlled by EQR

’

s Chairman of the
Board of Trustees.  The lease terminates
on July 31, 2011.  Amounts incurred
for such office space for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively, were approximately $2.9 million, $2.8 million and $2.1
million.  The Company believes these
amounts equal market rates for such space.

The Company had the following additional
non-continuing related party transaction:

·

The Company reimbursed its former
Chief Operating Officer for the actual operating costs (excluding acquisition
costs) of operating his personal aircraft for himself and other employees on
Company business in 2005.  For the year
ended December 31, 2005, the amount incurred was approximately $0.4
million.

18.

Commitments
and Contingencies

The
Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various Federal, state and
local environmental laws.  Compliance by
the Company with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on the
Company.  However, the Company cannot
predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on its current
properties or on properties that it may acquire in the future.

The Company is party to a
housing discrimination lawsuit brought by a non-profit civil rights
organization in April 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Maryland.  The suit alleges that the
Company designed and built approximately 300 of its properties in violation of
the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act and Americans With
Disabilities Act.  The suit seeks actual
and punitive damages, injunctive relief (including modification of
non-compliant properties), costs and attorneys’ fees.  The Company believes it has a number of
viable defenses, including that a majority of the named properties were
completed before the operative dates of the statutes in question and/or were
not designed or built by the Company.  Accordingly,
the Company is defending the suit vigorously. 
Due to the pendency of the Company

’

s

defenses and the
uncertainty of many other critical factual and legal issues, it is not possible
to determine or predict the outcome of the suit and as a result, no amounts
have been accrued at December 31, 2007. 
While no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe that the
suit, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on the
Company.

The Company does not believe
there is any other litigation pending or threatened against it that,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably may be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Company.

During
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company established a
reserve and recorded a corresponding expense, net of insurance receivables, for
estimated uninsured property damage at certain of its properties caused by
various hurricanes in each respective year. 
During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company received $11.2
million in insurance proceeds and recorded an additional $7.9 million of
receivables in anticipation of proceeds expected.  As of December 31, 2007, a receivable of
$1.8 million and a liability of $1.3 million are included in other assets and
other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets.

F-39

As
of December 31, 2007, the Company has thirteen projects totaling 4,185
units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging
through June 30, 2010.  Some of the
projects are developed solely by the Company, while others are co-developed
with various third party development partners. 
The development venture agreements with partners are primarily
deal-specific, with differing terms regarding profit-sharing, equity
contributions, returns on investment, buy-sell agreements and other customary
provisions.  The partner is most often
the “general” or “managing” partner of the development venture.  The typical buy-sell arrangements contain
appraisal rights and provisions that provide the right, but not the obligation,
for the Company to acquire the partner’s interest in the project at fair market
value upon the expiration of a negotiated time period (typically two to five
years after substantial completion of the project).  However, the buy-sell provisions with one
partner covering three projects does require the Company to purchase the
partner’s interest in the projects at fair market value five years following
the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed
property.

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
and 2005, total operating lease payments incurred for office space, including a
portion of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and utilities, and including
rent due under two ground leases, aggregated $7.6 million, $6.9 million and
$6.3 million, respectively.

The Company has entered into a retirement benefits
agreement with its Chairman of the Board of Trustees and deferred compensation
agreements with its former chief operating officer and two former chief
executive officers.  During the years
ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized
compensation expense of $0.7 million, $1.1 million and $2.2 million,
respectively, related to these agreements.

The following table summarizes the Company

’

s contractual obligations for minimum rent payments under operating
leases and deferred compensation for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31,
2007:

(a)

Minimum basic rent due for various
office space the Company leases and fixed base rent due on ground leases for
two properties.

(b)

Estimated payments to the Company’s Chairman, two former CEO’s and its former chief operating
officer based on planned retirement dates.

19.

Impairment

The
Company incurred impairment losses of $1.1 million, $2.4 million and $0.6
million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, related to the write-off of various pursuit and out-of-pocket
costs for terminated acquisition, disposition and development
transactions.  The Company also took
impairment charges of $0.6 and $2.0 million associated with the write-off of
various deferred sales costs following the decision to halt the condominium
conversion and sale process at assets for the year ended December 31, 2007
and 2006, respectively.

During
the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded approximately $30.0
million of asset impairment charges related to its write-down of the entire
carrying value of the goodwill on its corporate housing business.  Following the guidance in SFAS No. 142,
this charge was the result of the continued poor operating performance of the
corporate housing business and management

’

s expectations for future performance.

Reportable
Segments

Operating segments are
defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated regularly by senior management.  Senior management decides how resources are
allocated and assesses performance on a monthly basis.

The Company

’

s primary business is owning, managing,
and operating multifamily residential properties, which includes the generation
of rental and other related income through the leasing of apartment units to
residents.  Senior management evaluates
the performance of each of our apartment communities individually and
geographically, and both on a same store and non-same store basis; however,
each of our apartment communities generally has similar economic
characteristics, residents, products and services.  The Company

’

s
operating segments have been aggregated by geography in a manner identical to
that which is provided to its chief operating decision maker.

The Company

’

s fee and asset management, development
(including FIN No. 46 partially owned properties), condominium conversion
and corporate housing (Equity Corporate Housing or

“

ECH

”

) activities are
immaterial and do not individually meet the threshold requirements of a
reportable segment as provided for in SFAS No. 131 and as such, have been
aggregated in the tables presented below.

All revenues are from
external customers and there is no customer who contributed 10% or more of the
Company

’

s total revenues during the
three years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, or 2005.

The primary financial
measure for the Company

’

s rental
real estate properties is net operating income (

“

NOI

”

), which
represents rental income less:  1)
property and maintenance expense; 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense;
and 3) property management expense (all as reflected in the accompanying
statements of operations).  The Company
believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the
operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure
of the actual operating results of the Company

’

s
apartment communities.  Current year NOI
is compared to prior year NOI and current year budgeted NOI as a measure of
financial performance.  The following
table presents NOI for each segment from our rental real estate specific to
continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively, as well as total assets for the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively (amounts in thousands):

Same store includes properties owned for all of both
2007 and 2006 which represented 115,857 units.

During the year ended December 31,
2007, the Company entered into resignation/release agreements with its former
Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and one other former executive vice
president.  The Company recorded
approximately $3.4 million of additional general and administrative expense

2007 and 2006, the Company recognized $0.3 million and $14.7 million,
respectively, of forfeited deposits for various terminated transactions,
included in interest and other income. 
In addition, during 2007 the Company received $4.1 million for the
settlement of insurance litigation claims from 2000 through 2002.  This amount was recorded as interest and
other income.

of Wellsford 8.25% Convertible Trust Preferred Securities during 2005;

·

$3.7 million and $57.1 million for its ownership
interest in Rent.com in connection with the acquisition of Rent.com by eBay, Inc.
in 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Both
amounts were recorded as interest and other income in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations; and

·

$0.3 million as a partial distribution for its
ownership interest in Constellation Real Technologies, LLC in 2006.  The amount was recorded as interest and other
income.

During
the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company established a
reserve and recorded a corresponding expense related to potential liabilities
associated with certain asset sales. 
During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company paid
approximately $0.7 million in settlements and recorded $1.9 million in
additional reserves.  The balance of the
reserves as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $7.4 million

if adversely determined or settled, will have a material adverse effect on the
Company.
