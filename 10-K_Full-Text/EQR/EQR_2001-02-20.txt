                       EQUITY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES TRUST

                                





                                 PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

         Equity Residential Properties Trust ("EQR") is a self-administered
and self-managed equity real estate investment trust ("REIT"). EQR was
organized in March 1993 and commenced operations on August 18, 1993 upon
completion of its initial public offering (the "EQR IPO") of 13,225,000
common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share ("Common
Shares"). EQR was formed to continue the multifamily property business
objectives and acquisition strategies of certain affiliated entities
controlled by Mr. Samuel Zell, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of EQR.
These entities had been engaged in the acquisition, ownership and operation
of multifamily residential properties since 1969. As used herein, the term
"Company" includes EQR and those entities owned or controlled by it, as the
survivor of the mergers between EQR and each of Wellsford Residential
Property Trust ("Wellsford") (the "Wellsford Merger"), Evans Withycombe
Residential, Inc. ("EWR") (the "EWR Merger"), Merry Land & Investment
Company, Inc. ("MRY") (the "MRY Merger") and Lexford Residential Trust
("LFT") ("the LFT Merger") (collectively, the "Mergers"). The term "Company"
also includes Globe Business Resources, Inc. ("Globe"), Temporary Quarters,
Inc. ("TQ") and Grove Property Trust ("Grove"). The Company has elected to be
taxed as a REIT under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code").

         The Company has formed a series of partnerships (the "Financing
Partnerships") which beneficially own certain Properties (see definition
below) that may be encumbered by mortgage indebtedness. In general, these are
structured so that ERP Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating
Partnership"), a subsidiary of EQR, owns a 1% limited partner interest and a
98% general partner interest in each, with the remaining 1% general partner
interest in each Financing Partnership owned by various qualified REIT
subsidiaries wholly owned by the Company (each a "QRS Corporation"). Rental
income from the Properties that are beneficially owned by a Financing
Partnership is used first to service the applicable mortgage debt and pay
other operating expenses and any excess is then distributed 1% to the
applicable QRS Corporation, as the general partner of such Financing
Partnership, and 99% to the Operating Partnership, as the sole 1% limited
partner and as the 98% general partner. The Company has also formed a series
of limited liability companies that own certain Properties (collectively, the
"LLCs"). The Operating Partnership is a 99% managing member of each LLC and a
QRS Corporation is a 1% member of each LLC.

         The Company's subsidiaries include the Operating Partnership, a
series of management limited partnerships and companies (collectively, the
"Management Partnerships" or the "Management Companies"), the Financing
Partnerships, the LLC's and certain other entities.

         As of December 31, 2000, the Company owned or had interests in 1,104
multifamily properties containing 227,704 apartment units (individually, a
"Property" and collectively, the "Properties") consisting of the following:



         The "Partially Owned Properties" are controlled and partially owned
by the Company but have partners with minority interests and are accounted
for under the consolidation method of accounting. The "Unconsolidated
Properties" are partially owned but not controlled by the Company and consist
of investments in partnership interests and/or subordinated mortgages that
are accounted for under the equity method of accounting




         The Company is one of the largest publicly traded REIT's (based on the
aggregate market value of its outstanding Common Shares) and is the largest
publicly traded REIT owner of multifamily properties (based on the number of
apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned). The Company's
Properties are located in 36 states with it's corporate headquarters located in
Chicago, Illinois as well as over thirty management offices throughout The
United States.

         The Company has approximately 7,400 employees. An on-site manager, who
supervises the on-site employees and is responsible for the day-to-day
operations of the Property, directs each of the Company's Properties. A leasing
administrator and/or property administrator generally assists the manager. In
addition, a maintenance director at each Property supervises a maintenance staff
whose responsibilities include a variety of tasks, including responding to
service requests, preparing vacant apartments for the next resident and
performing preventive maintenance procedures year-round.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND OPERATING STRATEGIES

         The Company seeks to maximize both current income and long-term growth
in income, thereby increasing:

     -    the value of the Properties;

     -    distributions on a per Common Share basis; and

     -    shareholders' value.

The Company's strategies for accomplishing these objectives are:

     -    maintaining and increasing Property occupancy while increasing rental
          rates;

     -    controlling expenses, providing regular preventive maintenance, making
          periodic renovations and enhancing amenities;

     -    maintaining a ratio of consolidated debt-to-total market
          capitalization of less than 50%;

     -    strategically acquiring and disposing of properties; and

     -    purchasing newly developed, as well as co-investing in the development
          of, multifamily communities.

     -    entering into joint ventures related to the ownership of established
          properties.

     -    strategically investing in various businesses that will enhance
          services for the properties.

         The Company is committed to tenant satisfaction by striving to
anticipate industry trends and implementing strategies and policies
consistent with providing quality tenant services. In addition, the Company
continuously surveys rental rates of competing properties and conducts
satisfaction surveys of residents to determine the factors they consider most
important in choosing a particular apartment unit.

ACQUISITION STRATEGIES

         The Company anticipates that future property acquisitions will be
located in the continental United States. Management will continue to use
market information to evaluate acquisition opportunities. The Company's
market database allows it to review the primary economic indicators of the
markets where the Company currently manages Properties and where it expects
to expand its operations. Acquisitions may be financed from various sources
of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional
equity securities, sales of Properties and collateralized and
uncollateralized borrowings. In addition, the Company may acquire additional
multifamily properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited
partnership interests in the Operating Partnership ("OP Units") as
consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain
circumstances, partially defer the sellers' tax consequences.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, the Company will consider:




     -    the geographic area and type of community;

     -    the location, construction quality, condition and design of the
          property;

     -    the current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to
          increase cash flow;

     -    the potential for capital appreciation of the property;

     -    the terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent
          increases;

     -    the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory
          environment of the community in which the property is located;

     -    the occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type
          in the vicinity (the overall market and submarket);

     -    the prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of
          the property;

     -    the benefits of integration into existing operations; and

     -    competition from existing multifamily properties and the potential for
          the construction of new multifamily properties in the area.

         The Company expects to purchase multifamily properties with physical
and market characteristics similar to the Properties.

DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES

         The Company seeks to make investments towards the development of
properties in markets where it discerns strong demand, which will enable it
to achieve superior rates of return. The Company's current communities under
development and future developments are in markets or will be in markets
where certain market demographics justify the development of high quality
multifamily communities. In evaluating whether to develop an apartment
community in a particular location, the Company analyzes relevant
demographic, economic and financial data. Specifically, the Company considers
the following factors, among others, in determining the viability of a
potential new apartment community:

     -    income levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market;

     -    uniqueness of location;

     -    household growth and net migration of the relevant market's
          population;

     -    supply/demand ratio, competitive housing alternatives, sub-market
          occupancy and rent levels;

     -    barriers to entry that would limit competition; and

     -    purchase prices and yields of available existing stabilized
          communities, if any.

DISPOSITION STRATEGIES

         Management will use market information to evaluate dispositions.
Factors the Company considers in deciding whether to dispose of its
Properties include the following:

     -    potential increases in new construction;

     -    areas where the economy is expected to decline substantially; and

     -    markets where the Company does not intend to establish long-term
          concentrations.

         The Company will reinvest the proceeds received from property
dispositions primarily to fund property acquisitions as well as fund
development activities. In addition, when feasible the Company may structure
these transactions as tax deferred exchanges.

FINANCING STRATEGIES

         The Company intends to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt-to-total
market capitalization of 50% or less. At December 31, 2000, the Company had a
ratio of approximately 37.8% based on the market




value of equity equal to the closing price of the Company's Common Shares on
the New York Stock Exchange and assuming conversion of all OP Units plus the
liquidation preference of the Company's preferred shares of beneficial
interest, $0.01 par value per share ("Preferred Shares") and the Operating
Partnership's preference units and interests. It is the Company's policy that
all indebtedness (other than short-term trade, employee compensation or
similar indebtedness that will be paid in the ordinary course of business) be
incurred by the Operating Partnership to the extent necessary to fund the
business activities conducted by the Operating Partnership and its
subsidiaries.

         The Operating Partnership filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement on
August 25, 2000 to register $1 billion of debt securities. The SEC declared
this registration statement effective on September 8, 2000. In addition, the
Operating Partnership carried over $430 million related to the registration
statement effective on February 27, 1998. As of December 31, 2000, $1.43
billion in debt securities remained available for issuance under this
registration statement.

         The Company filed with the SEC on February 3, 1998 a Form S-3
Registration Statement to register $1 billion of equity securities. The SEC
declared this registration statement effective on February 27, 1998. In
addition, the Company carried over $272 million related to the registration
statement which was declared effective on August 4, 1997. As of December 31,
2000, $1.1 billion in equity securities remained available for issuance under
this registration statement.

of credit matures in August 2002. As of February 15, 2001, $200 million was
outstanding under this facility at a weighted average interest rate of 6.34%.

In connection with its acquisition of Globe, the Company assumed a revolving
credit facility with Fifth Third Bank with potential borrowings of up to $55.0
million. This line of credit matures in May, 2003. As of February 15, 2001, no
amounts were outstanding under this facility.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

         On October 19, 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of the
multifamily property business of MRY through the MRY Merger. The transaction was
valued at approximately $2.2 billion and included 108 Properties containing
32,315 units, three Properties under construction and/or expansion anticipated
to contain 872 units and six Additional Properties containing 1,297 units that
were contributed to six joint ventures. The purchase price consisted of:

     -    21.8 million Common Shares issued by the Company with a market value
          of approximately $1 billion;

     -    liquidation value of $369.1 million for the following:

         a) MRY Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares of Beneficial
         Interest;
         b) MRY Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares of Beneficial
         Interest;
         c) MRY Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares of Beneficial
         Interest;
         d) MRY Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial
         Interest;
         e) MRY Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial
         Interest;

     -    assumption of MRY's minority interest with a market value of
          approximately $40.2 million.

     -    assumption of mortgage indebtedness, unsecured notes and the
          outstanding balance under a line of credit in the amount of $723.5
          million;

     -    assumption of other liabilities of approximately $46.5 million; and

     -    other merger related costs of approximately $51.9 million.

         In the MRY Merger, each outstanding common share of beneficial
interest of MRY was converted into .53 of a Common Share. In addition, MRY
spun-off certain assets and liabilities to Merry Land Properties, Inc. ("MRYP
Spinco"). In connection with this spin-off, each holder of MRY common shares
received one share of MRYP Spinco for each twenty shares of MRY common held.
As partial consideration for the transfer, the Company extended a $25
million, one year, non-revolving loan to MRYP Spinco pursuant to a Senior
Debt Agreement. As additional consideration, the Company extended an
additional $20 million of indebtedness to MRYP Spinco under a 15-year
Subordinated Debt Agreement, bearing interest payable quarterly. The Company
also entered into the Preferred Stock Agreement and received 5,000 shares of
MRYP Spinco Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per
share. In June 1999, MRYP Spinco repaid the entire outstanding Senior Note
balance of $18.3 million and the Subordinated Debt Agreement balance of $20.0
million and repurchased all 5,000 shares of the preferred stock for $2.7
million. There is no further obligation by either party in connection with
these agreements.




         In addition, MRY Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares of
Beneficial Interest were redesignated as the Company's 164,951 Series H
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest, $0.01 par
value per share (the "Series H Preferred Shares"), the MRY Series B
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest were
redesignated as the Company's 4,000,000 Series I Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest, $0.01 par value per share (the
"Series I Preferred Shares"), the MRY Series C Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest were redesignated as the Company's
4,599,400 Series J Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares of Beneficial
Interest, $0.01 par value per share (the "Series J Preferred Shares"), the
MRY Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest
were redesignated as the Company's 1,000,000 Series K Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest, $0.01 par value per share (the
"Series K Preferred Shares") and the MRY Series E Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest were redesignated as the Company's
4,000,000 Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial
Interest, $0.01 par value per share (the "Series L Preferred Shares"). During
1999, all of the Series I Preferred Shares were converted into 2,566,797
Common Shares of the Company. During 2000, all of the remaining Series J
Preferred Shares were converted into 2,822,012 Common Shares of the Company.

         On August 23, 1999, the Company sold its entire interest in the six
joint venture properties to MRYP Spinco and received $54.1 million. There is
no further obligation by either party in connection with the joint venture
agreements.

         On October 1, 1999, the Company completed the acquisition of the
multifamily property business of LFT through the LFT Merger. The transaction
was valued at approximately $738 million and included 402 Properties of LFT
containing 36,609 units. The purchase price consisted of:

     -    4.0 million Common Shares issued by the Company (each outstanding
          common share of beneficial interest of LFT was converted into .463 of
          a Common Share) with a market value of approximately $181.1 million;

     -    assumption of mortgage indebtedness and unsecured notes in the amount
          of $528.3 million;

     -    acquisition of other assets of approximately $40.9 million and
          assumption of other liabilities of approximately $25.3 million; and

     -   other merger related costs of approximately $24.5 million.

         On July 11, 2000, the Company acquired Globe in an all cash and debt
transaction valued at approximately $163.2 million. Globe provides fully
furnished short-term housing through an inventory of leased housing units to
transferring or temporarily assigned corporate personnel, new hires,
trainees, consultants and individual customers throughout the United States.
Additionally, Globe rents and sells furniture to a diversified base of
commercial and residential customers throughout the United States.
Shareholders of Globe received $13.00 per share, which approximated $58.7
million in cash based on the 4.5 million Globe shares outstanding. In
addition, the Company:

     -    Acquired $94.8 million in other Globe assets and assumed $29.6 million
          in other Globe liabilities.

     -    Allocated $68.4 million to goodwill;

     -    Recorded acquisition costs of $4.5 million; and

     -    Assumed $70.4 million in debt, which included $1.4 million in mortgage
          debt, $39.5 million in unsecured notes, and Globe's line of credit
          totaling $29.5 million;

         On July 21, 2000, the Company, through its Globe subsidiary,
acquired TQ, the leading corporate housing provider in Atlanta, Georgia, in a
$3.3 million all cash transaction.

         On October 31, 2000 the Company acquired Grove, which included 60
properties containing 7,308 units for a total purchase price of $463.2
million. The Company:

     -    Paid $17.00 per share or $141.6 million in cash to purchase the 8.3
          million outstanding common



          shares of Grove.

     -    Paid $17.00 per unit or $12.4 million in cash to purchase 0.7 million
          Grove OP Units outstanding at the merger date.

     -    Converted 2.1 million Grove OP Units to 0.8 of the Operating
          Partnership's OP units using the conversion ratio of 0.3696 (after
          cash-out of fractional units). The value of these converted OP units
          totaled $37.2 million.

     -    Assumed $241.3 million in Grove debt, which included first and second
          mortgages totaling $203.4 million and Grove's line of credit totaling
          $38.0 million. Grove's line of credit and two mortgage loans totaling
          $7.8 million were paid off immediately after the closing.

     -    Acquired $20.1 million in Grove assets and assumed $11.2 million in
          other Grove liabilities, including an earnout note payable liability
          totaling $1.5 million. This amount represents the estimated additional
          cash or OP Units required to be funded to the previous owners of Glen
          Meadow Apartments upon the transition of this property from subsidized
          to market rents.

     -    Recorded acquisition costs of $19.5 million.

          The Company accounted for the Mergers and acquisitions as purchases
in accordance with Accounting Principals Board Opinion No. 16. The fair value
of the consideration given by the Company was used as the valuation basis for
each of the combinations.

COMPETITION

         All of the Properties are located in developed areas that include
other multifamily properties. The number of competitive multifamily
properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the Company's
ability to lease units at the Properties or at any newly acquired properties
and on the rents charged. The Company may be competing with other entities
that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have more
experience than the Company's officers and trustees. In addition, other forms
of multifamily properties, including multifamily properties and manufactured
housing controlled by Mr. Zell, and single-family housing, provide housing
alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties.

RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS OMIT THE USE OF DEFINED TERMS USED ELSEWHERE
HEREIN AND CONTAIN DEFINED TERMS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE USED IN THE
OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS REPORT. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, WHEN USED IN THIS
SECTION, THE TERMS "WE" AND "US" REFER TO EQUITY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES TRUST
AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING ERP OPERATING LIMITED PARTNERSHIP.

         Set forth below are the risks that we believe are important to
investors who purchase or own our common shares of beneficial interest or
preferred shares of beneficial interest (which we refer to collectively as
"Shares") or units of limited partnership interest ("Units") of ERP Operating
Limited Partnership, our operating partnership, which are redeemable on a
one-for-one basis for common shares or their cash equivalent. In this
section, we refer to the Shares and the Units together as our "securities,"
and the investors who own Shares and/or Units as our "security holders."

DEBT FINANCING AND PREFERRED SHARES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PERFORMANCE




         GENERAL

         The Company's total debt summary, as of December 31, 2000, included:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Debt Summary as of 12/31/00
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


         In addition to debt, we have issued preferred shares of beneficial
interest. Our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain
risks, including the following.

         SCHEDULED DEBT PAYMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION

         In the future, our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required
payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities
at expected levels. We may not be able to refinance existing debt (which in
virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity) and,
if we can, the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the
terms of existing indebtedness. If principal payments due at maturity cannot
be refinanced, extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions,
such as new equity capital, our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years
to repay all maturing debt. As a result, we may be forced to postpone capital
expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties and may have to
dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be
unacceptable to us.

         FINANCIAL COVENANTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL
         CONDITION

         If a property we own is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness
and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments, the holder of the mortgage
could foreclose on the property, resulting in loss of income and asset value.
Foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing
indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition
and results of operations. A foreclosure could also result in our recognition
of taxable income without our actually receiving cash proceeds from the
disposition of the property with which to pay the tax. This could adversely
affect our cash flow and could make it more difficult for us to meet our
distribution requirements as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT").

         The mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative
covenants that, among other things, limit our ability, without the prior
consent of the lender, to further mortgage the property and to discontinue
insurance coverage. In addition, our credit facilities contain certain
customary restrictions,




requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. The
indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain
certain financial and operating covenants including, among other things,
maintenance of certain financial ratios, as well as limitations on our
ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness (including acquisition
financing), sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in
mergers, consolidations and certain acquisitions. Accordingly, in the event
that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of
these restrictions, our ability to acquire additional properties may be
limited. If we are unable to acquire additional properties, our ability to
increase the distributions to security holders, as we have done in the past,
will be limited to management's ability to increase funds from operations,
and thereby cash available for distributions, from the existing properties in
our portfolio at such time.

         Some of the properties were financed with tax-exempt bonds that
contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions. We have retained
an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive
covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties. If these bond
compliance requirements require us to lower our rental rates to attract low
or moderate income tenants, or eligible/qualified tenants, then our income
from these properties may be limited.

         OUR DEGREE OF LEVERAGE COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL
         FINANCING

         Our debt to market capitalization ratio (total debt as a percentage
of total debt plus the market value of the outstanding common and preferred
shares and units) was approximately 37.8% as of December 31, 2000. We have a
policy of incurring indebtedness for borrowed money only through the
Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries and only if upon such incurrence
our debt to market capitalization ratio would be approximately 50% or less.
Our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders.
For example, the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain
additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes, making us more
vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally.

         RISING INTEREST RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CASH FLOW

         Advances under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates
based upon LIBOR available at various interest periods, plus a certain spread
dependent upon the Company's credit rating. Certain of our senior unsecured
debt instruments also, from time to time, bear interest at floating rates. We
may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future.
Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expenses under these
debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing
indebtedness and of issuing new debt. Accordingly, higher interest rates
would adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to
make distributions to security holders.

CONTROL AND INFLUENCE BY SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDERS COULD BE EXERCISED IN A
MANNER ADVERSE TO OTHER SHAREHOLDERS

         GENERAL

         As of February 1, 2001, (1) Samuel Zell and certain of the current
holders of Units issued to affiliates of Mr. Zell, who contributed 33
properties to the Company at the time of our initial public offering, owned
in the aggregate approximately 2.7% of our common shares (Mr. Zell and these
affiliates are described herein as the "Zell Original Owners"); and (2) our
executive officers and trustees, excluding Mr. Zell (see disclosure above),
owned approximately 4.7% of our common shares. These percentages assume all
options are exercised for common shares and all Units are converted to common
shares. In addition, the consent of certain affiliates of Mr. Zell is
required for certain amendments to the Fifth Amended and Restated ERP
Operating Limited Partnership Agreement of Limited Partnership (the




"Partnership Agreement"). As a result of their security ownership and rights
concerning amendments to the Partnership Agreement, Mr. Zell may have
substantial influence over the Company. Although these security holders have
not agreed to act together on any matter, they would be in a position to
exercise even more influence over the Company's affairs if they were to act
together in the future. This influence might be exercised in a manner that is
inconsistent with the interests of other security holders.

         MR. ZELL AND OTHERS ARE EXEMPT FROM THE 5% OWNERSHIP LIMIT GENERALLY
         APPLICABLE TO SECURITIES HOLDERS

         In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), not more than 50% of the value
of the outstanding Shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or
fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities). To
assure compliance with this test, our Declaration of Trust restricts the
ownership of more than 5% of the lesser of the number or value of the
outstanding Shares by any single security holder, subject to certain
exceptions. These restrictions do not apply to the ownership of common shares
that may be acquired by the holders of Units issued to the Zell Original
Owners and the Starwood owners. Additionally, our Declaration of Trust
exempts any transferees of such common shares from the 5% ownership limit,
provided such transfers do not result in an increased concentration in the
ownership.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS ARE POSSIBLE AND CAN BE COSTLY

         Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or
operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic
substances or petroleum product releases at such property. The owner or
operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property
damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in
connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up
responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator
knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one
person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by
the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs
incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site
for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating
from that site.

         Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal
of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings
containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they
notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they
undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if
asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building.
These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who
fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek
recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with
exposure to asbestos fibers.

         Substantially all of our properties have been the subject of
environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental
consultant companies. These environmental assessments have not revealed, nor
are we aware of, any environmental liability that our management believes
would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition or liquidity.

         We cannot assure you that existing environmental assessments of our
properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of any
of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known
to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as
to any one or more of our properties.

OUR PERFORMANCE AND SHARE VALUE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REAL
ESTATE INDUSTRY




         GENERAL

         Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and
are relatively illiquid. Several factors may adversely affect the economic
performance and value of our properties. These factors include changes in the
national, regional and local economic climate, local conditions such as an
oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our
multifamily properties, the attractiveness of our properties to tenants,
competition from other available multifamily property owners and changes in
market rental rates. Our performance also depends on our ability to collect
rent from tenants and to pay for adequate maintenance, insurance and other
operating costs, including real estate taxes, which could increase over time.
Also, the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily
reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a
reduction in income from the property.

         WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RENEW LEASES OR RELET SPACE AS LEASES EXPIRE

         When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon expiration,
we may not be able to relet their space. Even if the tenants do renew or we
can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable
than current lease terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or
relet the space, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are
significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and
financial condition will be adversely affected. Consequently, our cash flow
and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders would
be reduced.

         NEW ACQUISITIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS MAY FAIL TO PERFORM AS EXPECTED AND
         COMPETITION FOR ACQUISITIONS MAY RESULT IN INCREASED PRICES FOR
         PROPERTIES

         We intend to continue to actively acquire or develop multifamily
properties. Newly acquired or developed properties may fail to perform as
expected. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired
property up to standards established for its intended market position or to
develop a property. Additionally, we expect that other major real estate
investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive
investment opportunities. This competition has increased prices for
multifamily properties. We may not be in a position or have the opportunity
in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms.

         BECAUSE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS ARE ILLIQUID, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
         SELL PROPERTIES WHEN APPROPRIATE

         Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not
be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other
conditions. This inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance
of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability
to make distributions to our security holders.

         CHANGES IN LAWS COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

         We are generally not able to pass through to our tenants under
existing leases increases in real estate taxes, income taxes and service or
other taxes. Consequently, any such increases may adversely affect our
financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our
security holders. Similarly, changes that increase our potential liability
under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance
would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our
securities.

SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO EFFECT CHANGES IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY IS LIMITED




         PROVISIONS OF OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST AND BYLAWS COULD INHIBIT
         CHANGES IN CONTROL

         Certain provisions of our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws may delay
or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transactions that
could provide the security holders with a premium over the then-prevailing
market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best
interest of our security holders. These include a staggered Board of Trustees
and the 5% Ownership Limit described below. See "-We Have a Share Ownership
Limit for REIT Tax Purposes." Also, any future series of preferred shares of
beneficial interest may have certain voting provisions that could delay or
prevent a change of control or other transactions that might otherwise be in
the interest of our security holders.

         WE HAVE A SHARE OWNERSHIP LIMIT FOR REIT TAX PURPOSES

         To remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, not
more than 50% in value of our outstanding Shares may be owned, directly or
indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of
any year. To facilitate maintenance of our REIT qualification, our
Declaration of Trust, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits ownership by
any single shareholder of more than 5% of the lesser of the number or value
of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares. See "-Control and
Influence by Significant Shareholders-Mr. Zell and Others are Exempt from the
5% Ownership Limit Generally Applicable to Securities Holders." We refer to
this restriction as the "Ownership Limit." Absent any exemption or waiver,
securities acquired or held in violation of the Ownership Limit will be
transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable
beneficiary, and the security holder's rights to distributions and to vote
would terminate. A transfer of Shares may be void if it causes a person to
violate the Ownership Limit. The Ownership Limit could delay or prevent a
change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our security
holders' ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price
for their Shares.

         OUR PREFERRED SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST MAY AFFECT CHANGES IN
         CONTROL

         Our Declaration of Trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to issue
up to 100 million preferred shares of beneficial interest, and to establish
the preferences and rights (including the right to vote and the right to
convert into common shares) of any preferred shares issued. The Board of
Trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of
such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even
if a change in control were in the interest of security holders. As of
December 31, 2000, 20,003,166 preferred shares were issued and outstanding.

         INAPPLICABILITY OF MARYLAND LAW LIMITING CERTAIN CHANGES IN CONTROL

         Certain provisions of Maryland law applicable to real estate
investment trusts prohibit "business combinations" (including certain
issuances of equity securities) with any person who beneficially owns ten
percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities, or with an
affiliate who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in
question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power
of the trust's outstanding voting securities (an "Interested Shareholder"),
or with an affiliate of an Interested Shareholder. These prohibitions last
for five years after the most recent date on which the Interested Shareholder
became an Interested Shareholder. After the five-year period, a business
combination with an Interested Shareholder must be approved by two
super-majority shareholder votes unless, among other conditions, the trust's
holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the
consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by
the Interested Shareholder for its common shares. As permitted by Maryland
law, however, the Board of Trustees of the Company has opted out of these
restrictions with respect to any business combination involving the Zell
Original Owners and persons acting in concert with any of the Zell Original
Owners. Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote
requirements




will not apply to a business combination involving us and any of them. Such
business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders.

OUR SUCCESS AS A REIT IS DEPENDENT ON COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL INCOME TAX
REQUIREMENTS

         OUR FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT WOULD HAVE SERIOUS ADVERSE
         CONSEQUENCES TO OUR SECURITY HOLDERS

         We believe that we have qualified for taxation as a REIT for federal
income tax purposes since our taxable year ended December 31, 1992. We plan
to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these
requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. We cannot,
therefore, guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as
a REIT. The determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of various
factual matters that may not be totally within our control. For example, to
qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from sources
that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. We are also required to distribute to
security holders at least 95% of our REIT taxable income excluding capital
gains. The fact that we hold our assets through ERP Operating Limited
Partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the
REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize
our REIT status. Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the
tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings that make it
more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a REIT. We do
not believe, however, that any pending or proposed tax law changes would
jeopardize our REIT status.

         If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal
income tax at regular corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS granted us relief
under certain statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a REIT
for four years following the year we first failed to qualify. If we fail to
qualify as a REIT, we would have to pay significant income taxes. We,
therefore, would have less money available for investments or for
distributions to security holders. This would likely have a significant
adverse affect on the value of our securities. In addition, we would no
longer be required to make any distributions to security holders.

         WE COULD BE DISQUALIFIED AS A REIT OR HAVE TO PAY TAXES IF OUR
         MERGER PARTNERS DID NOT QUALIFY AS REIT'S

         If any of our recent merger partners had failed to qualify as a REIT
throughout the duration of their existence, then they might have had
undistributed "C corporation earnings and profits" at the time of their
merger with us. If that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings
and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place, we
might not qualify as a REIT. We believe that each of our merger partners
qualified as a REIT and that, in any event, none of them had any
undistributed "C corporation earnings and profits" at the time of their
merger with us. If any of our merger partners failed to qualify as a REIT, an
additional concern would be that they would have recognized taxable gain at
the time they were merged with us. We would be liable for the tax on such
gain. In this event, we would have to pay corporate income tax on any gain
existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the
merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger. Finally, we
could be precluded from electing REIT status for up to four years after the
year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for REIT status.

         OTHER TAX LIABILITIES

         Even if we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to certain federal,
state and local taxes on our income and property. In addition, our
third-party management operations, which are conducted through subsidiaries,
generally will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.




WE DEPEND ON OUR KEY PERSONNEL

         We depend on the efforts of the Chairman of our Board of Trustees,
Samuel Zell, and our executive officers, particularly Douglas Crocker II and
Gerald A. Spector. If they resign, our operations could be temporarily
adversely effected. Mr. Crocker and Mr. Spector have entered into Deferred
Compensation Agreements with the Company which provide both with a salary
benefit after their respective termination of employment with the Company. In
addition, Mr. Zell, Mr. Crocker and Mr. Spector have entered into
Noncompetition Agreements with the Company.

COMPLIANCE WITH REIT DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION

         DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS MAY INCREASE THE INDEBTEDNESS OF THE COMPANY

         We may be required from time to time, under certain circumstances,
to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet
received. In such event, or upon our repayment of principal on debt, we could
have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the
distribution requirements of a REIT. Accordingly, we could be required to
borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these
distribution requirements.

         WE ARE DEPENDENT ON EXTERNAL SOURCES OF CAPITAL

         Because of our annual REIT distribution requirements, we may not be
able to fund all future capital needs, including for acquisitions and
developments, from income generated by operations and the disposition of
certain assets. We therefore may have to rely on third-party sources of
capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our
access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things,
including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and
potential future earnings. Moreover, additional equity offerings, if pursued,
may result in dilution of security holders' interests, and additional debt
financing may increase our leverage.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

         GENERAL

         The following discussion summarizes all of the federal income tax
considerations material to a holder of common shares. It is not exhaustive of
all possible tax considerations. For example, it does not give a detailed
discussion of any state, local or foreign tax considerations. The following
discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to
prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances.
Moreover, it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to
shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws, such as
insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or
broker-dealers, foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or
residents of the United States.

         The specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a
material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase,
ownership and disposition of common shares. Therefore, it is essential that
each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with
regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder's
personal tax situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the
laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

         OUR TAXATION

         We elected REIT status beginning with the year that ended December
31, 1992. In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be
subject to federal income tax on the portion of our




REIT taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders.
This treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to
most corporations, which pay a tax on their income and then distribute
dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive.
However, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates
upon our REIT taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our
shareholders. We also may be subject to the corporate "alternate minimum tax"
on items of preference under this alternative tax regime. In addition, we
will be subject to a 4% excise tax if we do not satisfy specific REIT
distribution requirements. Moreover, we may be subject to taxes in certain
situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate.

         If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, we
will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We
also may be subject to the corporate "alternate minimum tax." As a result,
our failure to qualify as a REIT would significantly reduce the cash we have
available to distribute to our shareholders. Unless entitled to statutory
relief, we would be disqualified from qualification as a REIT for the four
taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is
not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief.

         Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our ability to
satisfy various requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. We are required
to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual
operating and other results. These requirements relate to the sources of our
gross income, the composition of our assets, the amount of dividends we pay
to shareholders, the diversity of our share ownership, and other aspects of
our operations. The purpose of these requirements is to allow the tax benefit
of REIT status only to companies that:

         (a)      primarily own, and primarily derive income from, real
                  estate-related assets and certain other assets which are
                  passive in nature, and

         (b)      distribute 95% of the taxable income, 90% for taxable years
                  beginning January 1, 2001, computed without regard to net
                  capital gain, to shareholders.

         On December 17, 1999, as part of a larger bill, the President signed
into law the REIT Modernization Act ("RMA"). Effective beginning January 1,
2001, the RMA has amended the tax rules relating to the composition of a
REIT's assets. Under prior law, a REIT was precluded from owning more than
10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer, other than a
wholly owned subsidiary or another REIT. Beginning in 2001, a REIT will
remain subject to this current restriction and will also be precluded from
owning more than 10% of the value of all classes of any one issuer.

         There is an exception to this prohibition. A REIT will be allowed to
own up to 100% of the securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") that
can provide services to REIT tenants and others without disqualifying the
rents that a REIT receives from its tenants. However, no more than 20% of the
value of a REIT's total assets can be represented by securities of one or
more TRS's. The amount of debt and rental payments from a TRS to a REIT will
be limited to ensure that a TRS is subject to an appropriate level of
corporate tax. The new 10% asset test will not apply to certain arrangements
(including third party subsidiaries) in place on July 12, 1999, provided that
a subsidiary does not engage in a "substantial" new line of business, its
existing business does not increase, and a REIT does not acquire any new
securities in the subsidiary. Under the RMA, a third party subsidiary will be
able to convert tax free into a TRS.

         In addition to the above legislative changes, effective January 1,
2001, the distribution of taxable income requirement of a REIT has been
reduced from 95% to 90%. Further, effective January 1, 2001, the 15% personal
property test (which generally requires that a REIT's personal property not
exceed 15% of its real and personal property in order for income to be
considered rents from real property) will be based on fair market values
instead of adjusted tax basis.




         We believe that we have qualified as a REIT for all of our taxable
years beginning with 1992. We also believe that our current structure and
method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a REIT.
However, we cannot guarantee that the actual results of our operations have
satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the Internal Revenue Code.

         Piper, Marbury, Rudnick & Wolfe, our special tax counsel, will
provide an opinion to the effect that we were organized and have operated in
conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT
under the Internal Revenue Code for each of our taxable years beginning in
1992. The opinion will also provide that our current organization and method
of operation should enable us to continue to meet the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT. It must be emphasized that the opinion
will be based on various assumptions and factual representations relating to
our organization and our prior and expected operations. In each case, these
representations include representations about our predecessors. Piper,
Marbury, Rudnick & Wolfe will not review our compliance with these
requirements on a continuing basis.

         TAXATION OF TAXABLE DOMESTIC SHAREHOLDERS

         General. If we qualify as a REIT, distributions made to our taxable
domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares, other than capital
gain distributions, will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the
distributions come out of earnings and profits. These distributions will not
be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are
corporations. In determining whether distributions are out of earnings and
profits, we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares
and second to the common shares. We cannot guarantee that we will have
sufficient earnings and profits to cover distributions on the preferred
shares.

         To the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic
shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits, such distributions will
be considered a return of capital. Such distributions will be treated as a
tax free distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder's common
shares by the amount of the distribution so treated. To the extent that such
distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder's tax basis,
such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of his shares.
Shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of
our net operating losses or capital losses.

         Distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain
dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the
sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year. This
treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not
exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year. It applies
regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her
common shares. Despite this general rule, corporate shareholders may be
required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary
income.

         Generally, we will classify a portion of our designated capital
gains dividend as a 20% rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as
an unrecaptured Section 1250 gain distribution. As the names suggest, a 20%
rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that
are individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20%. An unrecaptured
Section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic
shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25%.

         If, for any taxable year, we elect to designate as capital gain
dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to
holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest, then the portion of
the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common
shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction. The
numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available
to the holders of the common shares for the year. The denominator of




the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of
all classes of shares of beneficial interest.

         In general, a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal
income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an
amount equal to the difference between:

         (a)      the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property
                  received in the sale or other disposition, and

         (b)      the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the common shares.

         The gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares
were held as a capital asset. Generally, the capital gain or loss will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than
one year. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 allows the IRS to issue regulations
relating to the manner in which capital gain rates will apply to sales of
capital assets by REIT's and to sales of interests in REIT's. The IRS has not
issued these regulations. However, if the IRS does issue these regulations,
they could affect the taxation of gain and loss realized on the disposition
of common shares. Shareholders are urged to consult with their own tax
advisors with respect to the rules contained in the Taxpayer Relief Act.

         In general, a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of
common shares that were held for six months or less, determined after
applying certain holding period rules, will be treated as long-term capital
loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were
treated as long-term capital gains. For shareholders who are individuals,
trusts and estates, the long-term capital loss will be apportioned among the
applicable long-term capital gain rates to the extent that distributions
received by the shareholder were previously so treated.

         We may elect to retain (rather than distribute as is generally
required) net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that
gain. If we make this election, shareholders must include in income, as
long-term capital gain, their proportionate share of the undistributed net
capital gain. Shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate
share of the tax paid by us on these gains. Accordingly, they will receive a
credit or refund for the amount. Shareholders will increase the basis in
their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain
included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having
paid. Our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately.

         TAXATION OF TAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS

         Most tax-exempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax
except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income, which is
often referred to as UBTI. Unless a tax-exempt shareholder holds its common
shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated
trade or business, distributions to the shareholder should not constitute
UBTI. Similarly, if a tax-exempt shareholder sells common shares, the income
from the sale should not constitute UBTI unless the shareholder held the
shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business.

         However, for tax-exempt shareholders that are social clubs,
voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit
trusts, and qualified group legal services plans, income from owning or
selling common shares will constitute UBTI unless the organization is able to
properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the
income generated by its investment in common shares. These shareholders
should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve
requirements which are set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.

         In addition, certain pension trusts that own more than 10% of a
pension-held REIT must report a




portion of the distributions that they receive from the REIT as UBTI. We have
not been and do not expect to be treated as a pension-held REIT for purposes
of this rule.

         TAXATION OF FOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS

         The following is a discussion of certain anticipated United States
federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common
shares applicable to a foreign shareholder. It is based on current law and is
for general information only. A "foreign shareholder" is any person other
than:

         (a)     a citizen or resident of the United States,

         (b)      a corporation or partnership created or organized in the
                  United States or under the laws of the United States or of any
                  state thereof, or

         (c)      an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income
                  for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of
                  its source.

         Distributions by Us. Distributions by us to a foreign shareholder
that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of United
States real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains
dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that
they are made out of our earnings and profits. These distributions ordinarily
will be subject to withholding of United States federal income tax on a gross
basis at a 30% rate, or a lower treaty rate, unless the dividends are treated
as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a
United States trade or business. Please note that under certain treaties
lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to
dividends from REIT's. Dividends that are effectively connected with a United
States trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated
rates, and are generally not subject to withholding. Certification and
disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from
withholding under this exemption. A foreign shareholder that is a corporation
also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or a
lower treaty rate.

         We expect to withhold United States income tax at the rate of 30% on
any distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless:

         (a)      a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or
                  certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is
                  filed with us, or

         (b)      the foreign shareholder files an IRS Form 4224 with us
                  claiming that the distribution is effectively connected
                  income.

         A distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and
profits will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the
distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder's common
shares. Instead, the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the
common shares. To the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis
of the common shares, it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of
the shareholder's common shares. The tax treatment of this gain is described
below.

         As a result of a legislative change made by the Small Business Job
Protection Act of 1996, it appears that we will be required to withhold 10%
of any distribution in excess of our earnings and profits. Consequently,
although we intend to withhold at a rate of 30%, or a lower applicable treaty
rate, on the entire amount of any distribution, to the extent that we do not
do so, distributions will be subject to withholding at a rate of 10%.
However, a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from
the IRS if it subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in
excess of our earnings and profits, and the amount withheld exceeded the
foreign shareholder's United States tax liability with respect to the
distribution.




         Distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time
of the distributions as capital gain dividends, other than those arising from
the disposition of a United States real property interest, generally will not
be subject to United States federal income taxation unless:

       (a)     the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with
               the foreign shareholder's United States trade or business, in
               which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same
               treatment as domestic shareholders, except that a shareholder
               that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch
               profits tax, as discussed above, or

       (b)     the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is
               present in the United States for 183 days or more during the
               taxable year and has a "tax home" in the United States, in which
               case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30%
               tax on the individual's capital gains.

         Under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, which is
known as FIRPTA, distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable
to gain from sales or exchanges of United States real property interests will
cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income
effectively connected with a United States trade or business. This rule
applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain
dividend. Accordingly, foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these
distributions at the same rates applicable to U.S. shareholders, subject to a
special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals.
In addition, a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch
profits tax discussed above. We are required to withhold 35% of these
distributions. The withheld amount can be credited against the foreign
shareholder's United States federal income tax liability.

         Although the law is not entirely clear on the matter, it appears
that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the
common shares held by U.S. shareholders would be treated with respect to
foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital
gain dividends. Under that approach, foreign shareholders would be able to
offset as a credit against the United States federal income tax liability
their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed
capital gains. In addition, foreign shareholders would be able to receive
from the IRS a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid
by us were to exceed their actual United States federal income tax liability.

         SALES OF COMMON SHARES. Gain recognized by a foreign shareholder
upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to
United States taxation unless the shares constitute a "United States real
property interest" within the meaning of FIRPTA. The common shares will not
constitute a United States real property interest so long as we are a
domestically controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in
which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value
of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders. We
believe that we are a domestically controlled REIT. Therefore, we believe
that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under FIRPTA.
However, because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded, we
cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled REIT.
In any event, gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise
subject to FIRPTA will be taxable to a foreign shareholder if either:

       (a)     the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with
               the foreign shareholder's United States trade or business, in
               which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same
               treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain, or

       (b)     the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is
               present in the United States for 183 days or more during the
               taxable year and has a tax home in the United States, in which
               case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30%
               tax on the individual's




               capital gains.

         Even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically
controlled REIT, gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign
shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to United States
taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a United States real property interest if:

       (a)     the class or series of shares being sold is "regularly traded,"
               as defined by applicable IRS regulations, on an established
               securities market such as the New York Stock Exchange, and

       (b)     the selling foreign shareholder owned 5% or less of the value of
               the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout
               the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange.

         If gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to
taxation under FIRPTA, the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular
United States income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a
taxable U.S. shareholder, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax,
a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien
individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the
case of foreign corporations. The purchaser of the common shares would be
required to withhold and remit to the IRS 10% of the purchase price.

         OUR MANAGEMENT COMPANY AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. A small portion of
the cash to be used by the Operating Partnership to fund distributions to us
is expected to come from payments of dividends on non-voting stock of
management companies and other companies held by the Operating Partnership.
These companies pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable
corporate rates. They will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes, but
we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to, which measures taken to
minimize these taxes, will be successful. To the extent that these companies
are required to pay taxes, the cash available for distribution from these
management companies by us to shareholders will be reduced accordingly.

         STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. We and our shareholders may be subject to
state or local taxation in various jurisdictions, including those in which it
or they transact business or reside. The state and local tax treatment of us
and our shareholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequence
discussed above. It is our belief that all the states will eventually conform
with the RMA as described above. Consequently, prospective shareholders
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local
tax laws on an investment in common shares.




ITEM 2.  THE PROPERTIES

         As of December 31, 2000, the Company owned or had interests in a
portfolio of 1,104 multifamily Properties located in 36 states containing
227,704 apartment units. The Company has:



         Tenant leases are generally year-to-year and require security
deposits. The garden-style properties are generally defined as properties
with two and/or three floors while the mid-rise/high-rise properties are
defined as properties greater than three floors. These two property types
typically provide residents with amenities, which may include a clubhouse,
swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television access. Certain of
these properties offer additional amenities such as saunas, whirlpools, spas,
sports courts and exercise rooms or other amenities. The ranch-style
properties, which are defined as single story properties, generally do not
provide additional amenities for residents other than common laundry
facilities and cable television access.

         It is management's role to monitor compliance with Property policies
and to provide preventive maintenance of the Properties including common
areas, facilities and amenities. The Company holds periodic meetings of its
Property management personnel for training and implementation of the
Company's strategies. The Company believes that, due in part to this
strategy, the Properties historically have had high occupancy rates.

         The distribution of the Properties throughout the United States
reflects the Company's belief that geographic diversification helps insulate
the portfolio from regional and economic influences. At the same time, the
Company has sought to create clusters of Properties within each of its
primary markets in order to achieve economies of scale in management and
operation; however, the Company may acquire additional multifamily properties
located anywhere in the United States.

         The Company beneficially owns fee simple title to 991 of the 998
controlled properties and holds a remaining 66-year leasehold interest with
respect to one Property (Mallgate). In addition, with respect to two
Properties, the Company owns the debt collateralized by such Properties and
with respect to four Properties, the Company owns an interest in the debt
collateralized by the Properties. The remaining 106 properties represent
Partially Owned and Unconsolidated Properties containing 20,094 units.

         Direct fee simple title for certain of the Properties is owned by
single-purpose nominee corporations, LLC's or land trusts that engage in no
business other than holding title to the Property for the benefit of the
Company. Holding title in such a manner is expected to make it less costly to
transfer such Property in the future in the event of a sale and should
facilitate financing, since lenders often require title to a Property to be
held in a single purpose entity in order to isolate that Property from
potential liabilities of other Properties. Direct fee simple title for
certain other Properties is owned by a single LLC.

         The Company also leases (under operating leases) various management,
regional and corporate offices throughout the United States.




         The following tables set forth certain information by type and state
relating to the Properties at December 31, 2000.

                             GARDEN-STYLE PROPERTIES






                          MID-RISE/HIGH-RISE PROPERTIES



                             RANCH-STYLE PROPERTIES






The properties currently under development are included in the following table.

                              DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS



(1)  The Company's funding of Lincoln Property Company Joint Venture and
     Legacy Partners Joint Venture Projects is limited to 25% of the total
     development cost.

(2)  Estimated development cost does not include the cost of land previously
     acquired by the Company.

(3)  Properties were substantially complete as of December 31, 2000. As such,
     these properties are also included in the outstanding property and unit
     counts.





ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         Only ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, which is
not deemed material, was initiated during the year ended December 31, 2000. As
of December 31, 2000, the Company does not believe there is any other litigation
threatened against the Company other than routine litigation arising out of the
ordinary course of business, some of which is expected to be covered by
liability insurance, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect
on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

   (FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT FOR PER SHARE AND PROPERTY DATA)






ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL (CONTINUED))

(1)      Funds from Operations ("FFO") represents net income (loss) (computed
     in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
     United States (("GAAP")), excluding gains or losses from sales of
     property, plus depreciation and amortization, adjustments for
     unconsolidated entities and extraordinary items. Adjustments for
     unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to
     reflect funds from operations on the same basis. This definition of FFO
     is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment
     Trust's ("NAREIT") recommended definition. NAREIT modified this
     definition effective January 1, 2000. Nevertheless, this modification
     had no impact upon the Company's calculation of FFO for either the
     current or prior periods presented.

         The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a
     supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate
     company because, along with cash flows from operating activities,
     financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors an
     understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt
     and to make capital expenditures. FFO in and of itself does not
     represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with
     GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income
     as an indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from
     operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and
     is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. The
     Company's calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for
     calculating FFO utilized by other real estate companies and may differ
     as a result of differences between the Company's and other real estate
     company's accounting policies for replacement type items and,
     accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.




ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         The acquired properties are presented in the Consolidated Financial
Statements of the Company from the date of each acquisition or the closing
dates of the Mergers. The following table summarizes the number of Acquired
and Disposed Properties and related units for the prior three years:






                                    PART III

         The Company's overall results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999 have been significantly impacted by the Company's
acquisition and disposition activity. The significant changes in rental
revenues, furniture income, property and maintenance expenses, real estate
taxes and insurance, furniture expenses, depreciation expense, property
management and interest expense can all primarily be attributed to the
acquisition of the 1999 Acquired Properties, the 2000 Acquired Properties and
the Globe acquisition, partially offset by the disposition of the 1999
Disposed Properties and the 2000 Disposed Properties. The impact of the 1999
Acquired Properties, the 2000 Acquired Properties, the Globe acquisition, the
1999 Disposed Properties and the 2000 Disposed Properties is discussed in
greater detail in the following paragraphs.

         Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2000 and 1999 (the
"2000 Same Store Properties"), which represented 155,910 units, impacted the
Company's results of operations. Properties that the Company owned for all of
both 1999 and 1998 (the "1999 Same Store Properties"), which represented
121,490 units, also impacted the Company's results of operations. Both the
2000 Same Store Properties and 1999 Same Store Properties are discussed in
the following paragraphs.

         COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 TO THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1999

         For the year ended December 31, 2000, income before allocation to
Minority Interests, income from investments in unconsolidated entities, net
gain on sales of real estate and extraordinary items increased by $60.8
million, or 19.0%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 1999.

         Total revenues from the 2000 Same Store Properties increased by
approximately $65.0 million to $1.5 billion or 4.6% primarily as a result of
higher rental rates charged to new tenants and tenant renewals and an
increase in income from billing tenants for their share of utility costs (the
Company's "RUBS" program) as well as other ancillary services provided to
tenants. Overall, property operating expenses, which include property and
maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance and allocable property
management expenses, increased approximately $13.0 million or 2.5%. This
increase was primarily the result of higher expenses for on-site compensation
costs and an increase in real estate taxes on certain properties, but was
partially offset by lower leasing and advertising and administrative costs.

         Property management expenses include expenses associated with the
self-management of the Company's Properties. These expenses increased by
approximately $14.8 million primarily due to the continued expansion of the
Company's property management business and higher overall compensation
expenses. During 2000, the Company incurred the full year impact of assuming
the property management business of Lexford and also assumed management
offices in Cincinnati, Ohio and Norwood, Massachusetts related to the
acquisition of Globe and Grove, respectively. Also included in compensation
expense is the current year charge associated with the issuance of restricted
shares in 2000.

         Fee and asset management revenues and fee and asset management
expenses increased as a result of the Company continuing to manage Properties
that were either sold and/or contributed to various joint venture entities.

         Furniture income and furniture operating expenses are associated
with the operation of the furniture rental business assumed in connection
with the Globe acquisition.

         Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing
costs, increased by approximately $47.1 million. This increase was primarily
the result of an increase in the Company's weighted average indebtedness
outstanding which increased by $514 million and higher interest rates. The
Company's effective interest costs increased from 7.05% for the year ended
December 31, 1999 to 7.25% for the year ended December 31, 2000.

         General and administrative expenses, which include corporate
operating expenses, increased




approximately $4.1 million between the periods under comparison. This
increase was primarily due to the addition of corporate personnel and higher
overall compensation expenses including a current year expense associated
with the awarding of restricted shares to key employees in 2000. These
expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 1.30% for the year
ended December 31, 2000 as compared to 1.28% of total revenues for the year
ended December 31, 1999.

         Net loss from extraordinary items increased approximately $5.1
million related primarily to pre-payment penalties incurred on the
refinancing of $208 million in mortgage debt.

         Income from investment in unconsolidated entities increased by
approximately $7.1 million related to preferred returns received on joint
venture agreements.

         COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 TO THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1998

         For the year ended December 31, 1999, income before allocation to
Minority Interests, income from investments in unconsolidated entities, net
gain from sales of real estate and extraordinary items increased by $67.9
million, or 27.0%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 1998.

         Total revenues from the 1999 Same Store Properties increased by
approximately $35.8 million to $1.1 billion or 3.5% primarily as a result of
higher rental rates charged to new tenants and tenant renewals and an
increase in income from billing tenants for their share of utility costs as
well as other ancillary services provided to tenants. Overall, property
operating expenses, which include property and maintenance, real estate taxes
and insurance and an allocation of property management expenses, increased
approximately $0.1 million or 0.03%. This increase was primarily the result
of higher expenses for on-site compensation costs and an increase in real
estate taxes on certain properties, but was partially offset by lower leasing
and advertising, administrative, maintenance and property management costs.

         Property management expenses increased by approximately $8.5 million
primarily due to the continued expansion of the Company's property management
business. During 1999, the Company assumed a management office in
Reynoldsburg, Ohio related to the LFT Merger.

         Fee and asset management revenues and fee and asset management
expenses decreased due to the Company acquiring certain previously
fee-managed only properties.

         Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing
costs, increased by approximately $91.9 million. This increase was primarily
the result of an increase in the Company's weighted average indebtedness
outstanding which increased by $1.3 billion. However, the Company's effective
interest costs decreased from 7.10% for the year ended December 31, 1998 to
7.05% for the year ended December 31, 1999.

General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating
expenses, increased approximately $1.7 million between the periods under
comparison. This increase was primarily due to the addition of corporate
personnel. However, by gaining certain economies of scale with a much larger
operation these expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.28% for the
year ended December 31, 1999 compared to 1.55% of total revenues for the year
ended December 31, 1998.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000

         As of January 1, 2000, the Company had approximately $29.1 million
of cash and cash equivalents and $400 million available on its lines of
credit, of which $65.8 million was restricted. After




taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following
paragraphs, the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31,
2000 was approximately $23.8 million and the amount available on the
Company's line of credit was $400 million, of which $53.5 million was
restricted. The following discussion also explains the changes in net cash
provided by operating activities, net cash used for investing activities and
net cash used for financing activities, all of which are presented in the
Company's Statements of Cash Flows.

         Part of the Company's strategy in funding the purchase of
multifamily properties, funding its Properties in the development stage and
the funding of the Company's investment in joint ventures with multifamily
real estate developers is to utilize its line of credit and to subsequently
repay the line of credit from the issuance of additional equity or debt
securities or the net proceeds from the disposition of Properties. Utilizing
this strategy during 2000, the Company:

     -    obtained the mortgage financing on forty-six previously unencumbered
          Properties and received net proceeds of $484.4 million;

     -    disposed of fifty-three properties (including the sale of the
          Company's entire interest in three Unconsolidated Properties) and
          received net proceeds of $631.2 million;

     -    sold and/or contributed thirty-four properties to three separate joint
          ventures and received net proceeds of $97.0 million;

     -    issued approximately 0.9 million Common Shares and received net
          proceeds of $32.9 million;

     -    issued five new series of Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preference
          Units and received net proceeds of $142.4 million; and

         All of these proceeds were utilized to:

     -    repay the lines of credit;

     -    repay mortgage indebtedness on selected Properties and/or repay
          unsecured notes;

     -    repay public unsecured debt;

     -    invest in unconsolidated entities;

     -    purchase additional Properties.

         During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company:

     -    repaid four unsecured note issues totaling $208.0 million;

     -    repaid approximately $171.8 million of mortgage indebtedness on
          eighty-three Properties;

     -    funded $160.9 million related to the development, earnout, and joint
          venture agreements;

     -    purchased twenty-eight Properties (excluding Grove) for a total
          purchase price of approximately $654.1 million;

     -    funded $1.4 million to acquire the remaining interest it did not own
          in Brunswick Apartments;

     -    funded $3.8 million to acquire the remaining interest it did not own
          in LFT's CNL portfolio (10 Properties);

     -    funded $58.5 million related to the purchase of two separate vacant
          land parcels for future development;

     -    funded $1.25 million to acquire an additional ownership interest in
          LFT's Guilford portfolio; and

     -    acquired $25.0 million of 8.25% preferred securities of WRP
          Convertible Trust I, an affiliate of WRP Newco.

         From January 1, 2001 to February 15, 2001, the Company:

     -    acquired Suerte Apartments, a 272-unit property located in San Diego,
          California for approximately $37.5 million (assumed mortgage debt of
          approximately $18.5 million), Westside Villas VI, an 18-unit property
          located in Los Angeles, California for $4.6 million and Riverview
          Apartments, a 92-




          unit property located in Norwalk, Connecticut for $9.6 million
          (assumed mortgage debt of $6.3 million).

     -    disposed of Meadowood II Apartments in Indianapolis, Indiana for $1.3
          million, Concorde Bridge Apartments in Overland Park, Kansas for $15.6
          million and Springs of Country Woods in Salt Lake City, Utah for $31.0
          million.

     -    funded $12.4 million to pay off at maturity the mortgage debt on two
          properties.

     -    funded $11.6 million related to the development, earnout and joint
          venture agreements.

     -    entered into two $100 million forward starting swaps commencing on
          March 1, 2001 and expiring on March 1, 2011. The Company will pay an
          interest rate of 5.958% on the first $100 million and 5.965% on the
          second $100 million and will receive an interest rate of 90-day LIBOR
          under both swaps.

         As of December 31, 2000, the Company had total indebtedness of
approximately $5.7 billion. Mortgage indebtedness aggregated $3.2 billion
(including premiums of $1.2 million), inclusive of $838.3 million of
tax-exempt bond indebtedness. Unsecured debt, aggregated $2.5 billion
(including net discounts and premiums of $1.2 million), inclusive of $127.8
million tax-exempt bond indebtedness.

         The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
("SFAS") No. 133/138, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities on January 1, 2001. This new accounting standard requires
companies to carry all derivative instruments, including certain embedded
derivatives, in the statement of financial condition at fair value. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends
on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging
relationship and, if so, on the reason for holding it. The Company uses only
qualifying hedges that are designated specifically to reduce exposure to
interest rate risk by locking in the expected future cash payments on certain
liabilities. This is typically accomplished using an interest rate swap or
treasury lock collar. For financial reporting purposes, the gain or loss on
the effective portion of the interest rate hedge is recorded as a component
of equity, which becomes reclassified into earnings along with payments on
the hedged liability.

         Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133/138 in January 2001, the Company
recorded a net transition adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive
income and either an unrealized gain or loss on hedges at that time which did
not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and results
of operations. Adoption of the standard resulted in the Company recognizing a
derivative instrument liability. In general, the amount of volatility will
vary with the level of derivative activities during any period.

         In May 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate protection
agreement to effectively fix the interest rate cost of the Evans Withycombe
Financing Limited Partnership indebtedness to within a range of 5.6% to 6.0%
upon its refinancing. The agreement was for a notional amount of $131 million
with a settlement date of August 2001.

         In August 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement that fixed the Company's interest rate risk on a portion of the
Operating Partnership's variable rate tax-exempt bond indebtedness at a rate
of 3.65125%. This agreement was for a notional amount of $150 million with a
termination date of August 2003.

         In August 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement that fixed the Company's interest rate risk on a portion of the
Operating Partnership's variable rate tax-exempt bond




indebtedness at a rate of 3.683%. This agreement was for a notional amount of
$150 million with a termination date of August 2005.

         In November 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement that fixed the Company's interest rate on a portion of the
Operating Partnership's variable rate tax-exempt bond indebtedness at a rate
of 5.81%. This agreement was for a notional amount of $100 million with a
termination date of August 2003.

         The Company has a policy of capitalizing expenditures made for new
assets, including newly acquired properties and the costs associated with
placing these assets into service. Expenditures for improvements and
renovations that significantly enhance the value of existing assets or
substantially extend the useful life of an asset are also capitalized.
Expenditures for in-the-unit replacement-type items such as appliances,
draperies, carpeting and floor coverings, mechanical equipment and certain
furniture and fixtures is also capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary
maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred. With respect
to acquired properties, the Company has determined that it generally spends
$1,000 per unit during its first three years of ownership to fully improve
and enhance these properties to meet the Company's standards. In regard to
replacement-type items described above, the Company generally expects to
spend $250 per unit on an annual recurring basis.

         During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company's total
improvements to real estate approximated $137.4 million. Of this amount,
approximately $36.0 million, or $351 per unit, related to capital
improvements and major repairs for the 1998, 1999 and 2000 Acquired
Properties. Capital improvements and major repairs for all of the Company's
pre-EQR IPO properties and 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 Acquired
Properties approximated $35.4 million, or $330 per unit. Capital spent for
replacement-type items approximated $57.1 million, or $273 per unit. In
addition, approximately $6.3 million was spent on eight specific assets
related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets. Also included
in total improvements to real estate was approximately $0.8 million spent on
commercial/other assets and $1.8 million spent on the Partially Owned
Properties. Such improvements to real estate were primarily funded from net
cash provided by operating activities. Total improvements to real estate
budgeted for 2001 are estimated to be approximately $140.0 million.

         Also included in total capital expenditures for the Company was
approximately $5.4 million for non-real estate additions such as computer
software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold
improvements to the Company's property management offices and its corporate
offices. Such additions to non-real estate property were primarily funded
from net cash provided by operating activities. Total additions to non-real
estate property budgeted for 2001 are estimated to be approximately $6.0
million.

         The Company, through its Globe subsidiary, has a policy for
capitalizing expenditures made for rental furniture and property and
equipment, including new acquisitions and the costs associated with placing
these assets into service. Globe purchases furniture to replace furniture
that has been sold and to maintain adequate levels of rental furniture to
meet existing and new customer needs. Expenditures for property and equipment
that significantly enhance the value of existing assets or substantially
extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary
maintenance and repairs related to property and equipment are expensed as
incurred. For the period July 11, 2000 through December 31, 2000, total
additions to rental furniture and property and equipment approximated $14.5
million. Such additions to rental furniture and property and equipment were
primarily funded from working capital reserves and from net cash provided by
operating activities. Total additions to rental furniture and property and
equipment budgeted for 2001 are estimated to be approximately $25.0 million.

         Minority Interests as of December 31, 2000 increased by $155.6
million when compared to December 31, 1999. The primary factors that
contributed to changes in the book value of Minority Interest




during the year were:

     -    distributions declared to Minority Interests, which amounted to $38.8
          million for 2000 (excluding preference unit/interest distributions);

     -    the allocation of income from operations in the amount of $41.7
          million;

     -    the conversion of OP Units into Common Shares; and

     -    the issuance of Common Shares, OP Units, Preference Units and
          Preference Interests during 2000.

         Total distributions paid in 2000 amounted to $563.4 million, which
included certain distributions declared in the fourth quarters of 1999 and
2000. The Company paid a $0.815 per Common Share distribution on December 31,
2000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2000 to Common Shareholders and
Minority Interest holders of record as of December 20, 2000.

         The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements,
including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing Properties
and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, generally through
its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings
under its line of credit. The Company considers its cash provided by
operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and
payments of distributions. The Company also expects to meet its long-term
liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt
maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development
activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes
and equity securities including additional OP Units as well as from
undistributed FFO and proceeds received from the disposition of certain
Properties. In addition, the Company has certain uncollateralized Properties
available to secure for additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the
public capital markets are unavailable to the Company or the cost of
alternative sources of capital to the Company is too high.

         The Company has a revolving credit facility with Bank of America
Securities LLC and Chase Securities Inc. acting as joint lead arrangers to
provide the Operating Partnership with potential borrowings of up to $700
million. This line of credit matures in August 2002. As of February 15, 2001,
$200 million was outstanding under this facility at a weighted average
interest rate of 6.34%.

         In connection with the Globe Merger, the Company assumed a revolving
credit facility with Fifth Third Bank with potential borrowings of up to
$55.0 million. This line of credit matures in May, 2003. As of February 15,
2001, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.

         In connection with the Wellsford Merger, the Company provided a
credit enhancement with respect to certain tax-exempt bonds issued to finance
certain public improvements at a multifamily development project. As of
February 15, 2001, this enhancement was still in effect at a commitment
amount of $12.7 million.

         In connection with a joint venture, the Company has an obligation to
fund up to an additional $17.5 million to guarantee third party construction
financing.

         Pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement with Wellsford
Real Properties, Inc. ("WRP Newco"), the Company had agreed to purchase up to
1,000,000 shares of WRP Newco Series A Preferred at $25.00 per share on a
standby basis over a three-year period ending May 30, 2000. This agreement
was terminated on May 5, 2000, and, as such, the Company has no further
obligations under this agreement.

         On May 5, 2000, the Company acquired $25.0 million of 8.25%
preferred securities of WRP Convertible Trust I, an affiliate of WRP Newco.
The preferred securities are indirectly convertible into WRP Newco common
share under certain circumstances.




FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999

         As of January 1, 1999, the Company had approximately $4 million of
cash and cash equivalents and $330 million available on its lines of credit,
of which $12 million was restricted. After taking into effect the various
transactions discussed in the following paragraphs, the Company's cash and
cash equivalents balance at December 31, 1999 was approximately $29.1 million
and the amount available on the Company's line of credit was $400 million, of
which $65.8 million was restricted. The following discussion also explains
the changes in net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used for
investing activities and net cash provided by (used for) financing
activities, all of which are presented in the Company's Statements of Cash
Flows.

         Part of the Company's strategy in funding the purchase of
multifamily properties, funding its Properties in the development stage and
the funding of the Company's investment in joint ventures with multifamily
real estate developers is to utilize its line of credit and to subsequently
repay the line of credit from the issuance of additional equity or debt
securities or the disposition of Properties. Utilizing this strategy during
1999, the Company:

     -    issued the June 2004 Notes and received net proceeds of $298.0
          million;

     -    refinanced seven Properties and received additional proceeds of $78.5
          million;

     -    obtained new mortgage financing on eleven previously unencumbered
          properties and received net proceeds of $126.5 million;

     -    disposed of forty-two properties (including the sale of the Company's
          interest in six MRY joint venture properties) and received net
          proceeds of $383 million;

     -    issued 1.2 million Common Shares receiving net proceeds of $38.5
          million; and

     -    issued one Series of Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preference
          Interests receiving net proceeds of $39 million.

         All of these proceeds were utilized to either:

     -    purchase additional properties;

     -    provide funding for properties in the development stage; and/or

     -    repay the line of credit and mortgage indebtedness on certain
          Properties.

         During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company:

     -    assumed and/or entered into new mortgage indebtedness of
          approximately $69.9 million, issued OP Units with a value of $25.2
          million and issued Junior Convertible Preference Units with a value
          of $3.0 million with respect to the 1999 Acquired Properties. The
          total purchase price of the 1999 Acquired Properties was
          approximately $1.4 billion.

     -    repaid the 1999 Notes that matured on May 15, 1999 totaling $125
          million.

     -    repaid the 1999-A Notes that matured on November 24, 1999 totaling $25
          million

     -    repaid approximately $60.8 million of mortgage indebtedness on 31
          Properties.

     -    refinanced the debt on six existing properties totaling $45.0 million
          with new mortgage indebtedness totaling $65.7 million.

     -    funded $196.5 million related to the development, earnout and joint
          venture agreements.

         As of December 31, 1999, the Company had total indebtedness of
approximately $5.5 billion. Mortgage indebtedness aggregated $2.9 billion
(including premiums of $2.1 million), inclusive of $838 million of tax-exempt
bond indebtedness. Unsecured debt aggregated $2.3 billion (including net
discounts and premiums in the amount of $2.5 million), inclusive of $127.8
million of tax-exempt bond indebtedness.




FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

         The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO available to
Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Statements of Funds From Operations
          (Amounts in thousands, except per share and OP Unit amounts)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------



* INCLUDES $2,720, $1,009 AND $183 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000,
1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF DEPRECIATION
FROM UNCONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES. EXCLUDES $1,476 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER
31, 2000 RELATED TO THE MINORITY INTERESTS' SHARE OF DEPRECIATION FROM
PARTIALLY OWNED PROPERTIES.

** REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S PORTION OF LOSSES RELATED TO ITS INVESTMENT IN
BROADBAND RESIDENTIAL, INC. THESE EXPENSES HAVE BEEN ADDED BACK TO OPERATIONS
FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FFO. THE EFFECT OF INCLUDING THIS EXPENSE IN FFO
WOULD BE $(0.007) FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000.

         For the year ended December 31, 2000, Funds From Operations ("FFO")
available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $106.6 million, or 17.2%,
as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. For the year ended December
31, 1999, FFO increased $160.8 million, or 35.0%, as compared to the year
ended December 31, 1998.

         FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (("GAAP")),
excluding gains or losses from sales of property, plus




depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
entities and extraordinary items. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships
and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the
same basis. This definition of FFO is in accordance with the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trust's ("NAREIT") recommended
definition. NAREIT modified this definition effective January 1, 2000.
Nevertheless, this modification had no impact upon the Company's calculation
of FFO for either the current or prior periods presented.

         The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a
supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company
because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing
activities and investing activities, it provides investors an understanding
of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital
expenditures. FFO in and of itself does not represent cash generated from
operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be
considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's
performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by
GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash
available to fund cash needs. The Company's calculation of FFO may differ
from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other real estate
companies and may differ as a result of differences between the Company's and
other real estate company's accounting policies for replacement type items
and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.




ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

         The Company's future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to
financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates. Market risk is
the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. The
Company manages its market risk by matching projected cash inflows from
operating properties, financing activities and investing activities with
projected cash outflows to fund debt payments, acquisitions, capital
expenditures, distributions and other cash requirements. The Company also
utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk. Interest
rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed
rate basis. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes.

         The Company has total outstanding debt of approximately $5.7 billion at
December 31, 2000, of which approximately $821.0 million, or 14.4% is floating
rate debt, including the effects of any interest rate protection agreements. If
market rates of interest on the Company's floating rate debt increase by 61
basis points (a 10% increase), the increase in interest expense on the Company's
floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by
approximately $5.0 million. If market rates of interest on the Company's
floating rate debt decrease by 61 basis points (a 10% decrease), the decrease in
interest expense on the Company's floating rate debt would increase future
earnings and cash flows by approximately $5.0 million.

         These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical
interest rates and equity prices on the Company's financial instruments. These
analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic
activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a
change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further
mitigate its exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the
specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis
assumes no changes in the Company's financial structure.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders
Equity Residential Properties Trust

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Equity
Residential Properties Trust (the "Company") as of December 31, 2000 and 1999
and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2000. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item 14(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Equity
Residential Properties Trust at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

                       EQUITY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES TRUST
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.   BUSINESS AND FORMATION OF THE COMPANY

         Equity Residential Properties Trust, formed in March 1993, ("EQR"), is
a self-administered and self-managed equity real estate investment trust
("REIT"). As used herein, the term "Company" means EQR, and its subsidiaries, as
the survivor of the mergers between EQR and each of Wellsford Residential
Property Trust ("Wellsford") (the "Wellsford Merger"), Evans Withycombe
Residential, Inc. ("EWR") (the "EWR Merger"), Merry Land & Investment Company,
Inc. ("MRY") (the "MRY Merger") and Lexford Residential Trust ("LFT") (the "LFT
Merger") (collectively, the "Mergers"). The Company also includes Globe Business
Resources, Inc. ("Globe"), Temporary Quarters, Inc. ("TQ") and Grove Property
Trust ("Grove"). The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Section
856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code 1986, as amended (the "Code").

         The Company is engaged in the acquisition, disposition, ownership,
management and operation of multifamily properties. As of December 31, 2000, the
Company owned or had interests in a portfolio of 1,104 multifamily properties
containing 227,704 apartment units (individually a "Property" and collectively
the "Properties") located in 36 states throughout the United States consisting
of the following:




         The "Partially Owned Properties" are controlled and partially owned
by the Company but have partners with minority interests and are accounted
for under the consolidation method of accounting. The "Unconsolidated
Properties" are partially owned but not controlled by the Company and consist
of investments in partnership interests and/or subordinated mortgages that
are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

         The Company has formed a series of partnerships (the "Financing
Partnerships") which beneficially own certain Properties that may be encumbered
by mortgage indebtedness. In general, these are structured so that ERP Operating
Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), a subsidiary of EQR, owns a
1% limited partner interest and a 98% general partner interest in each, with the
remaining 1% general partner interest in each Financing Partnership owned by
various qualified REIT subsidiaries wholly owned by the Company (each a "QRS
Corporation"). Rental income from the Properties that are beneficially owned by
a Financing Partnership is used first to service the applicable mortgage debt
and pay other operating expenses and any excess is then distributed 1% to the
applicable QRS Corporation, as the general partner of such Financing
Partnership, and 99% to the Operating Partnership, as the sole 1% limited
partner and as the 98% general partner. The Company has also formed a series of
limited liability companies that own certain Properties (collectively, the
"LLCs"). The Operating Partnership is a 99% managing member of each LLC and a
QRS Corporation is a 1% member of each LLC.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         BASIS OF PRESENTATION

         The Mergers and acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16. The fair value of
the consideration given by the Company in the


                                     F-10


Mergers was used as the valuation basis for each of the combinations. The
accompanying consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include the
results of the Properties purchased through the Mergers from their respective
closing dates.

         Due to the Company's ability as general partner to control either
through ownership or by contract the Operating Partnership, a series of
management limited partnerships and companies (collectively, the "Management
Partnerships" or the "Management Companies"), the Financing Partnerships, the
LLC's, and certain other entities, each such entity has been consolidated with
the Company for financial reporting purposes. In regard to the Management
Companies, the Company does not have legal control; however, these entities are
consolidated for financial reporting purposes, the effects of which are
immaterial.

      REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND DEPRECIATION

         Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation less an
adjustment, if any, for impairment. A land value is assigned based on the
purchase price if acquired separately or based on market research if acquired in
a merger or in a single or portfolio acquisition.

         For real estate properties to be disposed of, an impairment loss is
recognized when the fair value of the real estate, less the estimated cost to
sell, is less than the carrying amount of the real estate measured at the time
it is certain that the Company will sell the property. Real estate held for
disposition is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated
fair value, less its cost to sell.

         Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. The Company uses a 30-year estimated life for
buildings and a five-year estimated life for initial furniture, fixtures and
equipment. Replacements inside a unit such as appliances and carpeting, are
depreciated over a five-year estimated life. Expenditures for ordinary
maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant
renovations and improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the
asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally five to ten
years. Initial direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense
approximates the deferral and amortization of initial direct leasing costs over
the lease terms. Property sales or dispositions are recorded when title
transfers and sufficient consideration has been received by the Company. Upon
disposition, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
respective accounts. Any gain or loss on sale of disposition is recognized in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

         The Company classifies Properties under development and/or expansion
and properties in the lease up phase as construction in progress until
construction has been completed and all certificates of occupancy permits have
been obtained. The Company also classifies land relating to construction in
progress as land on its balance sheet.

      CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         The Company considers all demand deposits, money market accounts and
investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with
a maturity of three months or less, at the date of purchase, to be cash
equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial
institutions. The combined account balances at each institution periodically
exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance coverage,
and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on
deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. The Company believes that the risk
is not significant, as the Company does not anticipate their non-performance.


                                     F-11


      DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS

         Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain the
Company's lines of credit, long-term financings and costs for certain interest
rate protection agreements. These costs are amortized over the terms of the
related debt. Unamortized financing costs are written-off when debt is retired
before the maturity date. The accumulated amortization of such deferred
financing costs was $17.7 million and $11.1 million at December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

      RENTAL FURNITURE

         Rental furniture is stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line
basis at a rate of 1% per month, which is designed to approximate an estimated
useful life of four years with provision for a 50% residual value.

      PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

         Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation expense is
provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of three to ten
years.

      GOODWILL

         Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 20
years. The Company periodically reviews goodwill for impairment and if a
permanent decline in value has occurred, the Company would reduce its goodwill
balance to fair value. Accumulated amortization of goodwill was $1.8 million at
December 31, 2000.

      DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

         The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS")
No. 133/138, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, on
January 1, 2001. This new accounting standard requires companies to carry all
derivative instruments, including certain embedded derivatives, in the statement
of financial condition at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair
value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and
qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, on the reason for
holding it. The Company uses only qualifying hedges that are designated
specifically to reduce exposure to interest rate risk by locking in the expected
future cash payments on certain liabilities. This is typically accomplished
using an interest rate swap or treasury lock collar. For financial reporting
purposes, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the interest rate hedge
is recorded as a component of equity, which becomes reclassified into earnings
along with payments on the hedged liability.

         Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133/138 in January 2001, the Company
recorded a net transition adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive
income and either an unrealized gain or loss on hedges at that time which did
not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and results
of operations. Adoption of the standard resulted in the Company recognizing a
derivative instrument liability. In general, the amount of volatility will
vary with the level of derivative activities during any period.

      FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

         The fair values of the Company's financial instruments (excluding the
Company's investment in


                                     F-12


mortgage notes - see Note 8), including cash and cash equivalents, mortgage
notes payable, other notes payable, lines of credit and other financial
instruments, approximate their carrying or contract values.

      REVENUE RECOGNITION

         Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from tenants
and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different
than on a straight-line basis. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.
Leases entered into between a tenant and a Property for the rental of an
apartment unit are year-to-year, renewable upon consent of both parties on a
year-to-year or month-to-month basis.

         Leases of furniture generally have an initial term of three to six
months in duration and can be extended by the customer on a month-to-month
basis. Furniture rentals are accounted for as operating leases, and revenue is
recorded in the month earned. For sales of furniture, as well as rental buyouts,
revenue and related cost of sales are recorded when the furniture is delivered
or taken off lease. Revenues from both furniture rentals and sales are included
in furniture income while the associated costs of those rentals and sales are
included in furniture operating expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations.

      INCOME TAXES

         Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT and the nature of the
operations of the Properties and management business, the results of operations
contain no provision for federal income taxes. The Company is subject to certain
state and local income, excise and franchise taxes. The aggregate cost of land
and depreciable property for federal income tax purposes as of December 31, 2000
and 1999 was approximately $9.2 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively.

      MINORITY INTERESTS

         Operating Partnership: Net income is allocated to minority interests
based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. The
ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the number of Operating
Partnership Units ("OP Units") held by the minority interests by the total OP
Units held by the minority interests and the Company. Issuance of additional
Common Shares and OP Units changes the ownership interests of both the minority
interests and the Company. Such transactions and the proceeds therefrom are
treated as capital transactions.

          Partially Owned Properties: The Company reflects minority interests in
partially owned properties on the balance sheet for the portion of properties
consolidated by the Company that are not wholly owned by the Company. The
earnings or losses from those properties attributable to the minority interests
are reflected as minority interests in partially owned properties in the
consolidated statements of operations.

      USE OF ESTIMATES

         In preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management makes
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.

      RECLASSIFICATIONS

         Certain reclassifications have been made to the previously reported
financial statements in order to


                                     F-13


provide comparability with the 2000 statements reported herein. These
reclassifications have not changed the results of operations or shareholders'
equity.

      REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

         The Company has one primary reportable business segment, which consists
of investment in rental real estate. The Company's primary business is owning,
managing and operating multifamily residential properties which includes the
generation of rental and other related income through the leasing of apartment
units to tenants. The Company also has a segment for corporate level activity
including such items as fee and asset management income, furniture rental/sales
activity, interest income earned on short-term investments and investment in
mortgage notes, income or loss from investments in unconsolidated entities,
general and administrative expenses, and interest expense on mortgage notes
payable, unsecured note issuances, and lines of credit. The Company's fee and
asset management and furniture rental/sales activities are immaterial and do not
meet the threshold requirements of reportable segments as provided for in
Statement No. 131.

         The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources primarily
based on the rental, furniture and other income generated from each property
less property and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes and insurance,
property management expenses, fee and asset management expenses, and furniture
expenses, which is considered net operating income ("NOI"). However, all other
segment measurements are disclosed in the Company's consolidated financial
statements, and accordingly the accounting policies of the reportable segments
are the same as those described elsewhere in the Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies.

         The Company also considers funds from operations ("FFO") to be a
primary measure of the performance of real estate companies including an equity
REIT. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of the
performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flows from operating
activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors
an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to
make capital expenditures. FFO in and of itself does not represent cash
generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and therefore should not be
considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's
performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP
as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to
fund cash needs. The Company's calculation of FFO represents net income
available to Common Shares, excluding gains or losses on dispositions of
properties, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, and write-off of
unamortized costs on refinanced debt, plus depreciation on real estate assets
and income allocated to Minority Interests. The Company's calculation of FFO may
differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REIT's and,
accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REIT's. The Company adopted,
effective January 1, 2000, the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trust's ("NAREIT") updated recommended definition of FFO as approved in the
fourth quarter of 1999.

         All revenues are from external customers and no revenues are generated
from transactions with other segments. There are no tenants who contributed 10%
or more of the Company's total revenues during 2000, 1999 or 1998. Interest
expense on debt is not allocated to individual Properties, even if the
Properties secure such debt. Further, minority interest in consolidated
subsidiaries is not allocated to the Properties.

3.   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

         On October 1, 1999, the Company acquired Lexford, which included 402
Properties containing


                                     F-14


36,609 units and other related assets for a total purchase price of
approximately $738 million. In connection with the LFT Merger, each
outstanding common share of beneficial interest of LFT was converted into
0.463 of a Common Share of the Company. The purchase price consisted of 4.0
million Common Shares issued by the Company with a market value of $181.1
million, the assumption of mortgage indebtedness, a term loan and a line of
credit in the amount of $528.3 million, the acquisition of other assets of
approximately $40.9 million, the assumption of other liabilities of
approximately $25.3 million and other merger related costs of approximately
$24.5 million.

         On July 11, 2000, the Company acquired Globe in an all cash and debt
transaction valued at $163.2 million. Globe provides fully furnished
short-term housing through an inventory of leased housing units to
transferring or temporarily assigned corporate personnel, new hires,
trainees, consultants and individual customers throughout the United States.
Additionally, Globe rents and sells furniture to a diversified base of
commercial and residential customers throughout the United States.
Shareholders of Globe received $13.00 per share, which approximated $58.7
million in cash based on the 4.5 million Globe shares outstanding. In
addition, the Company:

     - Acquired $94.8 million in other Globe assets and assumed $29.6 million in
       other Globe liabilities;
     - Allocated $68.4 million to goodwill;
     - Recorded acquisition costs of $4.5 million; and
     - Assumed $70.4 million in debt, which included $1.4 million in mortgage
       debt, $39.5 million in unsecured notes, and Globe's line of credit
       totaling $29.5 million;

         On July 21, 2000, the Company, through its Globe subsidiary, acquired
TQ, the leading corporate housing provider in Atlanta, Georgia, in a $3.3
million all cash transaction.

         On October 31, 2000, the Company acquired Grove, which included 60
properties containing 7,308 units for a total purchase price of $463.2
million. The Company:

     - Paid $17.00 per share or $141.6 million in cash to purchase the 8.3
       million outstanding common shares of Grove.
     - Paid $17.00 per unit or $12.4 million in cash to purchase 0.7 million
       in Grove OP Units outstanding at the merger date.
     - Converted 2.1 million Grove OP Units to 0.8 million of the Operating
       Partnership's OP Units using the conversion ratio of 0.3696 (after
       cash-out of fractional units). The value of these converted OP Units
       totaled $37.2 million.
     - Assumed $241.3 million in Grove debt, which included first and second
       mortgages totaling $203.4 million and Grove's line of credit totaling
       $38.0 million.
     - Acquired $20.1 million in other Grove assets and assumed $11.2 million
       in other Grove liabilities, including an earnout note payable liability
       totaling $1.5 million. This amount represents the estimated additional
       cash or OP Units required to be funded to the previous owners of Glen
       Meadow Apartments upon the transition of this property from subsidized
       to market rents.
     - Recorded acquisition costs of $19.5 million.

         All of the amounts stated above related to the Mergers and acquisitions
are based on management's current best estimates, which are subject to
adjustment within one year of the respective closing dates.

4.   SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND MINORITY INTERESTS

         The following table presents the changes in the Company's issued and
outstanding Common Shares for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998:



         On February 3, 1998, the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3
Registration Statement to register $1 billion of equity securities. The SEC
declared this registration statement effective on February 27, 1998. In
addition, the Company carried over $272 million related to the registration
statement effective on August 4, 1997. As of December 31, 2000, $1.1 billion
remained available for issuance under this registration statement.

         The equity positions of various individuals and entities that
contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a
partnership interest are collectively referred to as the "Minority Interests -
Operating Partnership". As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Minority Interests
- - Operating Partnership held 12,428,751 and 12,483,742 OP Units, respectively.
As a result, the Minority Interests had an 8.57% and 8.92% interest in the
Operating Partnership at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Assuming
conversion of all OP Units into Common Shares, total Common Shares outstanding
at December 31, 2000 and 1999 would have been 145,045,126 and 139,934,540,
respectively.

                  Net proceeds from the Company's Common Share and Preferred
Share Offerings are contributed by the Company to the Operating Partnership in
return for an increased ownership percentage and are treated as capital
transactions in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result,
the net Offering Proceeds from Common Shares are allocated between shareholders'
equity and Minority Interests - Operating Partnership to account for the change
in their respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the
Operating Partnership.

         Effective January 1, 2000, the Company has included 100% of the
Guilford portfolio properties in


                                 F-16


the consolidated financial statements with the equity interests of the
unaffiliated partners reflected as Minority Interests -Partially Owned
Properties as a result of the Company acquiring additional interests.

         During 2000 and 1999, the Company, through a subsidiary of the
Operating Partnership, issued the following with an equity value of $186
million receiving net proceeds of $181.4 million:

7.        COMMITMENTS TO ACQUIRE/DISPOSE OF REAL ESTATE

         As of December 31, 2000, in addition to the Properties that were
subsequently acquired as discussed in Note 22, the Company entered into separate
agreements to acquire two multifamily properties containing 519 units. The

separate agreements to dispose of twenty-three multifamily properties containing
3,924 units to unaffiliated parties. The Company expects a combined disposition
price of approximately $210.5 million.

         The closings of these pending transactions are subject to certain
contingencies and conditions, therefore, there can be no assurance that these
transactions will be consummated or that the final terms thereof will not differ
in material respects from those summarized in the preceding paragraphs.

8.       INVESTMENT IN MORTGAGE NOTES, NET

         In 1995, the Company invested $89 million in various partnership
interests and subordinated mortgages collateralized by 21 Properties consisting
of 3,896 units. The unamortized balance of the discount on the notes at December
31, 2000 and 1999 was $3.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively. During 2000
and 1999, the Company amortized $1.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
This discount is being amortized utilizing the effective yield method based on
the expected life of the investment. The fair value as of December 31, 2000 and
1999 was estimated to be approximately $80.8 million and $87.0 million,
respectively, compared to the Company's carrying value of $77.2 million and
$85.0 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of the Company's
investment in mortgage notes represents the estimated net present value based on
the expected future property level cash flows and an estimated current market
discount rate.

9.       INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

         The Company has entered into two separate joint venture agreements with
third party development companies whereby the Company contributes 25% of the
development cost to the joint venture in return for preferential returns of 9.0%
per annum. The basis of the Company's equity investments in these two joint
ventures was $235.9 million and $125.5 million as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

         The Company also has various other investments in unconsolidated
entities with ownership interests ranging from 1.5% to 50.0%. The basis of these
equity investments was $80.6 million and $14.8 million as of December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively.


                                      F-23




         These investments are accounted for utilizing the equity method of
accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the net equity investment of
the Company is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated
statements of operations include the Company's share of net income or loss from
the unconsolidated entity.

         its lender position to a third party, thus receiving additional net
         cash proceeds of approximately $2.6 million. The bond indebtedness on

         at December 31, 1999;
     -   refinanced the debt on one existing property and consequently sold

         estate disposition.

         As of December 31, 1999, scheduled maturities for the Company's
outstanding mortgage indebtedness are at various dates through October 1, 2033.
The interest rate range on the Company's

                                      F-25




mortgage debt was 4.00% to 10.13% at December 31, 1999. During the year ended
December 31, 1999, the weighted average interest rate on the Company's
mortgage debt was 7.05%.

         Concurrent with the refinancing of certain tax-exempt bonds and as a
requirement of the credit provider of the bonds, the Financing Partnership,
which owns certain of the Properties, entered into interest rate protection
agreements, which were assigned to the credit provider as additional
security. The Financing Partnership pays interest based on a fixed interest
rate and the counterparty of the agreement pays interest to the Company at a
floating rate that is calculated based on the Public Securities Association
Index for municipal bonds ("PSA Municipal Index"). As of December 31, 2000,
the aggregate notional amounts of these agreements were approximately $131.6
million, $27.3 million and $8.9 million. As of December 31, 1999, the aggregate
notional amounts of these agreements were approximately $133.4 million, $27.7
million and $9.1 million. The fixed interest rates for these agreements were
4.81%, 4.528% and 4.90%. The termination dates are October 1, 2003, January
1, 2004 and April 1, 2004.

         The Company simultaneously entered into substantially identical
reverse interest rate protection agreements. Under these agreements the
Company pays interest monthly at a floating rate based on the PSA Municipal
Index and the counterparty pays interest to the Company based on a fixed
interest rate. As of December 31, 2000, the aggregate notional amounts of
these agreements were approximately $131.6 million, $27.3 million and $8.9
million. As of December 31, 1999, the aggregate notional amounts of these
agreements were approximately $133.4 million, $27.7 million and $9.1 million.
The fixed interest rates received by the Company in exchange for paying
interest based on the PSA Municipal Index for these agreements were 4.74%,
4.458% and 4.83%. The termination dates are October 1, 2003, January 1, 2004
and April 1, 2004. Collectively, these agreements effectively cost the
Company 0.07% per annum on the current outstanding aggregate notional amount.

         In May 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate protection
agreement to effectively fix the interest rate upon its refinancing of the Evans
Withycombe Financing Limited Partnership indebtedness to within a range of 5.6%
to 6.0%. The agreement was for a notional amount of $131 million with a
settlement date of August 2001.

         In August 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement that fixed the Company's interest rate risk on a portion of the
Operating Partnership's variable rate tax-exempt bond indebtedness at a rate of
3.65125%. This agreement was for a notional amount of $150 million with a
termination date of August 2003.

termination date of August 2003.

PUTABLE/CALLABLE IN 2005.

        As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the remaining unamortized balance of
deferred settlement receipts from treasury locks and interest rate protection
agreements was $8.8 million and $9.5 million, respectively.

deferred settlement payments on treasury locks and interest rate protection
agreements was $2.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively.

        In regard to the interest rate protection agreements mentioned, the
Company believes that it has limited exposure to the extent of non-performance
by the counterparties of each agreement since each counterparty is a major U.S.
financial institution, and the Company does not anticipate their
non-performance.

13.     LINES OF CREDIT

Option and Award Plan, officers and key employees of the Company may be awarded
Common Shares, subject to conditions and restrictions as described in the Fifth
Amended Option and Award Plan. Finally, certain executive officers of the
Company are subject to the Company's performance based restricted share grant
agreement. Options and SARs are sometimes referred to herein as "Awards".

         The Company has reserved 12,500,000 Common Shares for issuance under
the Fifth Amended Option and Award Plan. The Options generally are granted at
the fair market value of the Company's Common Shares at the date of grant, vest
over a three year period, are exercisable upon vesting and expire ten years from
the date of grant. The exercise price for all Options under the Fifth Amended
Option and Award Plan shall not be less than the fair market value of the
underlying Common Shares at the time the Option is granted. The Fifth Amended
Option and Award Plan will terminate at such time as no further Common Shares
are available for issuance upon the exercise of Options and all outstanding
Options have expired or been exercised. The Board of Trustees may at any time
amend or terminate the Fifth Amended Option and Award Plan, but termination will
not affect Awards previously granted. Any Options, which had vested prior to
such a termination, would remain exercisable by the holder thereof.

         As to the Options that have been granted through December 31, 2000,
generally, one-third are exercisable one year after the initial grant, one-third
are exercisable two years following the date such Options were granted and the
remaining one-third are exercisable three years following the date such Options
were granted.

         As to the restricted shares that have been awarded through
December 31, 2000, these shares generally vest three years from the award date.
During the three year period of restriction, the employee receives quarterly
dividend payments on their shares. If employment is terminated prior to the
lapsing of the restriction, the shares are canceled. During the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company issued 260,481 and 324,749 restricted
shares. The estimated remaining unearned compensation related to these
restricted shares, which includes performance based awards for certain
executive officers, as of December 31, 2000 was $14.9 million.

                                     F-32


         The Company has elected to apply the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES
("APB No. 25"), in the computation of compensation expense. Under APB No.
25's intrinsic value method, compensation expense is determined by computing
the excess of the market price of the shares over the exercise price on the
measurement date. For the Company's share options, the intrinsic value on the
measurement date (or grant date) is zero, and no compensation expense is
recognized. For the Company's restricted shares, the Company determines the
intrinsic value on the measurement date and accordingly recognizes a
compensation expense for such shares. FASB Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ("Statement No.
123"), requires the Company to disclose pro forma net income and income per
share as if a fair value based accounting method had been used in the
computation of compensation expense. The fair value of the options computed
under Statement No. 123 would be recognized over the vesting period of the
options. The fair value for the Company's options was estimated at the time
the options were granted using the Black Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted-average assumptions for 1998, 1999 and 2000,
respectively: risk-free interest rates of 5.37%, 5.84% and 6.22%; dividend
yields of 5.98%, 6.89% and 6.83%; volatility factors of the expected market
price of the Company's Common Shares of 0.212, 0.209 and 0.207; and a
weighted-average expected life of the options of seven years.

         The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company's Options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its Options.

         For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
Options is amortized to expense over the Options' vesting period. The following
is the pro forma information for the three years ended December 31, 2000, 1999
and 1998:



         The table below summarizes the Option activity of the Fifth Amended
Option and Award Plan and options assumed in connection with Mergers (the
"Merger Options") for the three years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998:


                                       F-33




         As of December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, 3,959,152 shares, 3,165,554
shares and 2,841,561 shares were exercisable, respectively. Exercise prices for
Options outstanding as of December 31, 2000 ranged from $26 to $54.8125 for the
Fifth Amended Option and Award Plan and $2.83 to $48.60 for the Merger Options.

17.      EMPLOYEE PLANS

         The Company has established an Employee Share Purchase Plan whereby
trustees and employees of the Company may annually acquire up to $100,000 of
Common Shares of the Company. The aggregate number of Common Shares available
under the Employee Share Purchase Plan shall not exceed 1,000,000, subject to
adjustment by the Board of Trustees. The Common Shares may be purchased
quarterly at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a
share on the last day of such quarter; and (b) the greater of: (i) the closing
price for a share on the first day of such quarter, and (ii) the average closing
price for a share for all the business days in the quarter. During 1998, the
Company issued 93,521 Common Shares at net prices that ranged from $35.70 per
share to $42.71 per share and raised approximately $3.7 million in connection
therewith. During 1999, the Company issued 147,885 Common Shares at net prices
that ranged from $34.37 per share to $36.71 per share and raised approximately
$5.2 million in connection therewith. During 2000, the Company issued 149,790
Common Shares at net prices that ranged from $34.11 per share to $41.01 per
share and raised approximately $5.4 million in connection therewith.

         The Company has established a defined contribution plan (the "401(k)
Plan") that provides retirement benefits for employees that meet minimum
employment criteria. The Company contributes 100% of the first 4% of eligible
compensation that a participant contributes to the 401(k) Plan. Participants are
vested in the Company's contributions over five years. The Company made
contributions in the amount


                                       F-34


of $1.4 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 1998 and
1999, respectively, and expects to make contributions in the amount of
approximately $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.

18.      DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT AND SHARE PURCHASE PLAN

         On November 3, 1997, the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3
Registration Statement to register 7,000,000 Common Shares pursuant to a
Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (the "DRIP Plan"). The
registration statement was declared effective on November 25, 1997.

         The DRIP Plan of the Company provides holders of record and beneficial
owners of Common Shares, Preferred Shares, and limited partnership interests in
the Operating Partnership with a simple and convenient method of investing cash
distributions in additional Common Shares (which is referred to herein as the
"Dividend Reinvestment - DRIP Plan"). Common Shares may also be purchased on a
monthly basis with optional cash payments made by participants in the DRIP Plan
and interested new investors, not currently shareholders of the Company, at the
market price of the Common Shares less a discount ranging between 0% and 5%, as
determined in accordance with the DRIP Plan (which is referred to herein as the
"Share Purchase - DRIP Plan").

19.      TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

     Certain officers of the Company purchased Common Shares which were financed
with loans made by the Company at various rates ranging from 6.15% to 7.93% per
annum and at one month LIBOR plus 2.0% per annum. Scheduled maturities are at
various dates through 2005. The amounts outstanding at December 31, 2000 and
1999 are $4.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively.

         The Company also entered into deferred compensation and share
distribution agreements with certain officers of the Company that resulted in
the Company recognizing compensation expense of $0.9 million, $1.1 million and
$0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

         In connection with certain Mergers, the Company agreed to make
consulting payments to certain individuals who had been employees of the
companies acquired and who became trustees of the Company subsequent to the
applicable merger dates. During the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, the Company made payments pursuant to these agreements of $400,000,
$625,000 and $625,000, respectively. The remaining future payments to be made
under these agreements as of December 31, 2000 are approximately $567,000.

         The Company occupies space at various office buildings that are
owned and/or managed by Equity Office Holdings, L.L.C. ("EOH"), a company
of which EQR's chairman of the board is also chairman of the board. Amounts
incurred for such office space for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999
and 1998 were $1,781,069, $1,466,569 and $1,067,970, respectively.

         Artery Property Management, Inc., a real estate property management
company ("APMI") in which a trustee of the Company is a two-thirds owner and
chairman of the board of directors, provided the Company consulting services
with regard to property acquisitions and additional business opportunities.
In connection with the acquisition of certain Properties from this trustee
and his affiliates during 1995, the Company made a loan to this trustee and
APMI of $15,212,000 evidenced by two notes and secured by 465,545 OP Units.
At December 31, 2000, no amounts were outstanding under these notes and all
OP Units were released from their pledges.

                                       F-35


         During 1999, the Company acquired eight Properties and the related
management agreements from affiliates of the aforementioned trustee for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $110.2 million, including the
assumption of approximately $44.3 million of mortgage indebtedness. The
purchase price also included the issuance of 28,795 Series A Junior
Convertible Preference Units in the Operating Partnership which have a
liquidation value of $100 per unit and are exchangeable for OP Units under
certain circumstances. On June 29, 1999, this trustee received 8,462 of these
units with a liquidation value of approximately $0.8 million.

         The Company paid legal fees to a law firm of which one of the Company's
trustees is a partner, in the amounts of $3.6 million, $1.6 million and $2.2
million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

         In addition, the Company has provided acquisitions, asset and property
management services to certain related entities for properties not owned by the
Company. Fees received for providing such services were approximately $1.7
million, $2.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.

20.      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

         The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various
environmental laws of Federal and local governments. Compliance by the Company
with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial condition and results of operations. However, the Company cannot
predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on its current
Properties or on properties that it may acquire in the future.

         The Company does not believe there is any litigation threatened against
the Company other than routine litigation arising out of the ordinary course of
business, some of which is expected to be covered by liability insurance, none
of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial statements of the Company.

         In regards to the funding of Properties in the development and/or
earnout stage and the joint venture agreements with two multifamily residential
real estate developers, the Company funded a total of $160.9 million during the
year ended December 31, 2000. The Company expects to fund approximately $83.2
million in connection with these Properties beyond 2000. In connection with one
joint venture agreement, the Company has an obligation to fund up to an
additional $17.5 million to guarantee third party construction financing. At any
time following the completion of construction of any development property, the
Company's joint venture partners have the right to cause the Company to acquire
said partner's interest in the completed project on certain terms and conditions
contained in their partnership agreement at a mutually agreeable price.

         In connection with the Wellsford Merger, the Company provided a credit
enhancement with respect to certain tax-exempt bonds issued to finance certain
public improvements at a multifamily development project. As of December 31,
2000, this enhancement was still in effect at a commitment amount of $12.7
million.

         During the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, total lease
payments incurred, including a portion of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs
and utilities, aggregated $4,074,672, $3,271,513 and $2,528,150 respectively.


                                       F-36


         The minimum basic aggregate rental commitment under the Company's
leases in years following December 31, 2000 is as follows:

21.      REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

         The following tables set forth the reconciliation of net income and
total assets for the Company's reportable segments for the years ended December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.




                                     F-38






                                     F-39





(1)  The Company's primary business is owning, managing, and operating
     multifamily residential properties which includes the generation of rental
     and other related income through the leasing of apartment units to tenants.

(2)  The Company has a segment for corporate level activity including such items
     as fee and asset management activity, furniture rental/sales activity,
     interest income earned on short-term investments and investment in mortgage
     notes, investment in technology entities, income earned from investments in
     unconsolidated entities, general and administrative expenses, and interest
     expense on mortgage notes payable, unsecured note issuances and lines of
     credit. The Company's fee and asset management and furniture rental/sales
     activities are immaterial and do not meet the threshold requirements of a
     reportable segment as provided for in Statement No. 131. Interest expense
     on debt is not allocated to individual Properties, even if the Properties
     secure such debt. Further, income allocated to Minority Interests is not
     allocated to the Properties.
