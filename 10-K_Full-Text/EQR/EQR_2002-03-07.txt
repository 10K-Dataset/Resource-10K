Item 1. Business

General

Equity Residential Properties Trust ("EQR") is a self-administered and self-managed equity real estate investment trust ("REIT"). EQR was
organized in March 1993 and commenced operations on August 18, 1993 upon completion of its initial public offering (the "EQR IPO") of 26,450,000 common shares of beneficial interest,
$0.01 par value per share ("Common Shares"). EQR was formed to continue the multifamily property business objectives and acquisition strategies of certain affiliated entities controlled by
Mr. Samuel Zell, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of EQR. These entities had been engaged in the acquisition, ownership and operation of multifamily residential properties since 1969. As used
herein, the term "Company" includes EQR and those entities owned or controlled by it, as the survivor of the mergers between EQR and each of Wellsford Residential Property Trust, Evans Withycombe
Residential, Inc., Merry Land & Investment Company, Inc. and Lexford Residential Trust (collectively, the "Mergers"). The term "Company" also includes Globe Business
Resources, Inc. ("Globe") and Grove Property Trust ("Grove"). The Company completed the sale of its Globe furniture rental business on January 11, 2002. The Company has elected to be
taxed as a REIT under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Certain capitalized terms are defined in the Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements.

EQR
is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2001, owned an approximate 92.1% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership"). The
Company conducts substantially all of its business and owns substantially all of its assets through the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership is, in turn, directly or indirectly, a partner,
member or shareholder of numerous partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations which have been established primarily to own fee simple title to multifamily properties or to conduct
property management activities and other businesses related to the ownership and operation of multifamily residential real estate. References to the "Company" include the Operating Partnership and
each of the
partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations controlled by the Operating Partnership or EQR.

The
Company is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, management, operation and disposition of multifamily properties. As of December 31, 2001, the Company owned or had interests
in a portfolio of 1,076 multifamily properties (individually a "Property" and collectively the "Properties") containing 224,801 apartment units consisting of the following:

Number of

Properties

Number of

Units

Wholly Owned Properties


199,698

Partially Owned Properties


6,931

Unconsolidated Properties


18,172

Total Properties

1,076

224,801

The
Company accounts for its ownership interest in the 955 "Wholly Owned Properties" under the consolidation method of accounting. The Company beneficially owns 100% fee simple title to
948 of the 955 Wholly Owned Properties. The Company has a leasehold estate ownership interest in one Property. As such, the Company owns the real estate building and improvements and leases the land
underlying the improvements under a long-term ground lease that expires in 2066. This one Property is consolidated and reflected as a real estate asset while the ground lease is accounted
for as an operating lease in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 13,

Accounting for Leases.

The Company owns
the debt collateralized by two Properties and owns an interest in the debt


collateralized by the remaining four Properties. The Company consolidates its interest in these six Properties in accordance with the accounting standards outlined in the AcSEC guidance for real
estate acquisition, development and construction arrangements issued in the CPA letter dated February 10, 1986, and as such, reflects these assets as real estate in the consolidated financial
statements.

The
"Partially Owned Properties" are controlled and partially owned by the Company but have partners with minority interests and are accounted for under the consolidation method of
accounting. The "Unconsolidated Properties" are partially owned but not controlled by the Company and consist of investments in partnership interests and/or subordinated mortgages that are accounted
for under the equity method of accounting. The above table does not include various uncompleted development properties.

The
Company is one of the largest publicly traded REIT's (based on the aggregate market value of its outstanding Common Shares) and is the largest publicly traded REIT owner of
multifamily properties (based on the number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned). The Company's Properties are located in 36 states with its corporate headquarters located
in Chicago, Illinois. The Company also leases (under operating leases) over thirty-five divisional, regional and area property management offices throughout the United States.

Direct
fee simple title for certain of the Properties is owned by single-purpose nominee corporations, limited partnerships and limited liability companies or land trusts that engage in
no business other than holding title to the Property for the benefit of the Company. Holding title in such a manner is expected to make it less costly to transfer such Property in the future in the
event of a sale and should facilitate financing, since lenders often require title to a Property to be held in a single purpose entity in order to isolate that Property from potential liabilities of
other Properties.

The
Company has approximately 6,400 employees as of March 1, 2002. An on-site manager, who supervises the on-site employees and is responsible for the
day-to-day operations of the Property, directs each of the Company's Properties. An assistant manager and/or leasing staff generally assist the manager. In addition, a
maintenance director at each Property supervises a maintenance staff whose responsibilities include a variety of tasks, including responding to service requests, preparing vacant apartments for the
next resident and performing preventive maintenance procedures year-round.

Business Objectives and Operating Strategies

The Company seeks to maximize both current income and long-term growth in income, thereby increasing:

•

the
value of the Properties;

•

distributions
on a per Common Share basis; and

•

shareholders'
value.

The
Company's strategies for accomplishing these objectives are:

•

maintaining
and increasing Property occupancy while increasing rental rates;

•

controlling
expenses, providing regular preventive maintenance, making periodic renovations and enhancing amenities;

•

maintaining
a ratio of consolidated debt-to-total market capitalization of less than 50%;

•

strategically
acquiring and disposing of properties;

•

purchasing
newly developed, as well as co-investing in the development of, multifamily communities;


•

entering
into joint ventures related to the ownership of established properties; and

•

strategically
investing in various businesses that will enhance services for the Properties.

The
Company is committed to resident satisfaction by striving to anticipate industry trends and implementing strategies and policies consistent with providing quality resident services.
In addition, the Company continuously surveys rental rates of competing properties and conducts resident satisfaction surveys to determine the factors they consider most important in choosing a
particular apartment unit and/or Property.

Acquisition and Development Strategies

The Company anticipates that future property acquisitions and developments will occur within the continental United States. Management will continue to use market
information to evaluate opportunities. The Company's market database allows it to review the primary economic indicators of the markets where the Company currently owns and manages Properties and
where it expects to expand its operations. Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity
securities, sales of Properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings. In addition, the Company may acquire additional properties in transactions that include
the issuance of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership ("OP Units") as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the
sellers to defer, in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain, which might otherwise result from the sales.

When
evaluating potential acquisitions and developments, the Company will consider:

•

the
geographic area and type of community;

•

the
location, construction quality, condition and design of the property;

•

the
current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow;

•

the
potential for capital appreciation of the property;

•

the
terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases;

•

income
levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market;

•

household
growth and net migration of the relevant market's population;

•

the
potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located;

•

the
occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity (the overall market and submarket);

•

the
prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property;

•

the
benefits of integration into existing operations;

•

barriers
to entry that would limit competition (zoning laws, building permit availability, supply of undeveloped or developable real estate, local building
costs and construction labor costs among other factors);

•

purchase
prices and yields of available existing stabilized communities, if any; and

•

competition
from existing multifamily properties and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area.


Financing Strategies

On October 11, 2001, the Company effected a two-for-one split of its Common Shares and OP Units to shareholders and unit holders of
record as of September 21, 2001. All Common Shares and OP Units presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Common Share and OP Unit split.

The
Company's "Consolidated Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization Ratio" as of December 31, 2001 is presented in the following table. The Company calculates
the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum of (i) the total outstanding Common Shares and assumed conversion of all OP Units at the equivalent market value of the closing
price of the Company's Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) the "Common Share Equivalent" of all convertible preferred shares and preference interests/units; and (iii) the
liquidation value of all perpetual preferred shares and preference interests outstanding.

The
Company's policy is to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt-to-total market capitalization of less than 50%.

It
is also the Company's policy that all unsecured indebtedness (other than short-term trade, employee compensation or similar indebtedness that will be paid in the ordinary
course of business) be


incurred by the Operating Partnership to the extent necessary to fund the business activities conducted by the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.

During
1999:

•

The
Operating Partnership issued $300 million of redeemable unsecured fixed rate notes (the "June 2004 Notes") in a public debt offering in

February 27, 1998. As of December 31, 2001, $1.13 billion in debt securities remained available for issuance under this registration statement.

Disposition Strategies

Management will use market information to evaluate dispositions. Factors the Company considers in deciding whether to dispose of its Properties include the
following:

•

potential
increases in new construction;

•

areas
where the economy is expected to decline substantially; and

•

markets
where the Company does not intend to establish long-term concentrations.

The
Company will reinvest the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to fund property acquisitions as well as fund development activities. In addition, when feasible, the
Company may structure these transactions as tax deferred exchanges.


Credit Facilities

The Company has a revolving credit facility to provide the Operating Partnership with potential borrowings of up to $700 million. This line of credit is
scheduled to expire in August 2002 and the Company has begun negotiations to have a new line of credit in place by the end of the second quarter of 2002. As of February 28, 2002,
$262.0 million was outstanding under this facility at a weighted average interest rate of 2.38%.

In
connection with its acquisition of Globe, the Company assumed a revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to $55.0 million. On May 31, 2001, this credit
facility was terminated.

Business Combinations

On October 1, 1999, the Company completed the acquisition of the multifamily property business of Lexford Residential Trust ("LFT") through the LFT Merger.
The transaction was valued at
approximately $738 million and included 402 LFT Properties containing 36,609 units. The purchase price consisted of:

•

8.0 million
Common Shares issued by the Company (each outstanding common share of beneficial interest of LFT was converted into 0.926 of a Common
Share) with a market value of approximately $181.1 million;

•

assumption
of mortgage indebtedness and unsecured notes in the amount of $528.3 million;

•

acquisition
of other assets of approximately $40.9 million and assumption of other liabilities of approximately $25.3 million; and

•

other
merger related costs of approximately $24.5 million.

On
July 11, 2000, the Company acquired Globe in an all cash and debt transaction valued at approximately $163.2 million. Globe provided fully furnished
short-term housing through an inventory of leased housing units to transferring or temporarily assigned corporate personnel, new hires, trainees, consultants and individual customers
throughout the United States. Additionally, Globe rents and sells furniture to a diversified base of commercial and residential customers throughout the United States. Shareholders of Globe received
$13.00 per share, which approximated $58.7 million in cash based on the 4.5 million Globe shares outstanding. In addition, the Company:

•

Acquired
$94.8 million in other Globe assets and assumed $29.6 million in other Globe liabilities;

•

Allocated
$68.4 million to goodwill;

•

Recorded
acquisition costs of $4.5 million; and

July 21, 2000, the Company, through its Globe subsidiary, acquired Temporary Quarters, Inc., the leading corporate housing provider in Atlanta, Georgia, in a
$3.3 million all cash transaction.

As
of September 30, 2001, the Company recorded $60.0 million of asset impairment charges related to its furniture rental business. These charges were the result of a review
of the existing intangible and tangible assets reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2001. The impairment loss is reflected on the income statement in total expenses
and includes the write-down of the following assets: a) goodwill of approximately $26.0 million; b) rental furniture, net of approximately $28.6 million;
c) property and equipment, net of approximately $4.5 million; and d) other assets of approximately $0.9 million.


On
January 11, 2002, the Company sold the former Globe furniture rental business for approximately $30.0 million in cash, which approximated the net book value at the sale
date. The Company has retained ownership of the former Globe short-term furnished housing business, which is now known as Equity Corporate Housing.

On
October 31, 2000 the Company acquired Grove, which included 60 properties containing 7,308 units for a total purchase price of $463.2 million. The Company:

•

Paid
$17.00 per share or $141.6 million in cash to purchase the 8.3 million outstanding common shares of Grove;

•

Paid
$17.00 per unit or $12.4 million in cash to purchase 0.7 million Grove OP Units outstanding at the merger date;

•

Converted
2.1 million Grove OP Units to 1.6 of the Operating Partnership's OP units using the conversion ratio of 0.7392 (after cash-out
of fractional units). The value of these converted OP units totaled $37.2 million;

•

Assumed
$241.3 million in Grove debt, which included first and second mortgages totaling $203.4 million and Grove's line of credit totaling
$38.0 million. Grove's line of credit and two mortgage loans totaling $7.8 million were paid off immediately after the closing;

•

Acquired
$20.1 million in other Grove assets and assumed $11.2 million in other Grove liabilities, including a contingent earnout liability
totaling $1.5 million. This amount represents the estimated additional cash or OP Units required to be funded to the previous owners of Glen Meadow Apartments upon the transition of this
property from subsidized to market rents; and

•

Recorded
acquisition costs of $19.5 million.

The
Company accounted for these business combinations as purchases in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 16. The fair value of the consideration given
by the Company was used as the valuation basis for each of the combinations.

Competition

All of the Properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties. The number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular
area could have a material effect on the Company's ability to lease units at the Properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged. The Company may be competing with other
entities that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have more experience than the Company's managers. In addition, other forms of rental properties, including multifamily
properties and manufactured housing, some of which may be controlled by Mr. Zell, and single-family housing, provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties.

Risk Factors

The following Risk Factors may contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other sections of this report. Unless
otherwise indicated, when used in this section, the terms "we" and "us" refer to Equity Residential Properties Trust and its subsidiaries, including ERP Operating Limited
Partnership.

Set
forth below are the risks that we believe are important to investors who purchase or own our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest (which we
refer to collectively as "Shares"); preference interests ("Interests") of a subsidiary of ERP Operating Limited Partnership; preference units ("Units"); or units of limited partnership interest ("OP
Units") of ERP Operating Limited Partnership, our operating partnership, which are redeemable on a one-for-one basis for common shares or their cash equivalent. In this
section, we refer to the Shares, Interests, Units and


the OP Units together as our "securities," and the investors who own Shares, Interests, Units and/or OP Units as our "security holders."

Debt Financing, Preferred Shares and Preference Interests and Units Could Adversely Affect Our Performance

with a weighted average dividend preference of 8.06% per annum. Our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks, including the following.

Scheduled Debt Payments Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition

In the future, our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected
levels.

We
may not be able to refinance existing debt (which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity) and, if we can, the terms of such refinancing might not
be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions, such as new equity
capital, our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt. As a result, we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties
and may have to dispose of one or


more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us. The Company's debt maturity schedule as of December 31, 2001 is as follows:

Financial Covenants Could Adversely Affect the Company's Financial Condition

If a property we own is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments, the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on
the property, resulting in loss of income and asset value. Foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial
condition and results of operations. A foreclosure could also result in our recognition of taxable income without our actually receiving cash proceeds from the disposition of the property with which
to pay the tax. This could adversely affect our cash flow and could make it more difficult for us to meet our distribution requirements as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT").

The
mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that, among other things, limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the
property and to reduce or change insurance coverage. In addition, our credit facilities contain certain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness.
Our current $700 million revolving credit facility matures in August 2002 and we will negotiate new covenants when we enter into the new credit facility which we expect will be no more
restrictive than those contained in our existing credit facility, although there can be no assurance that our expectations will prove to be accurate. The indentures under which a substantial portion
of our debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including, among other things, maintenance of certain financial ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur
secured and unsecured indebtedness (including acquisition financing), and to sell all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility and indentures are cross-defaulted and also contain cross
default provisions with other material indebtedness.

Some
of the properties were financed with tax-exempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions. We have retained an independent outside consultant
to monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties. If these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to
attract low or moderate-income tenants, or eligible/qualified tenants, then our income from these properties may be limited.

Our Degree of Leverage Could Limit Our Ability to Obtain Additional Financing

Our Consolidated Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization Ratio was approximately 37.20% as of December 31, 2001. We have a policy of
incurring indebtedness for borrowed money only through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries and only if upon such incurrence our debt to market capitalization ratio would be approximately
50% or less. Our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders. For example, the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes, making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally.

Rising Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow

Advances under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR available at various interest periods, plus a certain spread dependent upon
the Company's credit rating. Certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments also, from time to time, bear interest at floating rates. We may also borrow additional money with
variable interest rates in the future. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expenses under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness
and of issuing new debt. Accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders.


Control and Influence by Significant Shareholders Could be Exercised in a Manner Adverse to Other Shareholders

General

As of January 15, 2002, (1) Samuel Zell, the Chairman of the Board of the Company, and certain of the current holders of Units issued to affiliates
of Mr. Zell owned in the aggregate approximately 3.1% of our common shares (Mr. Zell and these affiliates are described herein as the "Zell Original Owners"); and (2) our
executive officers and trustees, excluding Mr. Zell (see disclosure above), owned approximately 5.7% of our common shares. These percentages assume all options are exercised for
common shares and all Units are converted to common shares. In addition, the consent of certain affiliates of Mr. Zell is required for certain amendments to the Fifth Amended and Restated ERP
Operating Limited Partnership Agreement of Limited Partnership (the "Partnership Agreement"). As a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the Partnership Agreement,
Mr. Zell may have substantial influence over the Company. Although these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter, they would be in a position to exercise even more
influence over the Company's affairs if they were to act together in the future. This influence might be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders.

Environmental Problems are Possible and can be Costly

Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to
investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property. The owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage
and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability
without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by
the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting
from environmental contamination emanating from that site.

Environmental
laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and
maintain the asbestos, that they notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be
disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third
parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.

Substantially
all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies. These environmental
assessments have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition or liquidity.

Recently
there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties other than the Company alleging personal injury and property damage caused
by the presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by
excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates. We have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our
properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property.


We
cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a
material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties.

Our Performance and Share Value are Subject to Risks Associated with the Real Estate Industry

General

Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and
value of our properties. These factors include changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand
for our multifamily properties, the attractiveness of our properties to tenants, competition from other available multifamily property owners and changes in market rental rates. Our performance also
depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants and to pay for adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, which could increase over time. Also, the
expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property.

We May be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Units as Leases Expire

When our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be able to relet their units. Even if the residents do renew or we can relet the
units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. Because virtually all of our leases are for apartments, they are generally for terms of no more than one year.
If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and
financial condition will be adversely affected. Consequently, our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders would be reduced.

New Acquisitions or Developments May Fail to Perform as Expected and Competition for Acquisitions May Result in Increased Prices for Properties

We intend to continue to actively acquire and develop multifamily properties. Newly acquired or developed properties may fail to perform as expected. We may
underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to develop a property. Additionally, we expect that other major real
estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts. This
competition may increase prices for multifamily properties. We may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms.

Because Real Estate Investments Are Illiquid, We May Not Be Able To Sell Properties When Appropriate

Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. This
inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders.

Changes in Laws Could Affect Our Business

We are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate taxes, income taxes and service or other taxes. Consequently, any
such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders. Similarly, changes


that increase our potential liability under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our
securities.

Shareholders' Ability to Effect Changes in Control of the Company is Limited

Provisions of Our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws Could Inhibit Changes in Control

Certain provisions of our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transactions that could provide the
security holders with a premium over the then-prevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders. These include a
staggered Board of Trustees and the 5% Ownership Limit described below. See "—We Have a Share Ownership Limit for REIT Tax Purposes." Also, any future series of preferred shares of
beneficial interest may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders.

We Have a Share Ownership Limit for REIT Tax Purposes

To remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding Shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five
or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year. To facilitate maintenance of our REIT qualification, our Declaration of Trust, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits ownership by
any single shareholder of more than 5% of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares. We refer to this restriction as the "Ownership Limit." Absent any
exemption or waiver granted by our Board of Trustees, securities acquired or held in violation of the Ownership Limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated
charitable beneficiary, and the security holder's rights to distributions and to vote would terminate. A transfer of Shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the Ownership Limit. The
Ownership Limit could delay or prevent a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our security holders' ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price
for their Shares.

Our Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest May Affect Changes in Control

Our Declaration of Trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares of beneficial interest, and to establish the
preferences and rights (including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares) of any preferred shares issued. The Board of Trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and
to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders. As of December 31, 2001,
11,344,521 preferred shares were issued and outstanding.

Inapplicability of Maryland Law Limiting Certain Changes in Control

Certain provisions of Maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit "business combinations" (including certain issuances of equity securities)
with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities, or with an affiliate who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date
in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust's outstanding voting securities (an "Interested Shareholder"), or with an affiliate of an Interested
Shareholder. These prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the Interested Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder. After the five-year period, a business
combination with an Interested Shareholder must be approved by two super-majority shareholder votes unless, among other conditions, holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares
and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the Interested Shareholder for its common shares. As permitted by Maryland law, however, the Board of Trustees of
the Company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination


involving the Zell Original Owners and persons acting in concert with any of the Zell Original Owners. Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements
will not apply to a business combination involving us and/or any of them. Such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders.

Our Success as a REIT is Dependent on Compliance With Federal Income Tax Requirements

Our Failure to Qualify as a REIT Would Have Serious Adverse Consequences to Our Security Holders

We believe that we have qualified for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended December 31, 1992 based, in part,
upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions. We plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many
of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. We cannot, therefore, guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a REIT. The determination that we are a REIT
requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from sources that are itemized
in the REIT tax laws. We are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income excluding capital gains. The fact that we hold our assets through ERP Operating
Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, Congress
and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a REIT. We do not
believe, however, that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our REIT status.

If
we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would
remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year we first failed to qualify. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would have to pay significant income taxes. We, therefore, would have
less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders. This would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities. In addition, we would no longer be
required to make any distributions to security holders.

We could be Disqualified as a REIT or Have to Pay Taxes if Our Merger Partners Did Not Qualify as REIT's

If any of our recent merger partners had failed to qualify as a REIT throughout the duration of their existence, then they might have had undistributed "C
corporation earnings and profits" at the time of their merger with us. If that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took
place, we might not qualify as a REIT. We believe based upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements, among other things, that each of our merger partners
qualified as a REIT and that, in any event, none of them had any undistributed "C corporation earnings and profits" at the time of their merger with us. If any of our merger partners failed to qualify
as a REIT, an additional concern would be that they would have recognized taxable gain at the time they were merged with us. We would be liable for the tax on such gain. In this event, we would have
to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger. Finally, we could be
precluded from electing REIT status for up to four years after the year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for REIT status.


Other Tax Liabilities

Even if we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. In addition, our third-party management
operations, which are conducted through subsidiaries, generally will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.

We Depend on Our Key Personnel

We depend on the efforts of the Chairman of our Board of Trustees, Samuel Zell, and our executive officers, particularly Douglas Crocker II and
Gerald A. Spector. If they resign, our operations could be temporarily adversely effected. Mr. Zell and Mr. Crocker have entered into executive compensation agreements and
retirement benefit agreements with the Company. Mr. Crocker and Mr. Spector have entered into Deferred Compensation Agreements with the Company that under certain conditions could
provide both with a salary benefit after their respective termination of employment with the Company. In addition, Mr. Zell, Mr. Crocker and Mr. Spector have entered into
Noncompetition Agreements with the Company. On August 23, 2001, the Company announced that it commenced an executive search for a new President as a part of its long-term succession
planning effort.

Compliance with REIT Distribution Requirements May Affect Our Financial Condition

Distribution Requirements May Increase the Indebtedness of the Company

We may be required from time to time, under certain circumstances, to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received. In such
event, or upon our repayment of principal on debt, we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a REIT. Accordingly, we could be required
to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements.

Federal Income Tax Considerations

General

The following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares. It is not exhaustive of all possible tax
considerations. For example, it does not give a detailed discussion of any state, local or foreign tax considerations. The following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be
relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances. Moreover, it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment
under the tax laws, such as insurance companies, tax-exempt entities,
financial institutions or broker-dealers, foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the United States.

The
specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase, ownership and disposition of common shares.
Therefore, it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder's personal tax
situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

The
information in this section is based on the current Internal Revenue Code, current, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations, the legislative history of the Internal Revenue Code,
current administrative interpretations and practices of the Internal Revenue Service, including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings, which are not binding on the Internal
Revenue Service, and existing court decisions. Future legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations
of current law. Any change could apply retroactively. Thus, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could challenge


the statements in this discussion, which do not bind the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and that a court could agree with the Internal Revenue Service.

Our Taxation

We elected REIT status beginning with the year that ended December 31, 1992. In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to
federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most
corporations, which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive.

We
will be subject, however, to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our REIT taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders. In addition, we
will be subject to a 4% excise tax if we do not satisfy specific REIT distribution requirements. We could also be subject to the "alternative minimum tax" on our items of tax preference. In addition,
any net income from "prohibited transactions" (i.e., dispositions of property, other than property held by a taxable REIT subsidiary, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of
business) will be subject to a 100% tax. We could also be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable REIT subsidiary if certain rules
enacted as part of the REIT Modernization Act of 1999 are not complied with. Moreover, we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently
contemplate.

We
believe that we have qualified as a REIT for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992. We also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will
continue to qualify as a REIT. However, given the complexity of the REIT qualification requirements, we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will
satisfy the requirements under the Internal Revenue Code for a particular year.

If
we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We also may be subject to the corporate
"alternate minimum tax." As a result, our failure to qualify as a REIT would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders. Unless entitled to statutory relief, we
would be disqualified from qualification as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to
statutory relief.

Tax
legislation has recently been enacted which is intended to allow REITs to have greater flexibility in engaging in activities which previously had been prohibited by the REIT rules.
Among these changes was the establishment of "taxable REIT subsidiaries" or "TRSs" which are corporations subject to tax as a regular "C" corporation. Generally, a taxable REIT subsidiary can own
assets that cannot be owned by a REIT and can perform impermissible tenant services (discussed below) which would otherwise taint our rental income under the REIT income tests. In enacting the taxable
REIT subsidiary rules, Congress intended that the arrangements between a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiaries be structured to ensure that a taxable REIT subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate
level of federal income taxation. As a result, the Act imposes certain limits on the ability of a taxable REIT subsidiary to deduct interest payments made to us. In addition, we will be obligated to
pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by the taxable REIT subsidiary if the economic arrangements between the REIT, the REIT's tenants and the taxable
REIT subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties.

Our
qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. We are required to satisfy these requirements on a
continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results.


Share Ownership Test and Organizational Requirement.

In order to qualify as a REIT, our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a
minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. Also, not more than 50%
in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly, or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable
year. In addition, we must meet certain other organizational requirements, including, but not limited to, that (i) the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and
(ii) we are managed by one or more trustees. We believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future. In
order to help comply with the 100 person test and the 50% share ownership test discussed above, we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further
concentration of share ownership.
However, such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements, and thereby failing to qualify as a REIT.

Gross Income Tests.

To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income tests. First, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable
year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments in real estate and/or real estate mortgage, dividends paid by another REIT and from some types of temporary investments. Second, at least
95% of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from any combination of income qualifying under the 75% test and dividends, non-real estate mortgage interest, some payments
under hedging instruments and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities. To qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests, rental payments
must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the tenant. Also, the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15% of the total rent. We may
generally provide services to tenants without "tainting" our rental income only if such services are "usually or customarily rendered" in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise
considered "impermissible services". If such services are impermissible, then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount, or are provided through an independent
contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements, or through a taxable REIT subsidiary. We believe that services provided to tenants by us either are usually or customarily
rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible, or, if considered impermissible services, will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an
independent contractor or taxable REIT subsidiary. However, we cannot provide any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with these positions.

Asset Tests.

In general, at the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our
assets: (1) at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets (which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts) and certain
cash related items; (2) not more than 25% of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75% asset class; (3) except for equity investments in other REITs,
qualified REIT subsidiaries (i.e., corporations owned 100% by a REIT that are not TRSs or REITs), or taxable REIT subsidiaries: (a) the value of any one issuer's securities owned by us may not
exceed 5% of the value of our total assets and (b) we may not own more than 10% of the value of or the voting securities of any one issuer; and (4) not more than 20% of our total assets
may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Securities for purposes of the asset tests may include debt securities. We currently own equity interests in certain entities
that have elected to be taxed as REITs for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded. If any such entity were to fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not meet the 10% voting stock
limitation and the 10% value limitation and we would fail to qualify as a REIT. We believe that we and each of the REITs we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for
REIT qualification. However, we cannot provide any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service might not disagree with our determinations.


Annual Distribution Requirements.

To qualify as a REIT, we are generally required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain
dividends, to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90% (95% for taxable years prior to 2001) of our REIT taxable income. These distributions must be paid either in the taxable
year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before
we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made. We intend to make timely distributions sufficient to
satisfy our annual distribution requirements. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, as
adjusted, we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates. We will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually
distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid, if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of: (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year;
(2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for the year; and (3) any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years. A REIT may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a
portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains. In that case, a REIT may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in
income as long-term capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the REIT. For purposes of the 4% excise tax described above, any retained amounts would be treated
as having been distributed.

Ownership of Partnership Interests By Us.

As a result of our ownership of the Operating Partnership, we will be considered to own and
derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the Operating Partnership, respectively, for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, including its share of assets and items of
income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies, provided that the Operating Partnership is taxed as a partnership and not as a "C" corporation for federal tax
purposes. Under the Internal Revenue Code, publicly traded partnerships are generally taxed as "C" corporations, unless at least 90% of their gross income consists of "qualifying income," such as
interest, dividends, real property rents, and gains from the sale or other disposition of real property held for investment. If the Operating Partnership at any time were considered a publicly traded
partnership and did not satisfy the 90% qualifying income test, then it would be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes which would jeopardize our status as a REIT. A partnership is a
"publicly traded partnership" if interests in such partnership are either traded on an established securities market or are "readily tradable on a secondary market." We believe that the Operating
Partnership and all other partnerships in which we own an interest are not publicly traded partnerships. It is possible, however, that the IRS could successfully assert that the Operating Partnership
is a publicly traded partnership as a result of the redemption right afforded to limited partners of the Operating Partnership. However, even if the Operating Partnership is classified as a publicly
traded partnership, we believe that the Operating Partnership satisfies the 90% gross income test necessary to avoid taxation as a "C" corporation and, as a result, such determination would not
adversely affect our REIT status.

Our Management Company and Other Subsidiaries.

A small portion of the cash to be used by the Operating Partnership to fund distributions
to us is expected to come from payments of dividends from management companies and other subsidiaries of the Company that have elected TRS status. These companies pay federal and state income tax at
the full applicable corporate rates. They will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes, but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to, which measures taken to minimize these taxes, will be
successful. To the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes, the cash available for distribution from these management companies by us to shareholders will be reduced accordingly.

State and Local Taxes.

We may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact
business or reside. Our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax consequence discussed above. Consequently, prospective


shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares.

Taxation of Domestic Shareholders Subject to U.S. Tax

General. If we qualify as a REIT, distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares, other than capital gain
distributions, will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits. These distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction
for shareholders that are corporations. In determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits, we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the
common shares.

To
the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits, such distributions will be considered a return of capital. Such
distributions will be treated as a tax free distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder's common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated. To the extent that such
distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder's tax basis, such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of his shares. Shareholders may not include in their individual
income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses.

Distributions
made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held
for more than one year. This treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year. It applies regardless of the period
for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares. Despite this general rule, corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary
income.

Generally,
we will classify a portion of our designated capital gains dividend as a 20% rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured Section 1250 gain
distribution. As the names suggest, a 20% rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20%. An unrecaptured
Section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25%.

If,
for any taxable year, we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of
beneficial interest, then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction. The
numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year. The denominator
of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest.

In
general, a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between:

(a)

the
amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition; and

(b)

the
shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the common shares.

The
gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset. Generally, the capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if
the common shares were held for more than one year. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 allows the IRS to issue regulations that would apply a capital gains tax rate of 25% to a portion of the capital
gain realized by a noncorporate holder of REIT Shares. The IRS has not issued these regulations. However, if the IRS does issue these regulations, they could affect the taxation of gain and loss
realized on the disposition of common


shares. Shareholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the impact of such rules on their capital gains tax.

In
general, a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less, determined after applying certain holding period rules, will be
treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as long-term capital gains. For shareholders who are individuals,
trusts and estates, the long-term capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable long-term capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the
shareholder were previously so treated.

We
may elect to retain (rather than distribute as is generally required) net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain. If we make this election, shareholders
must include in income, as long-term capital gain, their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain. Shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of
the tax paid by us on these gains. Accordingly, they will receive a credit or refund for the amount. Shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of
capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid. Our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately.

Taxation of Domestic Tax-Exempt Shareholders

Most tax-exempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income, which is often
referred to as UBTI. Unless a tax-exempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business, distributions to the
shareholder should not constitute UBTI. Similarly, if a tax-exempt shareholder sells common shares, the income from the sale should not constitute UBTI unless the shareholder held the
shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business.

However,
for tax-exempt shareholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified group legal
services plans, income from owning or selling common shares will constitute UBTI unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income
generated by its investment in common shares. These shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the Internal Revenue
Code.

In
addition, certain pension trusts that own more than 10% of a "pension-held REIT" must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the REIT as UBTI. We
have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pension-held REIT for purposes of this rule.

Taxation of Foreign Shareholders

The following is a discussion of certain anticipated United States federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to
a foreign shareholder. For purposes of this discussion, a "foreign shareholder" is any person other than:

(a)

a
citizen or resident of the United States;

(b)

a
corporation or partnership created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof; or

(c)

an
estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its source.

Distributions by Us.

Distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or
exchanges by us of United States real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our
earnings and profits. These distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of United


States federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30% rate, or a lower treaty rate, unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a United
States trade or business. Please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from REIT's. Dividends that are effectively
connected with a United States trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates, and are generally not subject to withholding. Certification and disclosure requirements must
be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption. A foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or a
lower treaty rate.

We
expect to withhold United States income tax at the rate of 30% on any distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless:

(a)

a
lower treaty rate applies and any required form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us; or

(b)

the
foreign shareholder files an IRS Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income.

A
distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted
basis of the shareholder's common shares. Instead, the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares. To the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common
shares, it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder's common shares. The tax treatment of this gain is described below.

As
a result of a legislative change made by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, we may be required to withhold 10% of any distribution in excess of our earnings and profits.
Consequently, although we intend to withhold at a rate of 30%, or a lower applicable treaty rate, on the entire amount of any distribution, to the extent that we do not do so, distributions will be
subject to withholding at a rate of 10%. However, a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the IRS if it subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in
excess of our earnings and profits, and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder's United States tax liability with respect to the distribution.

Distributions
to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends, other than those arising from the disposition of a United States real
property interest, generally will not be subject to United States federal income taxation unless:

(a)

the
investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder's United States trade or business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to
the same treatment as domestic shareholders, except that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax, as discussed above; or

(b)

the
foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a "tax home" in the United
States, in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual's capital gains.

Under
the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, which is known as FIRPTA, distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of United
States real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a United States trade or business. This rule applies
whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend. Accordingly, foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to U.S.
shareholders, subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. In addition, a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax
discussed above. We are required to withhold


35% of these distributions. The withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder's United States federal income tax liability.

Although
the law is not entirely clear on the matter, it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by U.S. shareholders would
be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends. Under that approach, foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit
against the United States federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains. In addition, foreign shareholders would be able to receive
from the IRS a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual United States federal income tax liability.

Sales of Common Shares.

Gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will
not be subject to United States taxation unless the shares constitute a "United States real property interest" within the meaning of FIRPTA. The common shares will not constitute a United States real
property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its stock
is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders. We believe that we are a domestically controlled REIT. Therefore, we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation
under FIRPTA. However, because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded,
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled REIT. In any event, gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to FIRPTA will be subject to U.S.
tax, if either:

(a)

the
investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder's United States trade or business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to
the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain; or

(b)

the
foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the United
States, in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual's capital gains.

Even
if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled REIT, gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to
United States taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a United States real property interest if:

(a)

the
class or series of shares being sold is "regularly traded," as defined by applicable IRS regulations, on an established securities market such as the New York Stock Exchange; and

(b)

the
selling foreign shareholder owned 5% or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout the five-year period ending on the date of
the sale or exchange.

If
gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under FIRPTA, the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular United States income tax with respect to the
gain in the same manner as a taxable U.S. shareholder, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax, a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the
possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations. The purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 10% of the purchase price.


Item 2. The Properties

As of December 31, 2001, the Company owned or had interests in a portfolio of 1,076 multifamily Properties located in 36 states containing 224,801
apartment units. The Company's Properties are more fully described as follows:

leases are generally for twelve months in length and typically require security deposits. The garden-style properties are generally defined as properties with two and/or three
story buildings while the mid-rise/high-rise are defined as properties greater than three story buildings. These two property types typically provide residents with amenities,
which may include a clubhouse, swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television access. Certain of these properties offer additional amenities such as saunas, whirlpools, spas, sports courts and
exercise rooms or other amenities. The ranch-style properties are defined as single story properties, which do not provide additional amenities for residents other than common laundry facilities and
cable television access.

It
is management's role to monitor compliance with Property policies and to provide preventive maintenance of the Properties including common areas, facilities and amenities. The Company
has a dedicated training and education department that creates and coordinates training and strategic implementation for the Company's property management personnel. The Company believes that, due in
part to its emphasis on training and employee quality, the Properties historically have had high occupancy rates.

The
distribution of the Properties throughout the United States reflects the Company's belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio from regional and economic
influences. At the same time, the Company has sought to create clusters of Properties within each of its primary markets in order to achieve economies of scale in management and operation. The Company
may nevertheless acquire additional multifamily properties located anywhere in the continental United States.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Only ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, which is not deemed material, was initiated during the year ended December 31, 2001. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company is not aware of any other litigation threatened against the Company other than routine litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business, some of which is
expected to be covered by liability insurance, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

At a Special Meeting of Shareholders of the Company held on December 12, 2001, the Company's common shareholders approved a proposal to increase the number
of authorized Common Shares from 350.0 million to 1.0 billion. Of the 241,190,136 Common Shares represented at the meeting (being


89.07% of the total Common Shares outstanding and entitled to vote at the record date for the meeting), 214,301,620 Common Shares (79.14% of the total Common Shares outstanding and 88.85% of the
Common Shares represented at the meeting) voted for the increase, 26,588,117 Common Shares voted against the increase and 300,399 Common shares abstained from the vote.

(1)

Adjusted Net Income ("ANI") represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")),
including gains or losses from sales of real estate, plus acquisition cost depreciation, plus amortization of goodwill, minus the accumulated acquisition cost depreciation on sold properties,
plus/minus extraordinary items and plus the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Depreciation associated with replacements and capital improvements is deducted in calculating ANI.
Acquisition cost depreciation represents depreciation for the initial cost of the property, including buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment and depreciation on capital improvements
identified in the acquisition underwriting and incurred in the first twenty-four months of ownership when the total exceeds $2,000 per unit.

(2)

Funds from Operations ("FFO") represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(("GAAP")), excluding gains or losses from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization (after adjustments for Partially Owned Properties and Unconsolidated Properties), plus/minus
extraordinary items, and plus the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and impairment charges. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to
reflect funds from operations on the same basis.

(3)

The Company believes that ANI and FFO are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because, along
with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, they provide investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make
capital expenditures. ANI and FFO in and of themselves do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net
income as an indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available
to fund cash needs. The Company's calculation of ANI and FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating ANI and FFO utilized by other real estate companies and may differ, for example, due to
variations among the Company's and other real estate company's accounting policies for replacement type items and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate
companies.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in connection with the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Due to the Company's ability to control the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning interests in the Unconsolidated Properties and
certain other entities in which the


Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. Capitalized terms used herein and not
defined are as defined elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Forward-looking
statements in this Item 7 as well as Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words "believes", "expects" and "anticipates" and other similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which
do not relate solely to historical matters identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results, performance,
or achievements of the Company to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such
differences include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

alternative
sources of capital to the Company are more expensive than anticipated;

•

occupancy
levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions, which are beyond the Company's control; and

•

additional
factors as discussed in Part I of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly those under "Risk Factors".

Readers
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release
any revisions to these forward-looking statements, which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

The
Company's acquisition and disposition activity has impacted overall results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. Significant changes in revenues and
expenses have resulted primarily from the consolidation of previously Unconsolidated Properties and the acquisition of Globe in July 2000, as well as the 2001 and the 2000 Acquired Properties,
which have been partially offset by the disposition of the 2001 and the 2000 Disposed Properties. Significant change in expenses has also
resulted from impairment charges (furniture rental and unconsolidated technology investments) recorded in 2001. This impact is discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.


Properties
that the Company owned for all of both 2001 and 2000 (the "2001 Same Store Properties"), which represented 181,951 units, impacted the Company's results of operations.
Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2000 and 1999 (the "2000 Same Store Properties"), which represented 155,910 units, also impacted the Company's results of operations. Both the 2001
Same Store Properties and 2000 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs.

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2001 to the year ended December 31, 2000

For the year ended December 31, 2001, income before allocation to Minority Interests, income from investments in unconsolidated entities, net gain on sales
of real estate, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased by approximately $39.5 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2000.

Revenues
from the 2001 Same Store Properties increased primarily as a result of higher rental rates charged to new residents and resident renewals and an increase in income from billing
residents for their share of utility costs as well as other ancillary services provided to residents. Property operating expenses from the 2001 Same Store Properties, which include property and
maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance and an allocation of property management expenses, increased primarily attributable to a $5.4 million, or 5.6%, increase in utilities and an
$8.2 million, or 5.5%, increase in payroll costs. The following tables provide comparative revenue, expenses, net operating income and weighted average occupancy for the 2001 Same Store
Properties:

For
2002 Properties which the Company acquired prior to December 31, 2000 and will continue to own through December 31, 2002, the Company expects to see revenue growth
within a range of being slightly
lower by 1.25% to slightly higher by as much as 0.5%; to maintain expense growth between a range of 1.0% to 1.5%; and expects NOI within a range of being slightly lower by 2.9% to slightly higher by
0.2%. These estimated changes are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, maintaining an overall average occupancy rate of 93.0%.

Rental
income from properties other than 2001 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $57.4 million primarily as a result of revenue from the Company's 2001 and 2000
Acquired Properties, additional 2001 Partially Owned Properties, and the 2001 Disposition Properties.

Interest
income-investment in mortgage notes decreased by approximately $2.4 million as a result of the Company consolidating these previously Unconsolidated Properties in
July 2001. The Company anticipates no additional interest income will be recognized on these mortgage notes in future years as the Company now consolidates the results related to these
previously Unconsolidated Properties.


Interest
and other income decreased by approximately $3.4 million, primarily as a result of lower balances available for investment and related interest rates being earned on the
Company's short-term investment accounts.

Property
management expenses include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Company's Properties. These expenses increased by approximately
$0.7 million or less than 1%. The Company continues to acquire properties in major metropolitan areas and dispose of assets in smaller multi-family rental markets where the Company does not
have a significant management presence. As a result, the Company was able to maintain off-site management expenses at a constant level between the two reporting periods.

Fee
and asset management revenues and fee and asset management expenses increased as a result of the Company continuing to manage Properties that were sold and/or contributed to various
unconsolidated joint venture entities. As of December 31, 2001, the Company managed 16,539 units for third parties and the unconsolidated joint venture entities.

Furniture
income and furniture expenses are associated with the operation of the furniture rental business assumed in connection with the Globe acquisition, which occurred in
July 2000. Furniture expenses include a depreciation charge on furniture held in inventory and property and equipment directly related to the furniture business. The Company sold its furniture
rental business for approximately $30.0 million on January 11, 2002.

The
Company recorded impairment charges in 2001 totaling approximately $71.8 million, of which $60.0 million is related to the furniture rental business and approximately
$11.8 million is related to certain investments in technology entities. See Footnote 20 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Interest
expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $11.0 million. During 2001, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately
$28.2 million as compared to $17.7 million for the year ended 2000. This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in
development activities. The effective interest cost on all of the Company's indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 6.90% as compared to 7.25% for the year ended
December 31, 2000. For 2002, the Company expects to refinance approximately $550 million of indebtedness and to incur interest costs ranging from 6.5% to 7.0% per annum.

General
and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $9.0 million between the years under comparison. This increase was
primarily due to the addition of corporate personnel, recruiting fees for the new President, retirement plan expenses for certain key executives, and higher overall compensation expenses including a
current year expense associated with the vesting of restricted shares/awards to key employees earned over the past three years.

Net
gain on sales of real estate decreased approximately $49.1 million between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily the result of a fewer number of units sold
during the year ended December 31, 2001 (11,818 units including the joint venture Properties) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000 (20,648 units including the joint venture
Properties).

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2000 to the year ended December 31, 1999

For the year ended December 31, 2000, income before allocation to Minority Interests, income from investments in unconsolidated entities, net gain on sales
of real estate, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased by $69.5 million, or 21.3%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 1999.


Revenues
from the 2000 Same Store Properties increased primarily as a result of higher rental rates charged to new residents and resident renewals and an increase in income from billing
residents for their share of utility costs as well as other ancillary services provided to residents. Property operating expenses from the 2000 Same Store Properties, which include property and
maintenance, real estate
taxes and insurance and an allocation of property management expenses, increased primarily attributable to a $1.8 million, or 2.1%, increase in utilities and a $9.1 million, or 7.4%
increase in payroll costs. The following tables provide comparative revenue, expenses, net operating income and weighted average occupancy for the 2000 Same Store Properties:

Rental
income from properties other than 2000 Same Store Properties increased by approximately $178.3 million primarily as a result of revenue from the Company's corporate housing
business and the acquisition of Properties during 2000, including the consolidation of previously Unconsolidated Properties.

Interest
and other income increased by approximately $12.0 million, primarily as a result of disposition proceeds earning interest in various tax deferred 1031 exchange accounts.
These proceeds are invested in money market investments until the Company purchases additional multi-family properties.

Property
management expenses include expenses associated with the self-management of the Company's Properties. These expenses increased by approximately $14.8 million
primarily due to the continued expansion of the Company's property management business and higher overall compensation expenses. During 2000, the Company incurred the full year impact of assuming the
property management business of LFT and also assumed management offices in Cincinnati, Ohio and Norwood, Massachusetts related to the acquisition of Globe and Grove, respectively. Also included in
compensation expense is the current year expense associated with the vesting of restricted shares/awards to key employees earned over the past year.

Fee
and asset management revenues and fee and asset management expenses increased as a result of the Company continuing to manage Properties that were either sold and/or contributed to
various joint venture entities.

Furniture
income and furniture expenses are associated with the operation of the furniture rental business assumed in connection with the Globe acquisition, which occurred in
July 2000. Furniture expenses include a depreciation charge on furniture held in inventory and property and equipment directly related to the furniture business.


The
Company recorded impairment charges in 2000 totaling approximately $1.0 million related to certain investments in technology entities.

Interest
expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased by approximately $37.5 million. During 2000, the Company capitalized interest costs of
approximately $17.7 million as compared to $8.1 million for the year ended 1999. This capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities
engaged in development activities. The effective interest cost on all of the Company's indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2000 was 7.25% as compared to 7.05% for the year ended
December 31, 1999.

General
and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $4.1 million between the periods under comparison. This increase was
primarily due to the addition of corporate personnel and higher overall compensation expenses including a current year expense associated with the awarding of restricted shares to key employees in
2000.

Net
gain on sales of real estate increased approximately $104.9 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily the result of a larger number of units
sold during the year ended December 31, 2000 (20,648 units, including the joint venture Properties) as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999 (9,183 units).

Net
loss from extraordinary items increased approximately $5.1 million related primarily to pre-payment penalties incurred on the refinancing of $208 million in
mortgage debt.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

For the Year Ended December 31, 2001

As of January 1, 2001, the Company had approximately $23.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $399.5 million available under its lines
of credit, of which $53.5 million was restricted (not available to be drawn). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided
by operating activities, the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2001 was approximately $51.6 million and the amount available on the Company's line of credit was
$505.0 million, of which $59.0 million was restricted (not available to be drawn).

Part
of the Company's acquisition and development funding strategy and the funding of the Company's investment in various joint ventures is to utilize its lines of credit and to
subsequently repay the lines of credit from the disposition of Properties, retained cash flows or the issuance of additional equity or debt securities. Continuing to utilize this strategy during the
year ended 2001, the Company:

•

disposed
of forty-nine Properties (including two Unconsolidated Properties) and two vacant parcels of land and received net proceeds of
$399.1 million;

•

issued
$300.0 million of unsecured debt receiving net proceeds of $297.4 million;

•

sold
and/or contributed eleven properties to a joint venture and received net proceeds of $167.6 million;

•

issued
approximately 3.6 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $74.4 million;

•

issued
$60.0 million of four new series of Preference Interests and received net proceeds of $58.5 million;

•

obtained
$91.6 million in new mortgage financing; and

•

received
$61.4 million of principal repayments on its investment in second and third mortgages on previously Unconsolidated Properties.

All
of these proceeds were utilized to either:

•

repay
the lines of credit;


•

redeem
the Company's Series A and F Preferred Shares;

•

repay
mortgage indebtedness on selected Properties;

•

repay
public unsecured debt;

•

invest
in unconsolidated entities; and

•

purchase
additional Properties.

During
the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company:

•

reduced
its line of credit borrowings by approximately $160.5 million as compared to its December 31, 2000 balance outstanding;

•

funded
$210.5 million to redeem all of its Series A and F Preferred Shares;

•

repaid
approximately $364.2 million of mortgages due at or prior to maturity and/or at the disposition date of respective Properties;

•

funded
a net of $174.6 million in accordance with its development and joint venture agreements; and

•

acquired
fourteen Properties and vacant land utilizing cash of $297.8 million.

From
January 1, 2002 through February 5, 2002, the Company:

•

disposed
of four Properties consisting of 466 units for approximately $15.5 million;

•

disposed
of the furniture rental business for approximately $30.0 million in cash;

•

repaid
$1.9 million of mortgage debt at or prior to maturity on two Properties; and

•

repaid
$100.0 million of 9.375% fixed rate public notes at maturity.

During
2002, the Company expects to fund approximately $33.5 million related to wholly owned developments and joint venture projects under development. In connection with one
joint venture agreement, the Company has an obligation to fund up to an additional $6.5 million to guarantee third party construction financing. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has
22 projects under development with estimated completion dates ranging from March 31, 2002 through December 31, 2003.

For
one joint venture agreement, the Company's joint venture partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell
its interest in


the project to the Company based on such value. If the Company chooses not to purchase the interest, it must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value. The Company's
joint venture partner must exercise this right as to all projects within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property.

For
the second joint venture agreement, the Company's joint venture partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to require the Company to purchase the joint
venture partners' interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price. If the Company and the joint venture partner are unable to agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals. If the
appraised values vary by more than 10%, both the Company and the joint venture partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value.
The Company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize the joint venture partner to sell the project at or above the agreed-upon value to an unrelated third
party. Five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property, any projects remaining unsold must be purchased by the Company at the
agreed-upon price.

The
Company has a policy of capitalizing expenditures made for new assets, including newly acquired Properties, and the costs associated with placing these assets into service.
Expenditures for improvements and renovations that significantly enhance the value of existing assets or substantially extend the useful life of an asset are also capitalized. Expenditures for
in-the-unit replacement-type items such as appliances, draperies, carpeting and floor coverings, mechanical equipment and certain
furniture and fixtures are also capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred. With respect to acquired Properties, the Company has determined
that it generally spends $1,000 per unit during its first three years of ownership to fully improve and enhance these Properties to meet the Company's standards. In regard to
replacement-type items described above, the Company generally expects to spend $250 per unit on an annual recurring basis.

During
the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company's total improvements to real estate approximated $150.9 million. Replacements, which include new carpeting, appliances,
mechanical equipment, fixtures, vinyl floors and blinds inside the unit approximated $56.0 million, or $276 per unit. Building improvements for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 Acquired Properties
approximated $26.4 million, or $496 per unit. Building improvements for all of the Company's pre-1999 Acquired Properties approximated $57.2 million or $383 per unit. In
addition, approximately $7.2 million was spent on twelve specific assets related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets. Also included in total improvements to real estate was
approximately $4.1 million on commercial/other assets and Partially Owned Properties. Such improvements to real estate were primarily funded from net cash provided by operating activities.
Total improvements to real estate for 2002 are estimated at $135.0 million.

During
the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company's total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and
fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Company's property management offices and its corporate offices, was approximately $6.9 million. Such additions to non-real estate
property were funded from net cash provided by operating activities. Total additions to non-real estate property for 2002 are estimated at $6.8 million.

The
Company has a policy of capitalizing expenditures made for rental furniture and related property and equipment. The Company, prior to the sale of its furniture rental business,
purchased furniture to replace furniture that had been sold and to maintain adequate levels of rental furniture to meet existing and new customer needs. Expenditures for property and equipment that
significantly enhance the value of existing assets or substantially extend the useful life of an asset are also capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs related to property and
equipment are expensed as incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2001, total additions to rental furniture


approximated $18.6 million and property and equipment approximated $2.5 million. The furniture rental business was sold on January 11, 2002.

Minority
Interests as of December 31, 2001 increased by $23.2 million when compared to December 31, 2000 principally as a result of the consolidation of
twenty-one former Unconsolidated Properties and the issuance of $60.0 million of Preference Interests, partially offset by the conversions of OP Units into Common Shares. The
primary factors that impacted this account in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year were:

•

distributions
declared to Minority Interests, which amounted to $40.2 million for 2001 (excluding Preference Unit/Interest distributions);

•

the
allocation of income from operations in the amount of $32.8 million;

•

the
allocation of Minority Interests from Partially Owned Properties in the amount of $2.2 million;

•

the
conversion of OP Units into Common Shares; and

•

the
issuance of Common Shares, OP Units, Preference Units and Preference Interests during 2001.

Total
distributions paid in 2001 amounted to $475.8 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared in the fourth
quarter of 2001 and paid in 2002.

The
Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing Properties and certain scheduled
unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit. The Company considers its cash
provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions. The Company also expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as
scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and
equity securities, including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain Properties. During March 2002, the Company anticipates the issuance of unsecured notes in
the amount of approximately $300.0 million. In addition, the Company has certain unencumbered Properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital
markets are unavailable to the Company or the cost of alternative sources of capital to the Company is too high. These unencumbered Properties are in excess of the value of unencumbered Properties the
Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit.

The
Company has a revolving credit facility to provide the Operating Partnership with potential borrowings of up to $700 million. As of February 28, 2002,
$262.0 million was outstanding under this facility. This credit Facility is scheduled to expire in August 2002 and the Company has begun the process of replacing its line of credit with
a new line of credit, which it believes will be on at least as favorable terms.

In
connection with the Globe acquisition, the Company assumed a revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to $55.0 million. This credit facility was terminated on
May 31, 2001.

In
connection with the Wellsford Merger, the Company provided a credit enhancement with respect to certain tax-exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a
multifamily development project. As of February 28, 2002, this enhancement was still in effect at a commitment amount of $12.7 million.


Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company limits these risks by following established risk
management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.

The
Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the
underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect
on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.

On
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137 and 138),

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

, which requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure those instruments at
fair value. Additionally, the fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders' equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes
and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. When the terms of an underlying transaction are modified, or when the underlying transaction is terminated or completed, all changes in the fair value
of the instrument are marked-to-market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures. Any derivative instrument used for risk management
that does not meet the hedging criteria of SFAS No. 133 is marked-to-market each period.

As
of January 1, 2001, the adoption of the new standard resulted in derivative instruments reported on the balance sheet as liabilities of approximately $6.6 million; an
adjustment of approximately $5.3 million to accumulated other comprehensive loss, which are gains and losses not affecting retained earnings in the consolidated statement of shareholders'
equity; and a charge of approximately $1.3 million as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations.

At
December 31, 2001, the Company had entered into swaps which have been designated as cash flow hedges with an aggregate notional amount of $626.4 million at interest
rates ranging from 3.65% to 6.15% maturing at various dates ranging from 2003 to 2007 with a net liability fair value of
$23.3 million; and swaps which have been designated as fair value hedges with an aggregate notional amount of $396.4 million at interest rates ranging from 4.46% to 7.25% maturing at
various dates ranging from 2003 to 2011 with a net asset fair value of $4.6 million.

At
December 31, 2001, the Company's joint venture development partners had entered into swaps to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on unconsolidated floating rate construction
mortgage loans. The Company has recorded its proportionate share of these qualifying hedges on its consolidated balance sheet. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges with a current
aggregate notional amount of $302.5 million (notional amounts range from $139.7 million to $525.1 million over the terms of the swaps) at interest rates ranging from 4.13% to
7.35% maturing at various dates ranging from 2002 to 2005 with a net liability fair value of $10.4 million.

As
of December 31, 2001, there were approximately $32.6 million in deferred losses, net, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. On December 31, 2001, the
net derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as other liabilities of approximately $18.7 million and as a reduction to investment in unconsolidated entities of approximately
$10.4 million. The Company expects to recognize an estimated $14.3 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense during the twelve months ending
December 31, 2002, of which $6.5 million is related to the development joint venture swaps.


For the Year Ended December 31, 2000

As of January 1, 2000, the Company had approximately $29.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $400 million available on its lines of
credit, of which $65.8 million was restricted (not available to be drawn). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs, the Company's cash and cash
equivalents balance at December 31, 2000 was approximately $23.8 million and the amount available on the Company's line of credit was $399.5 million, of which $53.5 million
was restricted (not available to be drawn).

Part
of the Company's strategy in funding the purchase of multifamily properties, funding its Properties in the development stage and the funding of the Company's investment in joint
ventures is to utilize its line of credit and to subsequently repay the line of credit from the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or the net proceeds from the disposition of Properties.
Utilizing this strategy during 2000, the Company:

•

obtained
mortgage financing on forty-six previously unencumbered Properties and received net proceeds of $484.4 million;

•

disposed
of fifty-three properties (including the sale of the Company's entire interest in three Unconsolidated Properties) and received net proceeds of
$631.2 million;

•

sold
and/or contributed thirty-four properties to three separate joint ventures and received net proceeds of $97.0 million;

•

issued
approximately 1.8 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $32.9 million; and

•

issued
five new series of Preference Interests and received net proceeds of $142.4 million.

During
the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company:

•

repaid
four unsecured note issues totaling $208.0 million;

•

repaid
approximately $171.8 million of mortgage indebtedness on eighty-three Properties;

•

funded
$160.9 million related to the development, earnout, and joint venture agreements;

•

purchased
twenty-eight Properties (excluding Grove) for a total purchase price of approximately $654.1 million;

•

funded
$5.2 million to acquire all third party equity interests in eleven former Unconsolidated Properties;

•

funded
$58.5 million related to the purchase of two separate vacant land parcels for future development;

•

funded
$1.25 million to acquire an additional ownership interest in 14 former Unconsolidated Properties which, as a result, were reclassified as
Partially Owned Properties; and

•

acquired
$25.0 million of 8.25% preferred securities of WRP Convertible Trust I, an affiliate of WRP Newco.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require
the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. The Company believes that the following
critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill

The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for impairment indicators. The
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause the
Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.

Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate

The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30-year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures
and equipment and replacements components over a 5-year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments

The valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133 requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair
value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where
these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has chosen to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25, which results in no compensation expense for options
issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding market value of the Company's Common Shares on the date of grant, instead of Statement


No. 123, which would result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock-based compensation issued.

Adjusted Net Income

For the year ended December 31, 2001, Adjusted Net Income ("ANI") available to Common Shares and OP units decreased $18.3 million as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2000, ANI available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $110.0 million, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 1999.

Acquisition cost depreciation represents depreciation for the initial cost of the property, including buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment and
depreciation on capital improvements identified in the acquisition underwriting and incurred in the first twenty-four months of ownership when the total cost exceeds $2,000 per
unit.

**

Adjusted Net Income represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), including
gains or losses from sales of real estate, plus acquisition cost depreciation, plus amortization of goodwill, minus the accumulated acquisition cost depreciation on sold properties, plus/minus
extraordinary items and plus the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Depreciation associated with replacements and capital improvements is deducted in calculating
ANI.

The
Company believes that ANI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because, along with cash flows from operating
activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. ANI in and
of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's
performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. The Company's
calculation of ANI may differ from the methodology for calculating ANI utilized by other real estate companies and may differ, for example, due to variations among the Company's and other real estate
companies' accounting policies for replacement type items and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.


Funds From Operations

For the year ended December 31, 2001, Funds From Operations ("FFO") available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $60.5 million, or 8.3%, as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2000, FFO available to Common Shares and OP Units increased $106.6 million, or 17.2%, as compared to
the year ended December 31, 1999.

from Unconsolidated Properties. Excludes $4,353 and $1,476 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, related to the minority interests' share of depreciation from Partially
Owned Properties.

FFO
represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (("GAAP")), excluding gains or losses from sales of property,
plus depreciation and amortization (after adjustments for Partially Owned Properties and Unconsolidated Properties), plus/minus extraordinary items, and plus the cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle and impairment charges. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.

The
Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because, along with cash flows from operating
activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO in and
of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's
performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. The Company's
calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other real estate companies and may differ, for example, due to variations among the Company's and other real estate
companies' accounting policies for replacement type items and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.


Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Market risks relating to the Company's operations result primarily from changes in short-term LIBOR interest rates. The Company does not have any
direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk.

The
Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's unsecured line of credit. The Company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations
to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures, while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing
long-term fixed rate financing. The Company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including its assessment of the current and
future economic environment.

The
Company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk. Interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis
or vice versa. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes.

The
fair values of the Company's financial instruments (including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents, other assets, lines of credit, accounts
payable and accrued expenses, rents received in advance and other liabilities) approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature, terms and interest rates that approximate current
market rates. The fair value of the Company's mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes approximates their carrying value at December 31, 2001.

The
Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $896.0 million, or 15.6% of the Company's total debt at December 31, 2001, including the effects of
any interest rate protection agreements. If market rates of interest on all of the Company's floating rate debt permanently increased by 32 basis points (a 10% increase), the increase in interest
expense on the Company's floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.9 million. If market rates of interest on all of the Company's floating rate debt
permanently decreased by 32 basis points (a 10% decrease), the decrease in interest expense on the Company's floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately
$2.9 million.

These
amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company's financial instruments. The foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the
Company's floating rate debt and does not differentiate among maturities. These analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an
environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific
actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Company's financial structure or results other than interest expense.

The
Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and, therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any assurance that
fixed rate, long term debt will be available to the Company at advantageous pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To
the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential Properties Trust

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Equity Residential Properties Trust (the "Company") as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the accompanying index to financial statements and schedule. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Equity Residential Properties
Trust at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the Company changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES TRUST

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Business and Formation of the Company

Equity Residential Properties Trust, formed in March 1993 ("EQR"), is a self-administered and self-managed equity real estate
investment trust ("REIT"). As used herein, the term "Company" means EQR, and its subsidiaries, as the survivor of the mergers between EQR and each of Wellsford Residential Property Trust, Evans
Withycombe Residential, Inc., Merry Land & Investment Company, Inc. and Lexford Residential Trust (collectively, the "Mergers"). The Company also includes the businesses formerly
operated by Globe Business Resources, Inc. ("Globe") and Grove Property Trust ("Grove"). The Company completed the sale of its Globe furniture rental business on January 11, 2002. The
Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code 1986, as amended (the "Code").

EQR
is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2001, owned an approximate 92.1% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership"). The
Company conducts substantially all of its business and owns substantially all of its assets through the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership is, in turn, directly or indirectly, a partner,
member or shareholder of numerous partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations which have been established primarily to own fee simple title to multifamily properties or to conduct
property management activities and other businesses related to the ownership and operation of multifamily residential real estate. References to the Company include the Operating Partnership and each
of the partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations controlled by the Operating Partnership or EQR.

The
Company is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, management, operation and disposition of multifamily properties. As of December 31, 2001, the Company owned or had interests
in a portfolio of 1,076 multifamily properties (individually a "Property" and collectively the "Properties") containing 224,801 apartment units located in 36 states consisting of the following:

Number of

Properties

Number of

Units

Wholly Owned Properties


199,698

Partially Owned Properties


6,931

Unconsolidated Properties


18,172

Total Properties

1,076

224,801

The
Company accounts for its ownership interest in the 955 "Wholly Owned Properties" under the consolidation method of accounting. The Company beneficially owns 100% fee simple title to
948 of the 955 Wholly Owned Properties. The Company has a leasehold estate ownership interest in one Property. As such, the Company owns the real estate building and improvements and leases the land
underlying the improvements under a long-term ground lease that expires in 2066. This one Property is consolidated and reflected as a real estate asset while the ground lease is accounted
for as an operating lease in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

. The Company owns
the debt collateralized by two Properties and owns an interest in the debt collateralized by the remaining four Properties. The Company consolidates its interest in these six Properties in accordance
with the accounting standards outlined in the AcSEC guidance for real estate acquisition, development and construction arrangements issued in the CPA letter dated February 10, 1986, and as
such, reflects these assets as real estate in the consolidated financial statements.

F-11

The
"Partially Owned Properties" are controlled and partially owned by the Company but have partners with minority interests and are accounted for under the consolidation method of
accounting. The "Unconsolidated Properties" are partially owned but not controlled by the Company and consist of investments in partnership interests and/or subordinated mortgages that are accounted
for under the equity method of accounting.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The Mergers and acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16. The fair value of the
consideration given by the Company in the Mergers was used as the valuation basis for each of the combinations. The accompanying consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include the
results of the Properties purchased through the Mergers and through acquisitions from their respective closing dates.

Due
to the Company's ability as general partner to control either through ownership or by contract the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, other than entities owning interests in
the Unconsolidated Properties and certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary has been consolidated with the Company for financial
reporting purposes. In July 2001, the Company acquired 100% of a management company entity, which had a controlling ownership interest in a portfolio of 21 previously Unconsolidated Properties.
Subsequent to this transaction, the Company consolidated these 21 Properties. In September 2001, the Company acquired the remaining 5% of the preferred stock it did not own and 100% of the
voting common stock in two other management company entities. As a result, the Company now wholly-owns these two entities. The Company consolidated the results of these two entities prior
to this transaction despite not having legal control, the effects of which were immaterial.

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation

Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation less an adjustment, if any, for impairment. A land value is assigned based on the purchase price if
land is acquired separately or based on market research if acquired in a merger or in a single or portfolio acquisition.

Depreciation
is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company uses a 30-year estimated life for buildings and a
five-year estimated life for initial furniture, fixtures and equipment. Replacements inside a unit such as appliances and carpeting, are depreciated over a five-year estimated
life. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are
capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally five to ten years. Initial direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense approximates the deferral and amortization of initial
direct leasing costs over the lease terms. Property sales or dispositions are
recorded when title transfers and sufficient consideration has been received by the Company. Upon disposition, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts.
Any gain or loss on sale of disposition is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

The
Company classifies real estate assets as real estate held for disposition when it is certain a property will be disposed.

F-12

The
Company classifies Properties under development and/or expansion and properties in the lease up phase as construction in progress until construction has been completed and all
certificates of occupancy permits have been obtained. The Company also classifies land relating to construction in progress as land on its balance sheet.

Asset Impairment

For real estate properties held for use, the Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of

, in determining whether an impairment loss exists. The Company first determines whether
any indicators of impairment exist. If indicators exist, the Company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows for an operating property against the carrying amount of that property. If the
sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the property, an impairment loss would be recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying
amount of the property.

For
real estate properties to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the real estate, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the
carrying amount of the real estate measured at the time it is certain that the Company will sell the property. Real estate held for disposition is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its
estimated fair value, less its cost to sell.

For
all other assets, including property and equipment and goodwill, the Company also follows the guidance in SFAS No. 121 in determining whether an impairment loss exists. The
Company reviews the current net book value taking into consideration existing business and economic conditions as well as projected operating cash flows. See Note 20 for further discussion.

In
August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets

, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2002,
which did not have any impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of
three months or less, at the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions. The combined account balances at each institution
periodically exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC
insurance coverage. The Company believes that the risk is not significant, as the Company does not anticipate their non-performance.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain the Company's lines of credit, long-term financings and costs for certain interest
rate protection agreements. These costs are amortized over the terms of the related debt. Unamortized financing costs are written-off when debt is

F-13

retired before the maturity date. The accumulated amortization of such deferred financing costs was $22.9 million and $17.7 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Rental Furniture

Rental furniture is stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis at a rate of 1% per month, which is designed to approximate an estimated
useful life of four years with provision for a 50% residual value. The accumulated depreciation of rental furniture was $419,000 and $725,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation expense is provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of three to ten years.
The accumulated depreciation of property and equipment was $2.6 million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 20 years. The Company periodically reviews goodwill for impairment and if a
permanent decline in value has occurred, the Company would reduce its goodwill balance to fair value. The accumulated amortization of goodwill was $5.5 million and $1.8 million at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

In
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. SFAS No. 142 requires companies to
eliminate the amortization of goodwill in favor of a periodic impairment based approach. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company adopted
the standard effective January 1, 2002, which did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company limits these risks by following established risk
management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.

The
Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the
underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect
on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

On
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137 and 138),

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

, which requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure those instruments at
fair value. Additionally, the fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders' equity
or net income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. When the terms of an underlying transaction are
modified, or when the underlying transaction is terminated or completed, all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked-to-market with changes in value included in
net income each period until

F-14

the instrument matures. Any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria of SFAS No. 133 is marked-to-market each period.

As
of January 1, 2001, the adoption of the new standard resulted in derivative instruments reported on the balance sheet as liabilities of approximately $6.6 million; an
adjustment of approximately $5.3 million to accumulated other comprehensive loss, which are gains and losses not affecting retained earnings in the consolidated statement of shareholders'
equity; and a charge of approximately $1.3 million as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations.

At
December 31, 2001, the Company had entered into swaps which have been designated as cash flow hedges with an aggregate notional amount of $626.4 million at interest
rates ranging from 3.65125% to 6.15% maturing at various dates ranging from 2003 to 2007 with a net liability fair value of $23.3 million; and swaps which have been designated as fair value
hedges with an aggregate notional amount of $396.4 million at interest rates ranging from 4.458% to 7.25% maturing at various dates ranging from 2003 to 2011 with a net asset fair value of
$4.6 million.

At
December 31, 2001, the Company's joint venture development partners had entered into swaps to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on unconsolidated floating rate construction
mortgage loans. The Company has recorded its proportionate share of these qualifying hedges on its consolidated balance sheet. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges with a current
aggregate notional amount of $302.5 million (notional amounts range from $139.7 million to $525.1 million over the terms of the swaps) at interest rates ranging from 4.13% to
7.35% maturing at various dates ranging from 2002 to 2005 with a net liability fair value of $10.4 million.

As
of December 31, 2001, there were approximately $32.6 million in deferred losses, net, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. On December 31, 2001, the
net derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as other liabilities of approximately $18.7 million and as a reduction to investment in unconsolidated entities of approximately
$10.4 million. The Company expects to recognize an estimated $14.3 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense during the twelve months ending
December 31, 2002, of which $6.5 million is related to the development joint venture swaps.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair values of the Company's financial instruments (excluding the Company's investment in mortgage notes—see Note 8), including cash and
cash equivalents, mortgage notes payable, other notes payable, lines of credit and other financial instruments, approximate their carrying or contract values.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a
straight-line basis. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Leases entered into between a resident and a Property for the rental of an apartment unit are
year-to-year, renewable upon consent of both parties on a year-to-year or month-to-month basis.

Leases
of furniture generally have an initial term of three to six months in duration and can be extended by the customer on a month-to-month basis. Furniture
rentals are accounted for as operating leases, and revenue is recorded in the month earned. For sales of furniture, as well as rental buyouts,

F-15

revenue and related cost of sales are recorded when the furniture is delivered or taken off lease. Revenues from both furniture rentals and sales are included in furniture income while the associated
costs of those rentals and sales are included in furniture operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

The
Company adopted the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101,

Revenue Recognition,

effective October 1,
2000. SAB No. 101 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. The adoption of SAB No. 101 did not have a material impact on the
Company's financial condition and results of operations.

Income Taxes

Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations of the Properties and management business, the results of operations generally
contain no provision for federal income taxes. The Company is subject to certain state and local income, excise and franchise taxes. The aggregate cost of land and depreciable property for federal
income tax purposes as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately $8.6 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively.

Effective
in 2001, the Company has elected Taxable REIT Subsidiary ("TRS") status for certain of its corporate subsidiaries. The provisions for federal income taxes for these TRS
entities were not material during 2001 and were recognized as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

During
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company's tax treatment of distributions were as follows:

Minority Interests

Operating Partnership: Net income is allocated to minority interests based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. The ownership
percentage is calculated by dividing the number of Operating Partnership Units ("OP Units") held by the minority interests by the total OP
Units held by the minority interests and the Company. Issuance of additional common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Shares"), and OP Units changes the ownership
interests of both the minority interests and the Company. Such transactions and the proceeds therefrom are treated as capital transactions.

Partially
Owned Properties: The Company reflects minority interests in partially owned properties on the balance sheet for the portion of properties consolidated by the Company that are
not wholly owned by the Company. The earnings or losses from those properties attributable to the minority

F-16

interests are reflected as minority interests in partially owned properties in the consolidated statements of operations.

Use of Estimates

In preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the previously reported financial statements in order to provide comparability with the 2001 statements reported
herein. These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations or shareholders' equity.

Reportable Segments

The Company has one primary reportable business segment, which consists of investment in rental real estate. The Company's primary business is owning, managing
and operating multifamily residential properties, which includes the generation of rental and other related income through the leasing of apartment units to residents.

The
primary financial measure for the Company's rental real estate segment is net operating income ("NOI"), which represents rental income less: 1) property and maintenance
expense; 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense; and 3) property management expense (all as reflected in the accompanying statements of operations). Current year NOI is compared to
prior year NOI and current year budgeted NOI as a measure of financial performance.

During
the acquisition, development and/or disposition of real estate, the NOI return on total capitalized costs is the primary measure of financial performance (capitalization rate) the
Company considers.

The
Company's fee and asset management activity and furniture rental/sales activities are immaterial and do not meet the threshold requirements of a reportable segment as provided for in
SFAS No. 131.

All
revenues are from external customers and there is no customer who contributed 10% or more of the Company's total revenues during 2001, 2000 or 1999.

Other

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations.

SFAS No. 141 requires
companies to account for all business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. SFAS No. 141 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company
adopted the standard effective January 1, 2002, which did not have any impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

F-17

3. Business Combinations

On October 1, 1999, the Company acquired Lexford Residential Trust ("LFT")(the "LFT Merger"), which included 402 Properties containing 36,609 units and
other related assets for a total purchase price of approximately $738 million. In connection with the LFT Merger, each outstanding common share of beneficial interest of LFT was converted into
0.926 of a Common Share of the Company. The purchase price consisted of 8.0 million Common Shares issued by the Company with a market value of $181.1 million, the assumption of mortgage
indebtedness, a term loan and a line of credit in the amount of $528.3 million, the acquisition of other assets of approximately $40.9 million, the assumption of other liabilities of
approximately $25.3 million and other merger related costs of approximately $24.5 million.

On
July 11, 2000, the Company acquired Globe in an all cash and debt transaction valued at $163.2 million. Globe provided fully furnished short-term housing
through an inventory of leased housing units to transferring or temporarily assigned corporate personnel, new hires, trainees, consultants and individual customers throughout the United States.
Additionally, Globe rents and sells furniture to a diversified base of commercial and residential customers throughout the United States. Shareholders of Globe received $13.00 per share, which
approximated $58.7 million in cash based on the 4.5 million Globe shares outstanding. In addition, the Company:

•

Acquired
$94.8 million in other Globe assets and assumed $29.6 million in other Globe liabilities;

•

Allocated
$68.4 million to goodwill;

credit of $29.5 million outstanding.

On
July 21, 2000, the Company, through its Globe subsidiary, acquired Temporary Quarters, Inc., the leading corporate housing provider in Atlanta, Georgia, in a
$3.3 million all cash transaction.

During
2001 and prior to the one-year anniversary of the Globe acquisition, the Company recorded net increases to goodwill of $9.5 million to reallocate the original
purchase price recorded at the acquisition date. Also during 2001, the Company recorded a $60.0 million asset impairment charge related to its furniture rental business. See Note 20.

On
January 11, 2002, the Company sold the former Globe furniture rental business for approximately $30.0 million in cash, which approximated the net book value at the sale
date. The Company has retained ownership of the former Globe short-term furnished housing business, which is now known as Equity Corporate Housing.

On
October 31, 2000, the Company acquired Grove, which included 60 properties containing 7,308 units for a total purchase price of $463.2 million. The Company:

•

Paid
$17.00 per share or $141.6 million in cash to purchase the 8.3 million outstanding common shares of Grove;

•

Paid
$17.00 per unit or $12.4 million in cash to purchase 0.7 million in Grove OP Units outstanding at the merger date;

•

Converted
2.1 million Grove OP Units to 1.6 million of the Operating Partnership's OP Units using the conversion ratio of 0.7392 (after
cash-out of fractional units). The value of these converted OP Units totaled $37.2 million;

F-18

•

Assumed
$241.3 million in Grove debt, which included first and second mortgages totaling $203.4 million and Grove's line of credit totaling
$38.0 million;

•

property from subsidized to market rents; and

•

Recorded
acquisition costs of $19.5 million.

All
of the amounts stated above related to these business combinations were based on management's best estimates, which were subject to adjustment within one year of the respective
closing dates.

On
December 12, 2001, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the Company's Declaration of Trust to increase the total number of authorized Common Shares from
350.0 million to 1.0 billion.

On
February 3, 1998, the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3 Registration Statement to register $1 billion of equity securities. The SEC declared this
registration statement effective on

F-19

February 27, 1998. In addition, the Company carried over $272 million related to the registration statement effective on August 4, 1997. As of December 31, 2001,
$1.1 billion remained available for issuance under this registration statement.

The
equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a partnership interest are collectively referred
to as the "Minority Interests—Operating Partnership". As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Minority Interests—Operating Partnership held 23,197,192 and 24,857,502 OP
Units, respectively. As a result, the Minority Interests had a 7.87% and 8.57% interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Assuming conversion of all OP
Units into Common Shares, total Common Shares outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000 would have been 294,818,566 and 290,090,252, respectively.

Net
proceeds from the Company's Common Share and Preferred Share (see definition below) offerings are contributed by the Company to the Operating Partnership in return for an increased
ownership percentage and are treated as capital transactions in the Company's consolidated financial statements. As a result, the net offering proceeds from Common Shares are allocated between
shareholders' equity
and Minority Interests—Operating Partnership to account for the change in their respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

The
declaration of trust of the Company provides that the Company may issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the "Preferred Shares"),
with specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board of Trustees may determine, which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the rights of holders of the
Company's Common Shares.

On
February 23, 2001, the Company entered into a joint venture with an unaffiliated joint venture partner ("JVP"). At closing, the Company sold and/or contributed eleven wholly
owned properties containing 3,011 units valued at $202.5 million to the joint venture encumbered with $20.2 million in mortgage loans obtained on February 16, 2001. An additional
$123.6 million of mortgage loans was obtained by the joint venture. The JVP contributed cash in an amount equal to 75% of the equity in the joint venture, which was then distributed to the
Company. The Company retained a 25% interest in the joint venture along with the right to manage the properties. In accordance with the respective joint venture organization documents, the Company and
the JVP both shall have the right, but not the obligation, to infuse additional cash into the joint venture. There are no other agreements that require the Company or the JVP to infuse cash into the
joint venture. In addition, the Company and the JVP have not guaranteed the mortgage indebtedness of the joint venture. As a result, the Company recognized 75% of the gain on the sales and/or
contributions of property to the joint venture, which totaled approximately $36.2 million. The Company has classified its initial $3.4 million 25% interest in the joint venture (at
carryover basis) as investments in unconsolidated entities and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting.

During
2001, the Company sold its entire interest in two Unconsolidated Properties containing 135 units for approximately $0.7 million.

During
the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company sold fifty properties containing 12,436 units to unaffiliated parties for a total sales price of $626.7 million.
Including the joint venture sales discussed below, the Company recognized a net gain of approximately $198.4 million.

During
2000, the Company entered into three separate joint ventures with an unaffiliated JVP. At closing, the Company sold and/or contributed thirty-four wholly owned
properties containing 7,835 units valued at $473.4 million to the joint ventures encumbered with $341.0 million in mortgage loans. The JVP contributed cash in an amount equal to 75% of
the equity in the joint ventures, which was then distributed to the Company. The Company retained a 25% interest in the joint venture along with the right to manage the properties. In accordance with
the respective joint venture organization documents, the Company and the JVP both shall have the right, but not the obligation, to infuse additional cash into each joint venture. There are no other
agreements that require the Company or the JVP to infuse cash into each joint venture. In addition, the Company and the JVP have not guaranteed the mortgage

F-29

indebtedness of each joint venture. As a result, the Company recognized 75% of the gain on the sales and/or contributions of property to the joint ventures, which totaled approximately
$70.2 million. The Company has classified its initial $10.7 million 25% interest in the joint ventures (at carryover basis) as investments in unconsolidated entities and accounted for
them under the equity method of accounting.

During
2000, the Company also sold its entire interest in three Unconsolidated Properties containing 377 units for approximately $4.6 million.

7. Commitments to Acquire/Dispose of Real Estate

As of December 31, 2001, the Company has not entered into any separate agreements to acquire additional multifamily properties.

As
of December 31, 2001, in addition to the Properties that were subsequently disposed of as discussed in Note 22, the Company entered into separate agreements to dispose
of twenty-eight multifamily properties containing 5,685 units to unaffiliated parties. The Company expects a combined disposition price of approximately $317.2 million.

The
closings of these pending transactions are subject to certain contingencies and conditions, therefore, there can be no assurance that these transactions will be consummated or that
the final terms thereof will not differ in material respects from those summarized in the preceding paragraphs.

8. Investment in Mortgage Notes, Net

In 1995, the Company invested $89 million in various partnership interests and subordinated mortgages collateralized by 21 Properties consisting of 3,896
units. Prior to the consolidation of these Properties, the Company received $61.4 million in cash during 2001 as partial repayment of its investment in these mortgage notes.

On
July 2, 2001, the Company acquired an additional ownership interest in the 21 entities that own the Unconsolidated Properties. As a result of this additional ownership
interest, the Company now has a controlling interest, and as such, consolidates these properties for financial reporting purposes.

The
unamortized balance of the discount on the notes at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was zero and $3.6 million, respectively. During 2001 and 2000, the Company amortized
$2.3 million and $1.2 million,
respectively. This discount was being amortized utilizing the effective yield method based on the expected life of the investment.

The
fair value of the mortgage notes as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was estimated to be approximately zero and $80.8 million, respectively, compared to the Company's
carrying value of zero and $77.2 million, respectively.

the amount funded and outstanding as of December 31, 2001. A total of $718,745 is available for funding under these construction loans.

(4)

EQR
has funded $57.5 million as additional collateral for certain of these loans (see Note 10). All remaining debt is non-recourse to EQR.

Investments
in unconsolidated entities includes the Unconsolidated Properties as well as various uncompleted development joint venture properties. The Company does not consolidate these
entities, as it does not have the ability to exercise unilateral control over the major decisions (such as sale and/or financing/refinancing) regarding these entities. The Company's legal ownership
interests in these entities range from 1.5% to 57.0% at December 31, 2001.

These
investments are accounted for utilizing the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the net equity investment of the Company is reflected on the
consolidated balance sheets and after the project is completed, the consolidated statements of operations include the Company's share of net income or loss from the unconsolidated entity. Prior to the
project being completed, the Company capitalized interest on its equity contribution in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 58,

Capitalization of Interest Cost in
Financial Statements That Include Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method.

During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company capitalized
$19.9 million, $16.2 million, and $6.6 million, respectively, in interest cost related to its unconsolidated joint venture development projects (which reduced interest expense
incurred in the consolidated statements of operations).

The
Company generally contributes between 25% and 30% of the construction cost of the development joint venture projects, with the remaining cost financed through third-party
construction mortgages.

On October 11, 2001, the Company effected a two-for-one split of its Common Shares to shareholders of
record as of September 21, 2001. All per share data and numbers of Common Shares have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Common Share split.

For additional disclosures regarding the employee share options and restricted shares, see Note 15.

15. Share Option and Share Award Plan

Pursuant to the Company's Fifth Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan (the "Fifth Amended Option and Award Plan"), officers, directors, key
employees and consultants of the Company may be offered the opportunity to acquire Common Shares through the grant of share options ("Options") including non-qualified share options
("NQSOs"), incentive share options ("ISOs") and share appreciation rights ("SARs") or may be granted restricted or non-restricted shares. Additionally, under the Fifth Amended Option and
Award Plan, officers and key employees of the Company may be awarded Common Shares, subject to conditions and restrictions as described in the Fifth Amended Option and Award Plan. Finally, certain
executive officers of the Company are subject to the Company's performance based restricted share grant agreement. Options and SARs are sometimes referred to herein as "Awards".

The
Company has reserved 25,000,000 Common Shares for issuance under the Fifth Amended Option and Award Plan. The Options generally are granted at the fair market value of the Company's
Common Shares at the date of grant, vest over a three year period, are exercisable upon vesting and expire ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all Options under the Fifth Amended

F-37

Option and Award Plan shall not be less than the fair market value of the underlying Common Shares at the time the Option is granted. The Fifth Amended Option and Award Plan will terminate at such
time as no further Common Shares are available for issuance upon the exercise of Options and all outstanding Options have expired or been exercised. The Board of Trustees may at any time amend or
terminate the Fifth Amended Option and Award Plan, but termination will not affect Awards previously granted. Any Options, which had vested prior to such a termination, would remain exercisable by the
holder thereof.

As
to the Options that have been granted through December 31, 2001, generally, one-third are exercisable one year after the initial grant, one-third are
exercisable two years following the date such
Options were granted and the remaining one-third are exercisable three years following the date such Options were granted.

As
to the restricted shares that have been awarded through December 31, 2001, these shares generally vest three years from the award date. During the three-year period
of restriction, the employee receives quarterly dividend payments on their shares. If employment is terminated prior to the lapsing of the restriction, the shares are canceled. During the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company issued 470,028 and 520,962 restricted shares. The performance-based awards generally vest over a five-year period.

The
Company has elected to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

("APB No. 25"), in the computation of compensation expense. Under APB No. 25's intrinsic value method, compensation expense is determined by computing
the excess of the market price of the shares over the exercise price on the measurement date. For the Company's share options, the intrinsic value on the measurement date (or grant date) is zero, and
no compensation expense is recognized. For the Company's restricted shares, the Company determines the intrinsic value on the measurement date and accordingly recognizes a compensation expense for
such shares. SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

("Statement No. 123"), requires the Company to disclose pro forma net
income and income per share as if a fair value based accounting method had been used in the computation of compensation expense. The fair value of the options computed under Statement No. 123
would be recognized over the vesting period of the options. The fair value for the Company's options was estimated at the time the options were granted using the Black Scholes option pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 4.43%, 6.22% and 5.84%; dividend yields of 6.17%, 6.83% and 6.89%;
volatility factors of the expected market price of the Company's Common Shares of 0.204, 0.207 and 0.209; and a weighted-average expected life of the options of seven years.

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's Options have characteristics significantly different
from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its Options.

F-38

16. Employee Plans

The Company has established an Employee Share Purchase Plan whereby trustees and employees of the Company may annually acquire up to $100,000 of Common Shares of
the Company. The aggregate number of Common Shares available under the Employee Share Purchase Plan shall not exceed 2,000,000, subject to adjustment by the Board of Trustees. The Common Shares may be

F-39

purchased quarterly at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a share on the last day of such quarter; and (b) the greater of: (i) the closing price for
a share on the first day of such quarter, and (ii) the average closing price for a share for all the business days in the quarter. During 2001, the Company issued 310,261 Common Shares at net
prices that ranged from $21.76 per share to $23.69 per share and raised approximately $6.9 million in connection therewith. During 2000, the Company issued 299,580 Common Shares at net prices
that ranged from $17.06 per share to $20.51 per share and raised approximately $5.4 million in connection therewith. During 1999, the Company issued 295,770 Common Shares at net prices that
ranged from $17.19 per share to $18.36 per share and raised approximately $5.2 million in connection therewith.

The
Company has established a defined contribution plan (the "401(k) Plan") that provides retirement benefits for employees that meet minimum employment criteria. The Company contributes
100% of the first 4% of eligible compensation that a participant contributes to the 401(k) Plan. Participants are vested in the Company's contributions over five years. The Company made contributions
in the amount of $2.3 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, respectively, and expects to make contributions in the amount of approximately
$3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.

17. Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan

On November 3, 1997, the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3 Registration Statement to register 14,000,000 Common Shares pursuant to a
Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (the "DRIP Plan"). The registration statement was declared effective on November 25, 1997.

The
DRIP Plan of the Company provides holders of record and beneficial owners of Common Shares, Preferred Shares, and limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership with a
simple and convenient method of investing cash distributions in additional Common Shares (which is referred to herein as the "Dividend Reinvestment—DRIP Plan"). Common Shares may also be
purchased on a monthly basis with optional cash payments made by participants in the DRIP Plan and interested new investors, not currently shareholders of the Company, at the market price of the
Common Shares less a discount ranging between 0% and 5%, as determined in accordance with the DRIP Plan (which is referred to herein as the "Share Purchase—DRIP Plan").

18. Transactions with Related Parties

Certain officers of the Company purchased Common Shares in prior years which were financed with loans made by the Company at various rates ranging from 6.15% to
7.93% per annum and at one month LIBOR plus 2.0% per annum. Scheduled maturities are at various dates through 2005. The amounts outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000 are $4.0 million
and $4.3 million, respectively.

The
Company also entered into executive compensation, deferred compensation and share distribution agreements with certain officers of the Company that resulted in the Company
recognizing compensation expense of $3.7 million, $0.9 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

In
connection with certain Mergers, the Company agreed to make consulting payments to certain individuals who had been employees of the companies acquired and who became trustees of the
Company subsequent to the applicable merger dates. During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company made payments pursuant to these agreements of $400,000, $400,000 and
$625,000, respectively. The remaining future payments to be made under these agreements as of December 31, 2001 are approximately $167,000.

F-40

The
Company occupies office space at various office buildings that are owned and/or managed by Equity Office Properties Trust, a company of which EQR's chairman of the board is also
chairman of the board. Amounts incurred for such office space for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, were $1,935,013, $1,781,069 and $1,466,569.

Artery
Property Management, Inc., a real estate property management company ("APMI") in which a trustee of the Company is a two-thirds owner and chairman of the board
of directors, provided the Company consulting services with regard to property acquisitions and additional business opportunities. In connection with the acquisition of certain Properties from this
trustee and his affiliates during 1995, the Company made a loan to this trustee and APMI of $15,212,000 evidenced by two notes and secured by 931,090 OP Units. At December 31, 2000, no amounts
were outstanding under these notes and all OP Units were released from their pledges.

During
1999, the Company acquired eight Properties and the related management agreements from affiliates of the aforementioned trustee for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$110.2 million, including the assumption of approximately $44.3 million of mortgage indebtedness. The purchase price also included the issuance of 28,795 Series A Junior
Convertible Preference Units in the Operating Partnership, which have a liquidation value of $100 per unit and are exchangeable for OP Units under
certain circumstances. On June 29, 1999, this trustee received 8,462 of these units with a liquidation value of approximately $0.8 million.

The
Company paid legal fees to a law firm of which one of the Company's trustees is a partner, in the amounts of $1.7 million, $3.6 million and $1.6 million for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

In
addition, the Company has provided acquisition, asset and property management services to certain related entities for properties not owned by the Company. Fees received for providing
such services were approximately $0.8 million, $1.7 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

19. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various environmental laws of Federal and local governments. Compliance by the Company with existing laws
has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. However, the Company cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on its
current Properties or on properties that it may acquire in the future.

The
Company does not believe there is any litigation threatened against the Company other than routine litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business, some of which is
expected to be covered by liability insurance, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

In
regards to the funding of Properties in the development and/or earnout stage and the joint venture agreements with multifamily residential real estate developers, the Company funded a
net total of $174.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. The Company expects to fund approximately $33.5 million in connection with these Properties beyond 2001. In
connection with one joint venture agreement, the Company has an obligation to fund up to an additional $6.5 million to guarantee third party construction financing. As of December 31,
2001, the Company has 22 projects under development with estimated completion dates ranging from March 31, 2002 through December 31, 2003.

F-41

For
one joint venture agreement, the Company's joint venture partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell
its interest in the project to the Company based on such value. If the Company chooses not to purchase the interest,
it must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value. The Company's joint venture partner must exercise this right as to all projects within five years after the receipt of
the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property.

For
the second joint venture agreement, the Company's joint venture partner has the right, at any time following completion of a project, to require the Company to purchase the joint
venture partners' interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price. If the Company and the joint venture partner are unable to agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals. If the
appraised values vary by more than 10%, both the Company and the joint venture partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value.
The Company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead, authorize the joint venture partner to sell the project at or above the agreed-upon value to an unrelated third
party. Five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property, any projects remaining unsold must be purchased by the Company at the
agreed-upon price.

In
connection with the Wellsford Merger, the Company provided a credit enhancement with respect to certain tax-exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a
multifamily development project. As of December 31, 2001, this enhancement was still in effect at a commitment amount of $12.7 million.

During
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, total lease payments incurred, including a portion of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and utilities, aggregated
$4,929,018, $4,074,672 and $3,271,513 respectively.

The
minimum basic aggregate rental commitment under the Company's leases in years following December 31, 2001 is as follows:

20. Asset Impairment

For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded $60.0 million of asset impairment charges related to its Globe furniture rental business.
These charges were the result of a review of the existing intangible and tangible assets reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2001. The impairment loss is reflected
on the statement of operations in total expenses and includes the write-down of the following assets: a) goodwill of approximately $26.0 million; b) rental furniture,
net of approximately $28.6 million; c) property and equipment, net of approximately $4.5 million; and d) other assets of approximately $0.9 million.

F-42

For
the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 the Company recorded approximately $11.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of asset impairment charges related
to its technology investments. These charges were the result of review of the existing investments reflected on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company reviewed the current relative value of each
investment based on existing economic conditions and current events. These impairment losses are reflected on the statement of operations in total expenses and include the write-down of
assets classified as other assets and investments in unconsolidated entities.

21. Reportable Segments

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by senior
management. Senior management decides how resources are allocated and assesses performance on a monthly basis.

The
Company's primary business is owning, managing, and operating multifamily residential properties, which includes the generation of rental and other related income through the leasing
of apartment units to residents. Senior management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment communities on an individual basis, however, each of our apartment communities has similar
economic characteristics, residents, and products and services so they have been aggregated into one reportable segment. The Company's rental real estate segment comprises approximately 95.6%, 96.3%
and 98.2% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company's rental real estate segment comprises approximately 99.8% and 98.7% of total assets
at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The
primary financial measure for the Company's rental real estate segment is net operating income ("NOI"), which represents rental income less: 1) property and maintenance
expense; 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense; and 3) property management expense (all as reflected in the accompanying statements of operations). Current year NOI is compared to
prior year NOI and current year budgeted NOI as a measure of financial performance. NOI from our rental real estate totaled approximately $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and
$1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

During
the acquisition, development and/or disposition of real estate, the NOI return on total capitalized costs is the primary measure of financial performance (capitalization rate) the
Company considers.

The
Company's fee and asset management activity and furniture rental/sales activities are immaterial and do not meet the threshold requirements of a reportable segment as provided for in
SFAS No. 131.

22. Subsequent Events

Subsequent to December 31, 2001 and through February 5, 2002, the Company:

•

disposed
of four Properties consisting of 466 units for approximately $15.5 million;

•

disposed
of its furniture rental business for approximately $30.0 million;

•

repaid
$1.9 million of mortgage debt at/or prior to maturity on two Properties; and

•

repaid
$100.0 million of 9.375% fixed rate public notes at maturity.

23. Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

The following unaudited quarterly data has been prepared on the basis of a December 31 year-end. All per share and weighted average
Common Shares outstanding amounts have been restated as a result of the Company's two-for-one split of its Common Shares. Amounts are in thousands, except for per share
amounts.
