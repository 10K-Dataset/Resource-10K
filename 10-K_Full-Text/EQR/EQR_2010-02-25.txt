EQUITY RESIDENTIAL




PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Equity Residential (“EQR”), a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993,
is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT.

The Company is one of the largest publicly traded real estate companies and is the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily properties
in the United States (based on the aggregate market value of its outstanding Common Shares, the number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned). The Company’s corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the
Company also operates property management offices throughout the United States.

EQR is the general partner of, and as of
December 31, 2009 owned an approximate 95.2% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT
(“UPREIT”) under which all property ownership and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. References to the “Company” include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those
entities owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company, directly or
indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of 495 properties in 23 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 137,007 units. The ownership breakdown includes (table does not include various uncompleted
development properties):

As of
December 31, 2009, the Company has approximately 4,100 employees who provide real estate operations, leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition, development and other support functions.

Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

. These reports are made available at our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with the SEC.

Business Objectives and Operating Strategies

The Company seeks to
maximize current income, capital appreciation of each property and the total return for its shareholders. The Company’s strategy for accomplishing these objectives includes:

•

Leveraging our size and scale in four critical ways:

•

Investing in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets to maximize our total return on an enterprise level;

•

Meeting the needs of our residents by offering a wide array of product choices and a commitment to service;

•

Engaging, retaining and attracting the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed; and

•

Sharing resources and best practices in both property management and across the enterprise.



•

Owning a highly diversified portfolio in our target markets. Target markets are defined by a combination of the following criteria:

•

High barrier-to-entry markets where because of land scarcity or government regulation it is difficult or costly to build new apartment complexes
leading to low supply;

•

Strong economic growth leading to high demand for apartments; and

•

Markets with an attractive quality of life leading to high demand and retention.

•

Giving residents reasons to stay with the Company by providing a range of product choices available in our diversified portfolio and by enhancing their
experience with us through meticulous customer service by our employees and by providing various value-added services.

•

Being open and responsive to changes in the market in order to take advantage of investment opportunities that align with our long-term vision.

Acquisition, Development and Disposition Strategies

The Company anticipates that future property acquisitions, developments and dispositions will occur within the United States. Acquisitions
and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt securities, sales of properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized
borrowings. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”) as consideration for the acquired properties. Such
transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market
opportunities.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, developments and dispositions, the Company generally considers the
following factors:

•

strategically targeted markets;

•

income levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market;

•

employment and household growth and net migration in the relevant market’s population;

•

barriers to entry that would limit competition (zoning laws, building permit availability, supply of undeveloped or developable real estate, local
building costs and construction costs, among other factors);

•

the location, construction quality, age, condition and design of the property;

•

the current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow;

•

the potential for capital appreciation of the property;

•

the terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases;

•

the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located;

•

the occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity (the overall market and submarket);

•

the prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property;

•

the benefits of integration into existing operations;

•

purchase prices and yields of available existing stabilized properties, if any;

•

competition from existing multifamily properties, comparably priced single family homes or rentals, residential properties under development and the
potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area; and

•

opportunistic selling based on demand and price of high quality assets, including condominium conversions.

The Company generally reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve its acquisition, development and rehab
strategies and at times to fund its debt and equity repurchase activities. In addition, when feasible, the Company may structure these transactions as tax-deferred exchanges.

During 2007:

•

January 15 and July 15, commencing January 15, 2008. The Operating Partnership received net proceeds of approximately $640.6 million in connection with this issuance.

•

The Operating Partnership obtained a three-year (subject to two one-year extension options) $500.0 million senior unsecured credit facility (term loan)
which generally incurs a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread dependent upon the current credit rating on the Operating Partnership’s long-term unsecured debt. The Operating Partnership paid $1.1 million in upfront costs, which will be

•

The Company repurchased and retired 27,484,346 of its Common Shares at an average price of $44.62 per share for total consideration of $1.2 billion.

During the first quarter of 2010 through February 19, 2010, the Company has issued approximately
1.1 million Common Shares at an average price of $33.87 per share for total consideration of approximately $35.8 million through the ATM share offering program.

As of the date of this filing, an unlimited amount of debt securities remains available for issuance by the Operating Partnership under a registration statement that became automatically effective upon
filing with the SEC in December 2008 (under SEC regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement automatically expires on December 21, 2011 and does not contain a maximum issuance amount). As of the date of this filing, an unlimited
amount of equity securities remains available for issuance by the Company under a registration statement the SEC declared effective in December 2008 (under SEC regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement automatically expires on
December 15, 2011 and does not contain a maximum issuance amount).

In May 2002, the Company’s shareholders approved
the Company’s 2002 Share Incentive Plan. In January 2003, the Company filed a Form S-8 registration statement to register 23,125,828 Common Shares under this plan. As of January 1, 2010, 22,091,629 shares are the maximum shares issuable
under this plan. See Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Credit
Facilities

The Operating Partnership has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on
February 28, 2012, with the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $500.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. Advances under the
credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest periods plus a spread (currently 0.5%) dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s credit rating or based on bids received from the lending group. EQR has
guaranteed the Operating Partnership’s credit facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, one of the providers of the Operating Partnership’s unsecured revolving credit facility declared bankruptcy. Under the existing terms of the credit facility, the provider’s share is up
to $75.0 million of potential borrowings. As a result, the Operating Partnership’s borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility has, in essence, been permanently reduced to $1.425 billion of potential borrowings. The
obligation to fund by all of the other providers has not changed.



As of December 31, 2009, the amount available on the credit facility was $1.37 billion
(net of $56.7 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed above). As of December 31, 2008, the amount available on the credit facility was $1.29 billion (net of $130.0 million which
was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed above). The Company did not draw on its revolving credit facility and had no balance outstanding at any time during the year ended December 31, 2009.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate was 4.31%.

Competition

All of the Company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties. The
number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the Company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged. The Company may be competing
with other entities that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have more experience than the Company’s managers. In addition, other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to
potential residents of multifamily properties. See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Environmental Considerations

See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

General

The following Risk Factors may contain defined terms that are different from those used in
the other sections of this report. Unless otherwise indicated, when used in this section, the terms “we” and “us” refer to Equity Residential and its subsidiaries, including ERP Operating Limited Partnership. This Item 1A.
includes forward-looking statements. You should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements included in Item 7.

The occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect, possibly in a material manner, our business, financial condition or results of operations, which could
adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest (which we refer to collectively as “Shares”) and limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (“OP
Units”). In this section, we refer to the Shares and the OP Units together as our “securities” and the investors who own Shares and/or OP Units as our “security holders”.

Our Performance and Securities Value are Subject to Risks Associated with the Real Estate Industry

General

Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties. These factors include changes in the national, regional
and local economic climates, local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties, the attractiveness of our properties to residents, competition from other available multifamily
property owners and single family homes and changes in market rental rates. Our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate
taxes, which could increase over time. Sources of labor and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated. Also, the expenses of owning and operating a property are not
necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property.

We May Not Have Sufficient Cash Flows From Operations After Capital Expenditures to Cover Our Distributions

We generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of distributions to our security holders. However, there may be times when we
experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions, which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions and/or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the



difference. Should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature, our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current
distribution levels.

We May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Units as Leases Expire

When our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be able to relet their units. Even if the residents do renew
or we can relet the units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. Because virtually all of our leases are for apartments, they are generally for terms of no more than one year. If we are unable to promptly
renew the leases or relet the units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. Occupancy levels and market rents
may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing, slow or negative employment growth, availability of low
interest mortgages for single family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are beyond the Company’s control. In addition, various state and local municipalities are considering and may continue to consider
rent control legislation which could limit our ability to raise rents. Finally, the federal government is considering and may continue to consider policies which may encourage home ownership, thus increasing competition and possibly limiting our
ability to raise rents. Consequently, our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced.

New Acquisitions and/or Development Projects May Fail to Perform as Expected and Competition for Acquisitions May Result in Increased Prices for Properties

We intend to actively acquire multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate. The Company also develops projects
and currently has several properties under development. We may begin new development activities if conditions warrant. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market
position or to complete a development property. Additionally, we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we
focus our development efforts. This competition may increase prices for multifamily properties. We may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. To the extent that we do
develop more properties if conditions warrant, we expect to do so ourselves in addition to co-investing with our development partners. The total number of development units, costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to
uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local government regulation.

In connection with such government regulation, we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the Americans with Disabilities
Acts, the Fair Housing Act or other federal, state or local requirements. Noncompliance could result in fines, subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance.

Because Real Estate Investments Are Illiquid, We May Not Be Able to Sell Properties When Appropriate

Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or
other conditions. This inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders.

The Value of Investment Securities Could Result In Losses to the Company

From time to time, the Company holds investment securities that have a higher risk profile than the government obligations and bond funds,
money market funds or bank deposits in which we generally invest. On occasion we may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds. There may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment
securities, which may result in losses to the Company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank exceeds the FDIC insurance limit resulting in risk to the Company of loss
of funds if these banks fail.

Changes in Laws and Litigation Risk Could Affect Our Business

We are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate or other federal, state or local taxes.
Consequently, any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders.

We may become involved in legal proceedings, including but not limited to, proceedings related to consumer, employment, development, condominium conversion, tort and commercial legal issues that if
decided adversely to or settled by us, could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations.



Environmental Problems Are Possible and Can Be Costly

Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or
operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property. The owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation
and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants.
Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a
site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site.

Substantially all of our
properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies. While these environmental assessments have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that our
management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future.

Over the past several years, there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging
personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. As some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements, insurance carriers have reacted by excluding mold-related claims
from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates. We have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of
mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property.

We cannot be assured that existing
environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not
otherwise exist as to any of our properties.

Climate Change

To the extent that climate change does occur, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which
may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature, including destruction of our properties, or occur for lengthy
periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.

In addition, developments in
federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties
without a corresponding increase in revenue.

Insurance Policy Deductibles and Exclusions

In order to manage insurance costs, management has gradually increased deductible and self-insured retention amounts. As of December 31,
2009, the Company’s property insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of $250,000 and self-insured retention of $5.0 million per occurrence, subject to a maximum annual aggregate self-insured retention of $7.5 million, with
approximately 80% of any excess losses being covered by insurance. Any earthquake and named windstorm losses are subject to a deductible of 5% of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not subject to the aggregate self-insured
retention. The Company’s general liability and worker’s compensation policies at December 31, 2009 provide for a $2.0 million and $1.0 million per occurrence deductible, respectively. These higher deductible and self-insured retention
amounts do expose the Company to greater potential uninsured losses, but management believes the savings in insurance premium expense justify this potential increased exposure over the long-term. However, the potential impact of climate change and
increased severe weather could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles, particularly for our coastal properties, or a decrease in the availability of coverage, either of which could expose the Company to even greater
uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.

As a result of the terrorist
attacks of September 11, 2001, property insurance carriers created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “all risk” property insurance policies. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was



insured for $500.0 million in terrorism insurance coverage, with a $100,000 deductible. This coverage excludes losses from nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. In the event of a terrorist
attack impacting one or more of our properties, we could lose the revenues from the property, our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses. The Company believes,
however, that the number of properties in and geographic diversity of its portfolio and its terrorism insurance coverage help to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks.

Debt Financing and Preferred Shares Could Adversely Affect Our Performance

General

Please refer to Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, for the Company’s total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of December 31, 2009.

In addition to debt, we have $208.8 million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest with a
weighted average dividend preference of 6.94% per annum as of December 31, 2009. Our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks, including the following:

Disruptions in the Financial Markets Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to Obtain Debt Financing and Impact our Acquisitions and
Dispositions

Dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt
markets, resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us and/or the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. Should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited, or be
available only on unattractive terms, we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments. In addition, it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors
at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt and/or react to changing economic and business conditions. Disruptions in the floating rate tax-exempt bond market (where interest
rates reset weekly) and in the credit market’s perception of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee and provide liquidity for these bonds, have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an
increase in interest rates on these debt obligations. These bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations. While this obligation is in almost all cases non-recourse
to us, this could cause the Company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets. Furthermore, while we believe Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will continue to provide liquidity to our
sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and/or increase borrowing costs and would significantly
reduce our sales of assets. Uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties
that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. Potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the
economy generally and may cause the price of our Common Shares to fluctuate significantly and/or to decline.

Non-Performance by Our Counterparties Could Adversely Affect Our Performance

Although we have not
experienced any material counterparty non-performance, disruptions in financial and credit markets could, among other things, impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations. There are multiple financial
institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility. Should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required, our financial condition could be
adversely affected. Should several of these institutions fail to fund, we could experience significant financial distress. One of the financial institutions, with a commitment of $75.0 million, declared bankruptcy in 2008 and it is unlikely that
they will honor their financial commitment. Our borrowing capacity under the credit facility has in essence been permanently reduced to $1.425 billion.

The Company also has several assets under development with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that have experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could
experience similar distress as economic conditions change. If one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required, the Company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties.
Further, the Company’s joint venture partners may experience financial distress and to the extent they do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures with them, we may be adversely affected. In addition, the Company relies on third
party insurance providers for its property, general liability and worker’s compensation insurance. While there has yet to be any non-performance by these major



insurance providers, should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress, it could negatively impact the Company.

A Significant Downgrade in Our Credit Ratings Could Adversely Affect Our Performance

A significant downgrade in our credit ratings, while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility, would
cause our borrowing costs to increase under the facility and impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt by increasing borrowing costs, or otherwise limit our access to capital. In addition, a downgrade below investment grade would
require us to post cash collateral and/or letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our self-insured property and liability insurance deductibles.

Scheduled Debt Payments Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition

In the future, our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our
securities at expected levels.

We may not be able to refinance existing debt, including joint venture indebtedness (which in
virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity) and, if we can, the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced,
extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions, such as new equity capital, our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt. As a result, certain of our other debt may cross default, we may be forced to
postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties, we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a
property.

If a property we own is mortgaged to secure debt and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments, the holder of the
mortgage could foreclose on the property, resulting in loss of income and asset value. Foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results
of operations.

Please refer to Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

, for the Company’s debt maturity schedule as of December 31, 2009.

Financial Covenants
Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Financial Condition

The mortgages on our properties may contain customary
negative covenants that, among other things, limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage. In addition, our unsecured credit facilities contain certain
restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt. The indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including, among other things,
maintenance of certain financial ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt (including acquisition financing), and to sell all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facilities and indentures are
cross-defaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt. The Company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Some of the properties were financed with tax-exempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions. We have retained
an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties. If these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or
moderate-income residents, or eligible/qualified residents, then our income from these properties may be limited. Generally, we believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with tax-exempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of
income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions.

Our Degree of Leverage Could Limit Our Ability to Obtain
Additional Financing

Our consolidated debt-to-total market capitalization ratio was 48.1% as of December 31,
2009. Our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders. For example, the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
development or other general corporate purposes, making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general.



Rising Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow

Advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest periods, plus a spread dependent
upon the Operating Partnership’s credit rating, or based upon bids received from the lending group. Certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also, from time to time, bear interest at floating rates. We may also
borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt.
Accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders.

Derivatives and Hedging Activity Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow

In the normal course of business, we use derivatives to hedge our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments, including hedging for future debt issuances. There can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the
desired beneficial impact. These arrangements, which can include a number of counterparties, may expose us to additional risks, including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts, and may involve extensive costs, such as
transaction fees or breakage costs, if we terminate them. No strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.

We Depend on Our Key Personnel

We depend on the efforts of the Chairman of
our Board of Trustees, Samuel Zell, and our executive officers, particularly David J. Neithercut, our President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). If they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us, our operations could be
temporarily adversely affected. Mr. Zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the Company.

Control and Influence by Significant Shareholders Could Be Exercised in a Manner Adverse to Other Shareholders

The consent of certain affiliates of Mr. Zell is required for certain amendments to the Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”). As a result of
their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the Partnership Agreement, the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the Company. Although to the Company’s knowledge these security holders have not agreed to
act together on any matter, they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the Company’s affairs if they were to act together in the future. This influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with
the interests of other security holders. For additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees, including Mr. Zell, and our executive officers, see the Company’s definitive proxy statement.

Shareholders’ Ability to Effect Changes in Control of the Company is Limited

Provisions of Our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws Could Inhibit Changes in Control

Certain provisions of our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transactions that
could provide the security holders with a premium over the then-prevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders. This includes the 5% Ownership Limit described below. While our
existing preferred shares do not have these provisions, any future series of preferred shares may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our
security holders. In 2008, we adopted amendments to our Bylaws to expand the information required to be provided by any security holder, or persons acting in concert with such security holder, who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting
of shareholders, including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities. These amendments could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in
the interest of our security holders.

We Have a Share Ownership Limit for REIT Tax Purposes

To remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding Shares may be owned, directly or
indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year. To facilitate maintenance of our REIT qualification, our Declaration of Trust, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of
more than 5% of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding



class of common or preferred shares. We refer to this restriction as the “Ownership Limit.” Absent any exemption or waiver granted by our Board of Trustees, securities acquired or held
in violation of the Ownership Limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate. A transfer of Shares may be void
if it causes a person to violate the Ownership Limit. The Ownership Limit could delay or prevent a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price
for their Shares. To reduce the ability of the Board to use the Ownership Limit as an anti-takeover device, in 2004 the Company amended the Ownership Limit to require, rather than permit, the Board to grant a waiver of the Ownership Limit if the
individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the Company’s status as a REIT.

Our Preferred Shares May Affect Changes in Control

Our Declaration of Trust authorizes the Board of
Trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares, and to establish the preferences and rights (including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares) of any preferred shares issued. The Board of Trustees may use its powers
to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders.

Inapplicability of Maryland Law Limiting Certain Changes in Control

Certain provisions of Maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” (including certain
issuances of equity securities) with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities, or with an affiliate who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the
beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding voting securities (an “Interested Shareholder”), or with an affiliate of an Interested Shareholder. These prohibitions last for five years after
the most recent date on which the Interested Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder. After the five-year period, a business combination with an Interested Shareholder must be approved by two super-majority shareholder votes unless, among other
conditions, holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the Interested Shareholder for its common shares. As permitted by Maryland law,
however, the Board of Trustees of the Company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving Mr. Zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them. Consequently, the five-year
prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us and/or any of them. Such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders.

Our Success as a REIT Is Dependent on Compliance with Federal Income Tax Requirements

Our Failure to Qualify as a REIT Would Have Serious Adverse Consequences to Our Security Holders

We believe that we have qualified for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended December 31, 1992
based, in part, upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions. We plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however,
are highly technical and complex. We cannot, therefore, guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a REIT. The determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our
control. For example, to qualify as a REIT, our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. We are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90%
of our REIT taxable income excluding capital gains. The fact that we hold our assets through ERP Operating Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake
could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a REIT. We do
not believe, however, that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our REIT status. In addition, Congress and the IRS have recently liberalized the REIT qualification rules to permit REITs in certain circumstances to pay a monetary
penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose REIT status.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to
federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified from taxation as a REIT for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT.
If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would have to pay significant income taxes. We, therefore, would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value
of our securities. In



addition, we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local
taxes on our income and property. In addition, our corporate housing business and condominium conversion business, which are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, generally will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate
rates to the extent they have taxable income.

We Could Be Disqualified as a REIT or Have to Pay Taxes if Our Merger
Partners Did Not Qualify as REITs

If any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a REIT throughout the
duration of their existence, then they might have had undistributed “C corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us. If that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the
year in which the merger took place, we might not qualify as a REIT. We believe based, in part, upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations, among other things, that each
of our prior merger partners qualified as a REIT and that, in any event, none of them had any undistributed “C corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us. If any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as
a REIT, an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us. We would be liable for the tax on such gain. We also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at
the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger.

Compliance with REIT Distribution Requirements May Affect Our Financial Condition

Distribution
Requirements May Increase the Indebtedness of the Company

We may be required from time to time, under certain
circumstances, to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received. In such event, or upon our repayment of principal on debt, we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution
requirements of a REIT. Accordingly, we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements.

Tax Elections Regarding Distributions May Impact Future Liquidity of the Company

During 2008 and 2009, we did make, and under certain circumstances may consider making again in the future, a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current
year. This election, which is provided for in the REIT tax code, may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year. However, this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our
dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the REIT distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability.

Federal Income Tax Considerations

General

The following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares. It is not exhaustive of all
possible tax considerations. For example, it does not give a detailed discussion of any state, local or foreign tax considerations. The following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in
light of their particular circumstances. Moreover, it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws, such as insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial
institutions or broker-dealers, foreign corporations, persons who are not citizens or residents of the United States and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flow-through entity for federal income tax purposes.

The specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated
with the purchase, ownership and disposition of common shares. Therefore, it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the
shareholder’s personal tax situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

The information in this section is based on the current Internal Revenue Code, current, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations, the legislative history of the Internal Revenue Code, current
administrative



interpretations and practices of the Internal Revenue Service, including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings, which are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service,
and existing court decisions. Future legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law. Any change could apply retroactively. Thus, it is
possible that the Internal Revenue Service could challenge the statements in this discussion, which do not bind the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and that a court could agree with the Internal Revenue Service.

Our Taxation

We elected REIT status beginning with the year that ended December 31, 1992. In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gain
that we distribute to our shareholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations, which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount
they receive. We elected taxable REIT subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries, primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities. As a result, we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities
performed by our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

We will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our REIT
taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax if we do not satisfy specific REIT distribution requirements. We could also be subject to the “alternative minimum
tax” on our items of tax preference. In addition, any net income from “prohibited transactions” (i.e., dispositions of property, other than property held by a taxable REIT subsidiary, held primarily for sale to customers in the
ordinary course of business) will be subject to a 100% tax. We could also be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable REIT subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the
Internal Revenue Service. If we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (described below) but have maintained our qualification as a REIT because we satisfied certain other requirements, we will still generally be
subject to a 100% penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure. If we fail to satisfy any of the REIT asset tests (described below) by more than a

de minimis

amount, due to reasonable
cause, and we nonetheless maintain our REIT qualification because of specified cure provisions, we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the
non-qualifying assets. If we fail to satisfy any provision of the Internal Revenue Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT (other than a violation of the REIT gross income or asset tests described below) and the violation is due
to reasonable cause, we may retain our REIT qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. Moreover, we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently
contemplate.

We believe that we have qualified as a REIT for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992. We also believe
that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a REIT. However, given the complexity of the REIT qualification requirements, we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations
have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the Internal Revenue Code for a particular year.

If we fail to qualify
for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply, we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum
tax.” As a result, our failure to qualify as a REIT would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders. Unless entitled to statutory relief, we would not be able to re-elect to be taxed as a REIT until our
fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification. It is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief.

Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. We are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other
results. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT.

Ownership of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries by Us

. The Internal Revenue Code provides that REITs may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of “taxable REIT
subsidiaries” or “TRSs”, which are corporations subject to tax as a regular “C” corporation that have elected, jointly with a REIT, to be a TRS. Generally, a taxable REIT subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be
owned by a REIT and can perform impermissible tenant services (discussed below), which would otherwise taint our rental income under the REIT income tests. However, the REIT will be obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that we
receive or on certain expenses deducted by our TRSs if the economic arrangements between us, our tenants and the TRS are not



comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties. A TRS may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100% federal income tax liability imposed on REITs.
Income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land, the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units.

TRSs pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates. The amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services
income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount. The TRSs will attempt to reduce, if possible, the amount of these taxes, but we cannot guarantee whether, or the
extent to which, measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful. To the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes, less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders.

Share Ownership Test and Organizational Requirement

. In order to qualify as a REIT, our shares of beneficial interest must be
held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. Also, not more than 50% in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned
directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year. In addition, we must meet certain other organizational requirements, including, but not limited to, that
(i) the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and (ii) we are managed by one or more trustees. We believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will
continue to do so in the future. In order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50% share ownership test discussed above, we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further
concentration of share ownership. However, such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements, and thereby failing to qualify as a REIT.

Gross Income Tests

. To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income tests:

(1)

At least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from rents from real property, investments in real estate and/or real
estate mortgages, dividends paid by another REIT and from some types of temporary investments (excluding certain hedging income).

(2)

At least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from any combination of income qualifying under the 75% test and dividends, non-real estate
mortgage interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities (excluding certain hedging income).

To qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests, rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident. Also, the rent attributable
to personal property must not exceed 15% of the total rent. We may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the
rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services”. If such services are impermissible, then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount, or are provided through an independent
contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements, or through a taxable REIT subsidiary. We believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real
property and not otherwise considered impermissible, or, if considered impermissible services, will meet the

de minimis

test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable REIT subsidiary. However, we cannot provide any assurance
that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with these positions.

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income
tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. In this case, a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above. Generally,
it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply, we will not qualify as a REIT.

Asset Tests

. In general, at the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our
assets:

(1)

At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets (which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts)
and certain cash related items;

(2)

Not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75% asset class;

(3)

Except for securities included in item 1 above, equity investments in other REITs, qualified REIT subsidiaries (i.e., corporations owned 100% by a REIT
that are not TRSs or REITs), or taxable REIT subsidiaries: (a) the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of



our total assets and (b) we may not own securities representing more than 10% of the voting power or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer; and

(4)

Not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries.

The 10% value test described in clause (3) (b) above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a
safe harbor under the Code. Under the safe harbor, the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10% value test: (i) straight debt securities, (ii) any loan of an individual or an estate,
(iii) certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property, (iv) any obligation to pay rents from real property, (v) any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof, foreign government or Puerto Rico only if
the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity, or (vi) any security issued by a REIT. The timing and payment of interest or principal
on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that (A) such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity, not considering a

de minimis

change which does not exceed the greater of


/


of 1% or 5% of the annual yield to maturity or we own
$1,000,000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer’s debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or (B) the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the
contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt. If we hold indebtedness from any issuer, including a REIT, the indebtedness will be subject to, and may cause a violation of, the asset tests,
unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor. We currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as REITs for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded. If
any such entity were to fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not meet the 10% voting stock limitation and the 10% value limitation and we would, unless certain relief provisions applied, fail to qualify as a REIT. We believe that we and each of the
REITs we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for REIT qualification. However, we cannot provide any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with our determinations.

If we fail to satisfy the 5% or 10% asset tests described above after a 30-day cure period provided in the Internal Revenue Code, we will be
deemed to have met such tests if the value of our non-qualifying assets is

de minimis

(i.e., does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or $10,000,000) and we dispose of the
non-qualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered. For violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the

de minimis

exception described above, we may avoid disqualification as a REIT under any of the asset tests, after the 30-day cure period, by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period, paying a tax equal to the greater
of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the Internal Revenue Service. If we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions, or if we
fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.

Annual Distribution
Requirements

. To qualify as a REIT, we are generally required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90% of our REIT taxable income. These distributions must be
paid either in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is
made. We intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our REIT taxable income,
as adjusted, we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates. We will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal
income tax was paid, if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of: (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year; (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for the year; and (3) any undistributed taxable
income from prior taxable years. A REIT may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains. In that case, a REIT may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of
the undistributed net capital gains in income as long-term capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the REIT. For purposes of the 4% excise tax described above, any retained amounts would be treated as having been
distributed.

Ownership of Partnership Interests By Us

. As a result of our ownership of the Operating Partnership, we
will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the Operating Partnership, respectively, for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, including its share of assets and items of income of any
subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies.



State and Local Taxes

. We may be subject to state or local taxation in various
jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business or reside. Generally REITs have seen increases in state and local taxes in recent years. Our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed
above. Consequently, prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares.

Taxation of Domestic Shareholders Subject to U.S. Tax

General

. If
we qualify as a REIT, distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares, other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable REIT subsidiaries, will be treated as ordinary income
to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits. These distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend
income” under the Internal Revenue Code, meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to
shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements. In determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits, we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares. The portion
of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a TRS, will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to REIT shareholders and are currently (for the 2010 tax year) eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to
our non-corporate shareholders.

To the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our
earnings and profits, such distributions will be considered a return of capital. Such distributions will be treated as a tax-free distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so
treated. To the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis, such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares. Shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of
our net operating losses or capital losses.

Dividends declared by a REIT in October, November, or December are deemed to have
been paid by the REIT and received by its shareholders on December 31 of that year, so long as the dividends are actually paid during January of the following year. However, this treatment only applies to the extent of the REIT’s earnings
and profits existing on December 31. To the extent the shareholder distribution paid in January exceeds available earnings and profits as of December 31, the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year
paid. As such, for tax reporting purposes, January distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years.

Distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year. This treatment applies only to
the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year. It applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares. Despite this general rule, corporate
shareholders may be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income.

Generally, we will
classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a 15% rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured Section 1250 gain distribution. A 15% rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic
shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 15% (which 15% rate is currently scheduled to increase to 20% for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2011). An unrecaptured Section 1250 gain
distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25%.

If, for any taxable year, we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest, then the portion of the capital gains
dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares
for the year. The denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest.

We may elect to retain (rather than distribute as is generally required) net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain. If we make this election, shareholders must include in
income, as long-term capital gain, their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain. Shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains. Accordingly, they will receive a tax
credit or refund for the amount. Shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital



gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid. Our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately.

In general, a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in
an amount equal to the difference between:

(a)

the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition; and

(b)

the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares.

The gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset. Generally, the capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the common shares were held
for more than one year.

In general, a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six
months or less, determined after applying certain holding period rules, will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as long-term capital gains. For shareholders who are
individuals, trusts and estates, the long-term capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable long-term capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated.

Taxation of Domestic Tax-Exempt Shareholders

Most tax-exempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income, which is often referred to as UBTI. Unless a tax-exempt shareholder
holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business, distributions to the shareholder should not constitute UBTI. Similarly, if a tax-exempt shareholder sells common shares, the income from
the sale should not constitute UBTI unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business.

However, for tax-exempt shareholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified group legal services plans, income from owning
or selling common shares will constitute UBTI unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares. These shareholders should consult their
own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.

In
addition, certain pension trusts that own more than 10% of a “pension-held REIT” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the REIT as UBTI. We have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pension-held REIT
for purposes of this rule.

Taxation of Foreign Shareholders

The following is a discussion of certain anticipated United States federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common
shares applicable to a foreign shareholder. For purposes of this discussion, a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than:

(a)

a citizen or resident of the United States;

(b)

a corporation or partnership created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof; or

(c)

an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its source.

Distributions by Us

. Distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or
exchanges by us of United States real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits. These distributions ordinarily
will be subject to withholding of United States federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30% rate, or a lower treaty rate, unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a United States trade
or business. Please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from REITs. Dividends that are effectively connected with



a United States trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates, and are generally not subject to withholding. Certification and disclosure requirements must be
satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption. A foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or a lower treaty rate.

We expect to withhold United States income tax at the rate of 30% on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless:

(a)

a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder files an IRS Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income.

If such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the
extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares. Instead, the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares. To the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of
the common shares, it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common shares. The tax treatment of this gain is described below.

We intend to withhold at a rate of 30%, or a lower applicable treaty rate, on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution. In such event, a foreign shareholder may
seek a refund of the withheld amount from the IRS if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in excess of our earnings and profits, and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s United States tax liability
with respect to the distribution.

Any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is “regularly
traded” on an established securities market, will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above, if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the
distribution. Foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report such distributions received from us on U.S. federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including any capital
gain dividends, will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty), as described above. In addition, the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions.

Distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends, other than those
arising from the disposition of a United States real property interest, generally will not be subject to United States federal income taxation unless:

(a)

the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s United States trade or business, in which case the foreign shareholder
will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders, except that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax, as discussed above; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a “tax
home” in the United States, in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual’s capital gains.

Under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, which is known as FIRPTA, distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of United States real property
interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a United States trade or business. This rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend.
Accordingly, foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to U.S. shareholders, subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. In addition, a foreign
corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above, as well as U.S. federal income tax return filing requirements. We are required to withhold 35% of these distributions. The withheld amount can be credited against the
foreign shareholder’s United States federal income tax liability.

Although the law is not entirely clear on the matter,
it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by U.S. shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends.
Under that approach, foreign



shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their United States federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains. In
addition, if timely requested, foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the IRS a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual United States federal income tax liability.

Foreign Shareholders’ Sales of Common Shares

. Gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common
shares generally will not be subject to United States taxation unless the shares constitute a “United States real property interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA. The common shares will not constitute a United States real property interest
so long as we are a domestically controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders. We believe
that we are a domestically controlled REIT. Therefore, we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under FIRPTA. However, because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded, we cannot guarantee that we will
continue to be a domestically controlled REIT. In any event, gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to FIRPTA will be subject to U.S. tax, if either:

(a)

the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s United States trade or business, in which case the foreign shareholder
will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the
United States, in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual’s capital gains.

Even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled REIT, gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to United States
taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a United States real property interest if:

(a)

the class or series of shares being sold is “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable IRS regulations, on an established securities market such as the
New York Stock Exchange; and

(b)

the selling foreign shareholder owned 5% or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout the five-year period ending on the date
of the sale or exchange.

If gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under
FIRPTA, the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular United States income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable U.S. shareholder, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax, a special alternative minimum tax in
the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations. The purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 10% of the purchase price.

Information Reporting Requirement and Backup Withholding

We will report to our domestic shareholders and the Internal Revenue Service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and
the amount of tax withheld, if any. Under certain circumstances, domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the Internal
Revenue Service. Backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and tax-exempt organizations. Domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their
qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will
be allowed as a credit against such person’s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

Properties

As of
December 31, 2009, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of 495 properties in 23 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 137,007 units. The Company’s properties
are summarized by building type in the following table:

The Company’s properties are summarized by ownership type in the following table:

The following table sets forth certain information by
market relating to the Company’s properties at December 31, 2009:

PORTFOLIO SUMMARY



(1)

Average rental rate is defined as total rental revenues divided by the weighted average occupied units for the month of December 2009.

The Company’s properties had an average occupancy of approximately 93.9% at December 31, 2009. Certain of the Company’s
properties are encumbered by mortgages and additional detail can be found on Schedule III – Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation. Resident leases are generally for twelve months in length and can require security deposits. The garden-style
properties are generally defined as properties with two and/or three story buildings while the mid-rise/high-rise are defined as properties with greater than three story buildings. These two property types typically provide residents with amenities,
which may include a clubhouse, swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television access. Certain of these properties offer additional amenities such as saunas, whirlpools, spas, sports courts and exercise rooms or other amenities. The military
housing properties are defined as those properties located on military bases.

The distribution of the properties throughout
the United States reflects the Company’s belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio from regional and economic influences. At the same time, the Company has sought to create clusters of properties within each of its
primary markets in order to achieve economies of scale in management and operation. The Company may nevertheless acquire additional multifamily properties located anywhere in the United States.

The properties currently in various stages of development at December 31, 2009 are included in the following table:



Consolidated Development Projects as of December 31, 2009

(Amounts in thousands except for project and unit amounts)

(1)

Total capital cost represents estimated development cost for projects under development and/or developed and all capitalized costs incurred to date plus any estimates
of costs remaining to be funded for all projects, all in accordance with GAAP.

(2)

Debt is primarily tax-exempt bonds that are entirely outstanding with $47.4 million held in escrow by the lender and released as draw requests are made. This escrowed
amount is classified as “Deposits – restricted” in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009.

(3)

Of the approximately $139.9 million of capital cost remaining to be funded at December 31, 2009 for projects under development, $102.1 million will be funded by
fully committed third party bank loans and the remaining $37.8 million will be funded by cash on hand.

(4)

Properties included here are substantially complete. However, they may still require additional exterior and interior work for all units to be available for leasing.

(5)

Third Square – Both the percentage leased and percentage occupied reflect the full 482 units included in phases I and II. Phase I is 96% leased and 94% occupied.
Phase II is 58% leased and 53% occupied.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

The
Company is party to a housing discrimination lawsuit brought by a non-profit civil rights organization in April 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The suit alleges that the Company designed and built approximately 300 of
its properties in violation of the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act and Americans With Disabilities Act. The suit seeks actual and punitive damages, injunctive relief (including modification of non-compliant properties), costs and
attorneys’ fees. The Company believes it has a number of viable defenses, including that a majority of the named properties were completed before the operative dates of the statutes in question and/or were not designed or built by the Company.
Accordingly, the Company is defending the suit vigorously. Due to the pendency of the Company’s defenses and the uncertainty of many other critical factual and legal issues, it is not possible to determine or predict the outcome of the suit and
as a result, no amounts have been accrued at December, 31, 2009. While no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe that the suit, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company does not believe there is any other litigation pending or threatened against it that, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably may be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Common Share Market Prices and Dividends

The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, the high, low and closing sales prices for and the distributions declared on the Company’s Common Shares, which trade on the New York Stock
Exchange under the trading symbol EQR.

The number of record
holders of Common Shares at February 19, 2010 was approximately 3,400. The number of outstanding Common Shares as of February 19, 2010 was 281,884,878.

Unregistered Common Shares Issued in the Quarter Ended December 31, 2009

During the quarter ended December 31, 2009, the Company issued 234,973 Common Shares in exchange for 234,973 OP Units held by various limited partners of the Operating Partnership. OP Units are
generally exchangeable into Common Shares of EQR on a one-for-one basis or, at the option of the Operating Partnership, the cash equivalent thereof, at any time one year after the date of issuance. Some of these shares were issued in reliance on
exemptions from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as these were transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. In light of the manner of
the sale and information obtained by the Company from the limited partners in connection with these transactions, the Company believes it may rely on these exemptions.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

The following table provides
information as of December 31, 2009 with respect to the Company’s Common Shares that may be issued under its existing equity compensation plans.

(1)

The amounts shown in columns (a) and (b) of the above table do not include 954,366 outstanding Common Shares (all of which are restricted and
subject to vesting requirements) that were granted under the Company’s Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan, as amended (the “1993



Plan”) and the Company’s 2002 Share Incentive Plan, as restated (the “2002 Plan”) and outstanding Common Shares that have been purchased by employees and trustees under the
Company’s ESPP.

(2)

Includes 6,295,992 Common Shares that may be issued under the 2002 Plan, of which only 25% may be in the form of restricted shares, and 3,561,333 Common Shares that may
be sold to employees and trustees under the ESPP.

The aggregate number of securities available for issuance
(inclusive of restricted shares previously granted and outstanding and shares underlying outstanding options) under the 2002 Plan equals 7.5% of the Company’s outstanding Common Shares, calculated on a fully diluted basis, determined annually
on the first day of each calendar year. On January 1, 2010, this amount equaled 22,091,629, of which 6,295,992 shares were available for future issuance. No awards may be granted under the 2002 Plan after February 20, 2012.

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth selected financial and operating information on a historical basis for the Company. The following information should be read in conjunction with all of the financial statements and notes thereto included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The historical operating and balance sheet data have been derived from the historical financial statements of the Company. All amounts have also been restated in accordance with the guidance on discontinued operations,
noncontrolling interests and convertible debt. Certain capitalized terms as used herein are defined in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

(Financial information in thousands except for per share and property data)

(1)

The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from operations (“FFO”) (April 2002 White
Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss
on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. FFO available to Common
Shares and Units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the



“Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership”. Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR
Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. See Item 7 for a reconciliation of net income to FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units.

(2)

The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real
estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of
identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as
compared to different companies. FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO and FFO
available to Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as measures of liquidity. The
Company’s calculation of FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be
comparable to such other real estate companies.

(3)

Effective January 1, 2009, companies are required to retrospectively expense certain implied costs of the option value related to convertible debt. As a result,
net income, net income available to Common Shares and FFO available to Common Shares and Units – basic have all been reduced by approximately $10.6 million, $13.3 million, $10.1 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in connection with
the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Due to the Company’s ability to control the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning interests in the Partially Owned Properties – Unconsolidated and
certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as
defined elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Forward-Looking
Statements

Forward-looking statements in this Item 7 as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are
intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions made by management. While the
Company’s management believes the assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, such information is inherently subject to uncertainties and may involve certain risks, which could cause actual results, performance or
achievements of the Company to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many of these uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and beyond
management’s control. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, results or events. The forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date hereof and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or
supplement these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to the following:

•

We intend to actively acquire multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate. The Company also develops projects and
currently has several properties under development. We may begin new development activities if conditions warrant. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or
to complete a development property. Additionally, we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our
development efforts. This competition may increase prices for multifamily properties. We may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. To the extent that we do develop more
properties if conditions warrant, we expect to do so ourselves in addition to co-investing with our development partners. The total number of development units, costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising
from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local government regulation;

•

Debt financing and other capital required by the Company may not be available or may only be available on adverse terms;

•

Labor and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated;



•

Occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new
construction and excess inventory of multifamily housing and single family housing, slow or negative employment growth, availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which
are beyond the Company’s control; and

•

Additional factors as discussed in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly those under “Item 1A.

Risk Factors

”.

Forward-looking statements and related uncertainties are also included in Notes 2, 5, 11 and 18 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Overview

Equity Residential (“EQR”), a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500
company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT.

The Company is one of the largest publicly traded real estate companies and is the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily properties
in the United States (based on the aggregate market value of its outstanding Common Shares, the number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned). The Company’s corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the
Company also operates property management offices throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has approximately 4,100 employees who provide real estate operations, leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition,
disposition, development and other support functions.

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2009 owned
an approximate 95.2% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”) under which all
property ownership and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. References to the “Company” include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled by the
Operating Partnership and/or EQR.

Business Objectives and Operating Strategies

The Company seeks to maximize current income, capital appreciation of each property and the total return for its shareholders. The
Company’s strategy for accomplishing these objectives includes:

•

Leveraging our size and scale in four critical ways:

•

Investing in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets to maximize our total return on an enterprise level;

•

Meeting the needs of our residents by offering a wide array of product choices and a commitment to service;

•

Engaging, retaining and attracting the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed; and

•

Sharing resources and best practices in both property management and across the enterprise.

•

Owning a highly diversified portfolio in our target markets. Target markets are defined by a combination of the following criteria:

•

High barrier-to-entry markets where because of land scarcity or government regulation it is difficult or costly to build new apartment complexes
leading to low supply;

•

Strong economic growth leading to high demand for apartments; and

•

Markets with an attractive quality of life leading to high demand and retention.

•

Giving residents reasons to stay with the Company by providing a range of product choices available in our diversified portfolio and by enhancing their
experience with us through meticulous customer service by our employees and by providing various value-added services.

•

Being open and responsive to changes in the market in order to take advantage of investment opportunities that align with our long-term vision.



Acquisition, Development and Disposition Strategies

The Company anticipates that future property acquisitions, developments and dispositions will occur within the United States. Acquisitions
and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt securities, sales of properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized
borrowings. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”) as consideration for the acquired properties. Such
transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market
opportunities.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, developments and dispositions, the Company generally considers the
following factors:

•

strategically targeted markets;

•

income levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market;

•

employment and household growth and net migration in the relevant market’s population;

•

barriers to entry that would limit competition (zoning laws, building permit availability, supply of undeveloped or developable real estate, local
building costs and construction costs, among other factors);

•

the location, construction quality, age, condition and design of the property;

•

the current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow;

•

the potential for capital appreciation of the property;

•

the terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases;

•

the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located;

•

the occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity (the overall market and submarket);

•

the prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property;

•

the benefits of integration into existing operations;

•

purchase prices and yields of available existing stabilized properties, if any;

•

competition from existing multifamily properties, comparably priced single family homes or rentals, residential properties under development and the
potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area; and

•

opportunistic selling based on demand and price of high quality assets, including condominium conversions.

The Company generally reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve its acquisition, development and rehab
strategies and at times to fund its debt maturities and debt and equity repurchase activities. In addition, when feasible, the Company may structure these transactions as tax-deferred exchanges.

Current Environment

The slowdown in the economy, which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued into 2009, coupled with continued job losses and/or lack of job growth leads us to be cautious regarding expected performance for 2010. Since the
fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2009, our revenue has declined in comparison to the prior year in most of our major markets as the economic slowdown continues to impact existing and prospective residents. Markets
with little employment loss have performed better than markets with larger employment issues. Although all of our markets experienced job losses in 2009, the pace of those losses appears to have begun to slow. While the job market is likely to
remain weak in 2010, beginning late in the fourth quarter of 2009, household spending was reported to have increased and the deterioration in the labor market showed signs of abating. Despite a generally improving credit environment and better
general economic conditions, the Company may continue to experience a period of declining revenues, which would adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. The vast majority of our leases are for terms of 12 months or less. As a
result, we quickly feel the impact of an economic downturn which limits our ability to raise rents or causes us to lower rents on turnover units and lease renewals. During late 2008 and early 2009, our rental rates declined on average between 9% and
10% for new residents but on average less than 1% for renewing residents. Rental rates have not declined, on average, since the first quarter of 2009 and began to show improvement in the latter part of the year. However, since our rental rates
increased during most of 2008, our quarter over quarter revenue declines worsened each quarter in 2009 as compared to 2008. Quarter over quarter revenue declines are expected to continue in 2010 (although they should be less negative in 2010 vs.
2009 than when comparing 2009 vs. 2008). Given the roll-down in lease rates that occurred throughout 2009, the full year comparison to 2010 will continue to show declining revenue even if quarter over quarter revenue improvement begins



in the second half of 2010. Our revenues are also impacted by our resident turnover rates, which have generally declined, and our occupancy rates, which began to rise in the fourth quarter of
2009. After three consecutive years of excellent expense control (same store expenses declined 0.1% between 2009 and 2008 and grew 2.2% between 2008 and 2007 and 2.1% between 2007 and 2006), the Company anticipates that 2010 same store expenses will
increase between 1.0% and 2.0% primarily due to cost pressures from non-controllable areas such as real estate taxes and utilities. The combination of expected declines in revenues and moderately increasing expense levels will have a negative impact
on the Company’s results of operations for 2010.

The strained credit environment has negatively impacted the
availability and pricing of debt capital. However, during this time, the multifamily residential sector has benefited from the continued liquidity provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A vast majority of the properties we sold in 2008 and 2009
were financed for the purchaser by one of these agencies. Furthermore, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provided us with approximately $1.6 billion of secured mortgage financing in 2008 and $500.0 million in 2009 at attractive rates when compared to other
sources of credit at that time. While unsecured credit markets improved in the latter part of 2009 and the Company currently has unsecured lending options available to it at attractive rates, should the agencies discontinue providing liquidity to
our sector, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and/or increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets.

In response to the recession and liquidity issues prevalent in the debt markets, we took a number of steps to better position
ourselves. In early 2008, we began pre-funding our maturing debt obligations with approximately $1.6 billion in secured mortgage financing obtained from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We also significantly reduced our acquisition activity. During the
second half of 2008 and through the fourth quarter of 2009, we only acquired four properties (one of which was the buyout of our partner in an unconsolidated asset) and a long-term leasehold interest in a land parcel while we continued selling
non-core assets. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company sold 60 properties consisting of 12,489 units for $1.0 billion, as well as 62 condominium units for $12.0 million. The Company acquired two properties consisting of 566 units
for $145.0 million, one previously unconsolidated property consisting of 250 units for $18.5 million from its institutional joint venture partner and a long-term leasehold interest in a land parcel for $11.5 million during the year ended
December 31, 2009. While we believe these sales of non-core assets better positions us for future success, they have resulted and will continue to result in dilution, particularly when the net sales proceeds are initially not reinvested in
activities generating equivalent income such as acquisition of rental properties or repayment of debt. Additionally, we have significantly reduced our development activities, starting only two new projects in the first half of 2008 and none in the
second half of the year or during 2009. We also reduced the number of planned development projects we will undertake in the future and took a $116.4 million impairment charge in 2008 to reduce the value of five assets that we no longer plan on
pursuing. We took an additional $11.1 million impairment charge in 2009 to reduce the value of one asset. The Company reduced its quarterly common share dividend beginning with the dividend for the third quarter of 2009, from $0.4825 per share (an
annual rate of $1.93 per share) to $0.3375 per share (an annual rate of $1.35 per share).

The credit environment improved
throughout mid and late 2009 and we currently have access to multiple sources of capital allowing us a less cautious posture with respect to pre-funding our maturing debt obligations. As a result of the improved credit environment, in late 2009, we
utilized $366.2 million of cash on hand to repurchase certain unsecured notes and convertible notes in public tender offers. Concurrently, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, we began to see an increase in the availability of attractive
acquisition opportunities. We expect to revert from a net seller of assets during 2009 to a net buyer of assets in 2010. During 2010, we expect that property dispositions will be more a funding source for attractive acquisition opportunities that we
may identify than for providing needed capital to protect the Company’s financial position. Our access to capital and our ability to execute large, complex transactions should be competitive advantages in 2010. However, should a double-dip
recession materialize or credit/equity markets deteriorate, we may seek to take steps similar to what we did in 2008 and early 2009 to increase liquidity and better position ourselves.

Our specific current expectations regarding our results for 2010 and certain items that will affect them are set forth under Results of
Operations below.

We believe that cash and cash equivalents, securities readily convertible to cash, current availability on
our revolving credit facility and disposition proceeds for 2010 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions, debt retirement and existing development projects through 2010. We expect that our
remaining longer-term funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings, equity issuances (including the Company’s ATM share offering program), property dispositions and cash generated from operations.



Despite the challenging conditions noted above, we believe that the Company is
well-positioned notwithstanding the slow economic recovery. Our properties are geographically diverse and were approximately 94% occupied as of December 31, 2009, little new multifamily rental supply has been added to most of our markets and
the long-term demographic picture is positive.

We believe we are well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient
liquidity to cover debt maturities and development fundings in the near term, which should allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future. When economic conditions improve, the short-term nature of our leases and the limited
supply of new rental housing being constructed should allow us to quickly realize revenue growth and improvement in our operating results.

Results of Operations

In conjunction with our business objectives
and operating strategy, the Company continued to invest or recycle its capital investment in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. In summary, we:

Year Ended December 31, 2009:

•

Acquired $145.0 million of apartment properties consisting of two properties and 566 units (excluding the Company’s buyout of its partner’s
interest in one previously unconsolidated property) and a long-term leasehold interest in a land parcel for $11.5 million, all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets; and

•

Sold $1.0 billion of apartment properties consisting of 60 properties and 12,489 units (excluding the Company’s buyout of its partner’s
interest in one previously unconsolidated property), as well as 62 condominium units for $12.0 million, the majority of which was in exit or less desirable markets.

Year Ended December 31, 2008:

•

Acquired $380.7 million of apartment properties consisting of 7 properties and 2,141 units and an uncompleted development property for $31.7 million
and invested $2.4 million to obtain the management contract rights and towards the redevelopment of a military housing project consisting of 978 units, all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets; and

•

Sold $896.7 million of apartment properties consisting of 41 properties and 10,127 units, as well as 130 condominium units for $26.1 million and a land
parcel for $3.3 million, the majority of which was in exit or less desirable markets.

The Company’s
primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income (“NOI”). NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense and property management
expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company’s apartment
communities.

Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2009 and 2008 (the “2009 Same Store Properties”),
which represented 113,598 units, impacted the Company’s results of operations. Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2008 and 2007 (the “2008 Same Store Properties”), which represented 115,051 units, also impacted the
Company’s results of operations. Both the 2009 Same Store Properties and 2008 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs.

The Company’s acquisition, disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Dilution, as a result of
the Company’s net asset sales, negatively impacts property net operating income. The impacts of these activities are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.27 compared to $1.46 per share for the year
ended December 31, 2008. The difference is primarily due to the following:



•

$57.6 million in lower net gains on sales of discontinued operations in 2009 vs. 2008;

•

$84.0 million in lower property NOI in 2009 vs. 2008, primarily driven by $51.6 million in lower same store NOI and dilution from transaction
activities, partially offset by higher NOI contributions from lease-up properties; and

•

Partially offset by $105.3 million in lower impairment losses in 2009 vs. 2008.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, income from continuing operations increased approximately $40.9 million when compared to the year
ended December 31, 2008. The increase in continuing operations is discussed below.

Revenues from the 2009 Same Store
Properties decreased $52.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in average rental rates charged to residents and a decrease in occupancy. Expenses from the 2009 Same Store Properties decreased $0.8 million primarily due to lower property
management costs, partially offset by higher real estate taxes and utility costs. The following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2009 Same Store Properties:

On-site payroll – Includes payroll and related expenses for on-site personnel including property managers, leasing consultants and maintenance staff.

(2)

Utilities – Represents gross expenses prior to any recoveries under the Resident Utility Billing System (“RUBS”). Recoveries are reflected in rental
income.

(3)

Repairs and maintenance – Includes general maintenance costs, unit turnover costs including interior painting, routine landscaping, security, exterminating, fire
protection, snow removal, elevator, roof and parking lot repairs and other miscellaneous building repair costs.

(4)

Property management costs – Includes payroll and related expenses for departments, or portions of departments, that directly support on-site
management. These include such departments as regional and corporate property management, property accounting, human resources, training, marketing and revenue management, procurement, real estate tax, property legal services



and information technology.

(5)

Other operating expenses – Includes administrative costs such as office supplies, telephone and data charges and association and business licensing fees.

The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations
to NOI for the 2009 Same Store Properties.

For properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2009 and expects to continue to own
through December 31, 2010, the Company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending December 31, 2010:

These 2010
assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.

Non-same store operating results increased
approximately $34.3 million or 79.4% and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2008 and 2009, as well as operations from the Company’s completed development properties and corporate housing business. While the operations of
the non-same store assets have been negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2009 similar to the same store assets, the non-same store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total NOI to the Company’s overall
operating results primarily due to increasing occupancy for properties in lease-up and a longer ownership period in 2009 than 2008. This increase primarily resulted from:

•

Development and other miscellaneous properties in lease-up of $22.4 million;

•

Newly stabilized development and other miscellaneous properties of $1.6 million;

•

Properties acquired in 2008 and 2009 of $11.9 million; and

•

Partially offset by operating activities from other miscellaneous operations.

See also Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Company’s segment
disclosures.

Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased approximately $0.1
million or 3.4% primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on management of the Company’s military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base, as well as a decrease in asset management expenses. As of December 31, 2009
and 2008, the Company managed 12,681 units and 14,485 units, respectively, primarily for unconsolidated entities and its military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord.

Property management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Company’s
properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses decreased approximately $5.1 million or 6.7%. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower overall payroll-related costs as a result of a decrease
in the number of properties in the Company’s portfolio, as well as



decreases in temporary help/contractors, telecommunications and travel expenses.

Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately $22.8 million or 4.1% primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2008
and 2009, development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned.

General and
administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $6.0 million or 13.3% primarily due to lower overall payroll-related costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties
in the Company’s portfolio, as well as a $2.9 million decrease in severance related costs in 2009 and a decrease in tax consulting costs. The Company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate $38.0 million to $40.0
million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.

Impairment from continuing operations decreased approximately $105.3 million due to an $11.1 million impairment charge taken during 2009 on a land parcel held for development compared to a $116.4 million impairment charge taken in the
fourth quarter of 2008 on land held for development related to five potential development projects that are no longer being pursued. See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately $16.8 million or 50.2% primarily as a result of an $18.7
million gain recognized during 2008 related to the partial debt extinguishment of the Company’s notes compared to a $4.5 million gain recognized in 2009 (see Note 9). In addition, interest earned on cash and cash equivalents decreased due to a
decrease in interest rates and because the Company received less insurance/litigation settlement proceeds and forfeited deposits in 2009, partially offset by a $4.9 million gain on the sale of investment securities realized in 2009. The Company
anticipates that interest and other income will approximate $1.0 million to $3.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.

Other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately $0.7 million or 12.6% primarily due to an increase in transaction costs
incurred in conjunction with the Company’s acquisition of two properties consisting of 566 units from unaffiliated parties, as well as expensing transaction costs associated with the Company’s acquisition of all of its partners’
interests in five previously partially owned properties consisting of 1,587 units in 2009. This was partially offset by a decrease in pursuit cost write-offs as a result of the Company’s decision to significantly reduce its development
activities in 2009. The Company anticipates that other expenses will approximate $9.0 million to $12.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.

Interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased approximately $17.4 million or
3.5% primarily as a result of an increase in debt extinguishment costs and lower capitalized interest. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $34.9 million as compared to $60.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2008. This capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 5.62% as compared
to 5.56% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company anticipates that interest expense will approximate $466.0 million to $476.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and
is forward-looking.

Income and other tax expense from continuing operations decreased approximately $2.5 million or 46.9%
primarily due to a change in the estimate for Texas state taxes and lower overall state income taxes, partially offset by an increase in business taxes for Washington, D.C. The Company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate
$1.0 million to $2.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.

Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $2.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the Company’s $1.8 million share of
defeasance costs incurred in conjunction with the extinguishment of cross-collateralized mortgage debt on one of the Company’s partially owned unconsolidated joint ventures as well as a decline in the operating performance of these properties.

Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased approximately $7.8 million as the Company sold seven unconsolidated
properties in 2009 (inclusive of the one property where the Company acquired its partner’s interest) compared to three unconsolidated properties in 2008.



Net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately $3.0 million due to the sale of
vacant land located in Florida during the year ended December 31, 2008 versus no land sales in 2009.

Discontinued
operations, net decreased approximately $95.2 million or 21.2% between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily due to lower gains from property sales during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008
and the operations of those properties. In addition, properties sold in 2009 reflect operations for a partial period in 2009 in contrast to a full period in 2008. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007

For the year ended December 31, 2008, loss from continuing operations increased approximately $33.9 million when compared to the year
ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in continuing operations is discussed below.

Revenues from the 2008 Same Store
Properties increased $53.8 million primarily as a result of higher rental rates charged to residents. Expenses from the 2008 Same Store Properties increased $13.5 million primarily due to higher real estate taxes, utility costs and payroll. The
following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2008 Same Store Properties:

2008 vs. 2007

Same Store Results/Statistics

$ in thousands (except for Average Rental Rate) – 115,051 Same Store Units

Average rental rate is defined as total rental revenues divided by the weighted average occupied units for the period.

Non-same store operating results increased approximately $66.1 million or 79.8% and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar
years 2008 and 2007, as well as operations from completed development properties and our corporate housing business.

See also
Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Company’s segment disclosures.

Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased approximately $2.0 million primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on management of the Company’s military housing venture at Fort Lewis
along with the addition of McChord Air Force Base, as well as a decrease in asset management expenses. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company managed 14,485 units and 14,472 units, respectively, primarily for unconsolidated entities and
its military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord.

Property management expenses from continuing operations include
off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses decreased approximately $10.4 million or 11.9%. This decrease is primarily
attributable to lower overall payroll-related costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the Company’s portfolio, as well as a decrease in legal and professional fees.

Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately $28.3
million or 5.3% primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2007 and 2008 and capital expenditures for all properties owned.

General and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $1.8 million or 3.9% primarily as a result of a $2.2 million decrease in
profit sharing expense and lower overall payroll-related costs, partially offset by an increase in legal and professional fees due to a $1.7



million expense recovery recorded for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to a certain lawsuit in Florida (see Note 21).

Impairment from continuing operations increased approximately $116.4 million due to an impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2008
on land held for development related to five potential development projects that will no longer be pursued. See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately $13.5 million or 67.3% primarily as a result of an $18.7
million gain recognized during the year ended December 31, 2008 related to the partial debt extinguishment of the Company’s June 2009 and August 2026 public notes (see Note 9), as well as an increase in short-term investments. This was
partially offset by a $7.3 million decrease in interest earned on 1031 exchange and earnest money deposits due primarily to the decline in the Company’s transaction activities.

Other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately $3.9 million primarily due to an increase in the write-off of various
pursuit and out-of-pocket costs for terminated development transactions and halted condominium conversion properties during 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007.

Interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $0.2 million as a
result of lower overall effective interest rates and a reduction in debt extinguishment costs, offset by higher overall debt levels outstanding due to the Company’s 2007 share repurchase activity and its pre-funding of its 2008 and 2009 debt
maturities. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $60.1 million as compared to $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This capitalization of interest primarily relates
to consolidated projects under development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 5.56% as compared to 5.96% for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Income and other tax expense from continuing operations increased approximately $2.8 million primarily due to a change in the estimate for
Texas state taxes and an increase in franchise taxes.

Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased
approximately $0.4 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily due to income received in 2007 from the sale of the Company’s 7.075% ownership interest in Wellsford Park Highlands Corporation, an entity which owns a
condominium development in Denver, Colorado.

Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased approximately $0.2
million primarily due to a $2.9 million gain on the sale of three unconsolidated institutional joint venture properties realized in 2008 compared to a gain of $2.6 million realized in 2007 on the sale of one property.

Net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately $3.4 million primarily as a result of higher net gains realized in 2007 on the
sale of two land parcels compared to the net gain realized in 2008 on the sale of one land parcel.

Discontinued operations,
net decreased approximately $577.1 million or 56.2% between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily due to a significant decrease in the number of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same
period in 2007, as well as the mix of properties sold in each year. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

For the Year Ended
December 31, 2009

As of January 1, 2009, the Company had approximately $890.8 million of cash and cash
equivalents and $1.29 billion available under its revolving credit facility (net of $130.0 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and $75.0 million which had been committed by a now bankrupt financial institution and is
not available for borrowing). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2009
was approximately $193.3 million, its restricted 1031 exchange proceeds totaled $244.3 million and the amount available on the Company’s revolving credit facility was $1.37 billion (net of $56.7 million which was restricted/dedicated to support
letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed above). In 2008, the Company built a significant cash and cash equivalents balance as a direct result of its decision to pre-fund its 2008 and 2009 debt maturities with the closing of three
secured mortgage loan pools totaling $1.6 billion. The decline in the Company’s cash and cash



equivalents balance since December 31, 2008 is a direct result of the application of the pre-funded cash on hand towards the Company’s debt maturity, tender and repurchase activities,
partially offset by the closing of a $500.0 million secured mortgage loan pool during 2009. See Notes 8 through 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company generated proceeds from various transactions, which included the following:

•

Disposed of 61 properties (including the Company’s buyout of its partner’s interest in one unconsolidated property) and 62 condominium units,
receiving net proceeds of $893.6 million;

•

Obtained $540.0 million in new mortgage financing and terminated six treasury locks, receiving $10.8 million;

•

Obtained an additional $198.8 million of new mortgage loans on development properties;

•

Received $215.8 million from maturing or sold investment securities; and

•

Issued approximately 4.2 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $100.6 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the above proceeds were primarily utilized to:

•

Invest $330.6 million primarily in development projects;

•

Acquire three rental properties (including the Company’s buyout of its partner’s interest in one unconsolidated property) and a long-term
leasehold interest in a land parcel, utilizing cash of $175.5 million;

•

Repurchase 47,450 Common Shares, utilizing cash of $1.1 million (see Note 3);

•

Repurchase $652.1 million of fixed rate public notes;

•

Repay $122.2 million of fixed rate public notes at maturity;

•

Repurchase $75.8 million of fixed rate tax-exempt notes;

•

Repay $956.8 million of mortgage loans; and

•

Acquire $77.8 million of investment securities.

In September 2009, the Company announced the creation of an At-The-Market (“ATM”) share offering program which would allow the Company to sell up to 17.0 million Common Shares from time to
time over the next three years into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. The Company may, but shall have no obligation to, sell Common Shares through the ATM share offering program in
amounts and at times to be determined by the Company. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of the Company’s Common
Shares and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company issued approximately 3.5 million Common Shares at an average price of $35.38 per share for total
consideration of approximately $123.7 million through the ATM share offering program. In addition, during the first quarter of 2010 through February 19, 2010, the Company has issued approximately 1.1 million Common Shares at an average
price of $33.87 per share for total consideration of approximately $35.8 million. Cumulative to date, the Company has issued approximately 4.6 million Common Shares at an average price of $35.03 for total consideration of approximately $159.5
million. As of February 19, 2010, the Company had 12.4 million Common Shares remaining available for issuance under the ATM program.

Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions, and other opportunities for the investment of available capital, the Company may repurchase its Common Shares pursuant to its existing
share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Trustees. The Company repurchased $1.1 million (47,450 shares at an average price per share of $23.69) of its Common Shares during the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31,
2009, the Company had authorization to repurchase an additional $466.5 million of its shares. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Depending on its analysis of prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, the Company
may from time to time seek to repurchase and retire its outstanding debt in open market or privately negotiated transactions.

Operating Partnership under a registration statement that became automatically effective upon filing with the SEC in December 2008 (under SEC regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement automatically expires on December 21, 2011 and
does not contain a maximum issuance amount). As of February 25, 2010, an unlimited amount of equity securities remains available for issuance by the Company under a registration statement the SEC declared effective in December 2008 (under SEC
regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement automatically expires on December 15, 2011 and does not contain a maximum issuance amount).



The Company’s “Consolidated Debt-to-Total Market Capitalization Ratio” as of

The Company
generally expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, through its working capital, net cash
provided by operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Under normal operating conditions, the Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of
distributions. However, there may be times when the Company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions, which may cause the Company to consider reducing its distributions and/or using the proceeds from property dispositions or
additional financing transactions to make up the difference. Should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature, the Company’s financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its
current distribution levels. The Company reduced its quarterly common share dividend beginning with the dividend for the third quarter of 2009, from $0.4825 per share (an annual rate of $1.93 per share) to $0.3375 per share (an annual rate of $1.35
per share). The Company believes that its expected 2010 operating cash flow is sufficient to cover capital expenditures and distributions.



The Company also expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled
unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities, including additional OP
Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties as well as joint ventures. In addition, the Company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public
capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high. The fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with
covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. Of the $18.5 billion in investment in real estate on the Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2009, $11.2 billion or 60.9%, was unencumbered. However, there can be no assurances
that these sources of capital will be available to the Company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise.

As of the date
of this filing, the Operating Partnership’s senior debt credit ratings from Standard & Poors (“S&P”), Moody’s and Fitch are BBB+, Baal and A-, respectively. As of the date of this filing, the Company’s preferred
equity ratings from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch are BBB-, Baa2 and BBB, respectively. During the third quarter of 2009, Moody’s and Fitch placed both the Company and the Operating Partnership on negative outlook.

The Operating Partnership has a $1.5 billion long-term revolving credit facility with available borrowings as of February 19, 2010 of
$1.36 billion (net of $65.2 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of a $75.0 million commitment from a now bankrupt financial institution) that matures in February 2012 (See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion). This facility may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short-term liquidity requirements. As of February 19, 2010,
$180.0 million was outstanding under this facility. The Company expects to repay essentially all of the outstanding balance under the line as dispositions close and restricted 1031 proceeds are released from escrow.

See Note 21 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to December 31,
2009.

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate

Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the
useful life of the component asset of the property. We track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories:

•

Replacements

(inside the unit)

. These include:

•

flooring such as carpets, hardwood, vinyl, linoleum or tile;

•

appliances;

•

mechanical equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc;

•

furniture and fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc; and

•

blinds/shades.

All replacements are depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life. We expense as incurred all make-ready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item
noted above.

•

Building improvements

(outside the unit)

. These include:

•

roof replacement and major repairs;

•

paving or major resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks;

•

amenities and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and
offices;

•

major building mechanical equipment systems;

•

interior and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding;

•

major landscaping and grounds improvement; and

•

vehicles and office and maintenance equipment.

All building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten-year estimated useful life. We capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $2,500 (selected projects must
exceed $10,000); (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) improves the value of the asset.



For the year ended December 31, 2009, our actual improvements to real estate totaled
approximately $123.9 million. This includes the following (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):

Capital Expenditures to Real Estate

For the Year Ended December 31, 2009

(1)

Total Units – Excludes 8,086 unconsolidated units and 4,595 military housing units, for which capital expenditures to real estate are self-funded and do not
consolidate into the Company’s results.

(2)

Replacements – For same store properties includes $28.0 million spent on various assets related to unit renovations/rehabs (primarily kitchens and baths) designed
to reposition these assets for higher rental levels in their respective markets.

(3)

Same Store Properties – Primarily includes all properties acquired or completed and stabilized prior to January 1, 2008, less properties subsequently sold.

(4)

Non-Same Store Properties – Primarily includes all properties acquired during 2008 and 2009, plus any properties in lease-up and not stabilized as of
January 1, 2008. Per unit amounts are based on a weighted average of 9,823 units.

(5)

Other – Primarily includes expenditures for properties sold during the period.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $169.8 million. This includes the
following (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):

Capital Expenditures to Real Estate

For the Year Ended December 31, 2008

(1)

Total Units – Excludes 9,776 unconsolidated units and 4,709 military housing units, for which capital expenditures to real estate are self-funded and do not
consolidate into the Company’s results.

(2)

Established Properties – Wholly Owned Properties acquired prior to January 1, 2006.

(3)

New Acquisition Properties – Wholly Owned Properties acquired during 2006, 2007 and 2008. Per unit amounts are based on a weighted average of 18,983 units.

(4)

Other – Includes properties either partially owned or sold during the period, commercial space, corporate housing and condominium conversions. Also includes $34.2
million included in replacements spent on various assets related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets.

The Company incurred less in capital expenditures in 2009 primarily due to continued efforts to limit the scope of projects and greater cost controls on vendors. For 2010, the Company estimates that it will spend approximately $1,075 per
unit of capital expenditures for its same store properties inclusive of unit renovation/rehab costs, or $825 per unit excluding unit renovation/rehab costs. The above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company’s total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer software,
computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Company’s property management offices and its corporate offices, were approximately $2.0 million. The Company expects to fund approximately $1.6 million in total
additions to non-real estate property in 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.



Improvements to real estate and additions to non-real estate property are generally funded
from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow.

Derivative Instruments

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to limit these risks by
following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.

The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting
exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of
derivatives it currently has in place.

See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
discussion of derivative instruments at December 31, 2009.

Other

Total distributions paid in January 2010 amounted to $100.7 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included
certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
and Contractual Obligations

The Company has co-invested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted
for under the equity method of accounting. Management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the Company’s liquidity, cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than its property management and
ownership activities. During 2000 and 2001, the Company entered into institutional ventures with an unaffiliated partner. At the respective closing dates, the Company sold and/or contributed 45 properties containing 10,846 units to these ventures
and retained a 25% ownership interest in the ventures. The Company’s joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed-upon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company. The
Company’s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets. The Company sold seven properties consisting of 1,684 units (including one property containing 250 units which was acquired
by the Company), three properties consisting of 670 units and one property consisting of 400 units during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company and its joint venture partner currently intend to wind up
these investments over the next few years by selling the related assets, which may involve refinancing the assets as a majority of the debt encumbering them matures in 2010 and early 2011. The Company cannot estimate what, if any, profit it will
receive from these dispositions or if the Company will in fact receive its equity back.

As of December 31, 2009, the
Company has four projects totaling 1,700 units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30, 2011. The development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in Note 18 of the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

See also Notes 2 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional discussion regarding the Company’s investments in partially owned entities.

The following table
summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2009:



(a)

Amounts include aggregate principal payments only and includes in 2010 a $500.0 million term loan that the Company has the right to extend to 2012.

(b)

Amounts include interest expected to be incurred on the Company’s secured and unsecured debt based on obligations outstanding at December 31, 2009 and
inclusive of capitalized interest. For floating rate debt, the current rate in effect for the most recent payment through December 31, 2009 is assumed to be in effect through the respective maturity date of each instrument.

(c)

Minimum basic rent due for various office space the Company leases and fixed base rent due on ground leases for four properties/parcels.

(d)

Estimated payments to the Company’s Chairman, Vice Chairman and two former CEO’s based on planned retirement dates.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies,
including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies
would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements.

The
Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31,
2009 and are consistent with the year ended December 31, 2008, except with respect to noncontrolling interests and convertible debt as further described in Note 2.

The Company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial
condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information
that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. The five critical accounting policies are:

Acquisition of Investment Properties

The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible
and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in
connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The Company also considers information obtained about each
property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically evaluates its
long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate, for indicators of permanent impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal and
environmental concerns, as well as the Company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.

Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate

The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30-year estimated useful life, building improvements
over a 5-year to 10-year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5-year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations.

Cost Capitalization

See the

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate

section for a discussion of the Company’s policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the
Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase
to depreciable property.



For all development projects, the Company uses its professional judgment in determining
whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend
all of their time on development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction-in-progress for each specific property.
The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected
properties when additional incremental employees are hired.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative
Instruments

The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the
fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases
its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.

Funds From Operations

For the year ended December 31, 2009, Funds From Operations
(“FFO”) available to Common Shares and Units decreased $2.9 million, or 0.5%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, FFO available to Common Shares and Units decreased $95.0
million, or 13.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007.

The following is a reconciliation of net income to
FFO available to Common Shares and Units for each of the five years ended December 31, 2009:

Funds From Operations

(Amounts in thousands)

(1)

The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from operations (“FFO”) (April 2002 White
Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss
on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. FFO available to Common
Shares and Units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and



reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the “Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership”.
Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

(2)

The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real
estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of
identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as
compared to different companies. FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO and FFO
available to Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as measures of liquidity. The
Company’s calculation of FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be
comparable to such other real estate companies.

(3)

Effective January 1, 2009, companies are required to retrospectively expense certain implied costs of the option value related to convertible debt. As a result,
net income, FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units have all been reduced by approximately $10.6 million, $13.3 million, $10.1 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risks relating to the Company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in short-term LIBOR interest rates and changes in the SIFMA index for tax-exempt debt. The Company does not
have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk.

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and term credit facilities as well as floating rate tax-exempt debt. The Company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate
debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long-term fixed rate financing. The Company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors,
including its assessment of the current and future economic environment. To the extent the Company carries, as it did at December 31, 2008, substantial cash balances, this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in
interest rates.

The Company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk. Interest rate
protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. The Company does not
enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. See also Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments.

The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments (including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and
cash equivalents, other assets, lines of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities) approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature, terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates. The
fair value of the Company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $1.8 billion, or 19.7% of total debt, net
of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 13 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the increase in
interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.4 million. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 13 basis points (a 10% decrease from the
Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.4 million.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $7.5 billion, or 80.3% of total debt, net of
the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 59 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed
rate debt would be approximately $6.9 billion. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 59 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s
fixed rate debt would be approximately $8.4 billion.

At December 31, 2009, the Company’s derivative instruments had
a net asset fair value of approximately $25.2 million. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 20 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the net asset fair value of the
Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately $35.5 million. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 20 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the net asset fair
value of the Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately $15.9 million.

At December 31, 2008, the
Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $1.9 billion, or 18.3% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 34 basis
points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $6.5 million. If market rates of
interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 34 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future
earnings and cash flows by approximately $6.5 million.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had total outstanding fixed
rate debt of approximately $8.6 billion, or 81.7% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 58 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average
interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $7.8 billion. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 58



basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $9.5 billion.

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately $19,000.
If market rates of interest permanently increased by 15 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the net asset fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately $1.7
million. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 15 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments would be
approximately $1.8 million.

These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the
Company’s financial instruments. The foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the Company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities. These analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in
overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of changes of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes. However, due to the uncertainty of the
specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Company’s financial structure or results.

The Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and, therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any assurance that long-term
debt will be available at advantageous pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.

Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:

Effective as of December 31, 2009, the
Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in its Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

Equity Residential’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Based on the Company’s evaluation under the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2009. Our internal control over financial reporting has been audited as of December 31, 2009 by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.



(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

There were no changes to the internal control over financial reporting of the Company identified in connection with the Company’s
evaluation referred to above that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Equity Residential (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index to the consolidated financial statements and schedule. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Equity Residential at December 31, 2009 and
2008 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Equity Residential changed its method of accounting for convertible debt
instruments and noncontrolling interests upon the adoption of new accounting pronouncements, effective January 1, 2009 and applied retrospectively.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Equity Residential’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2010 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential

We have audited Equity Residential’s (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009,
based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Criteria”). Equity Residential’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Equity Residential maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO Criteria.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Equity Residential as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 of Equity Residential and our report dated February 25, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Business

Equity Residential (“EQR”), a Maryland real estate
investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be taxed as a
REIT.

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2009 owned an approximate 95.2% ownership interest in, ERP
Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”) under which all property ownership and related business operations
are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. References to the “Company” include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of
495 properties in 23 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 137,007 units. The ownership breakdown includes (table does not include various uncompleted development properties):

The “Wholly
Owned Properties” are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting. The Company beneficially owns 100% fee simple title to 429 of the 432 Wholly Owned Properties and all but one of its wholly owned development properties and land
parcels. The Company owns the building and improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements under long-term ground leases that expire in 2026, 2077 and 2101 for the three operating properties, respectively, and 2104 for one land parcel.
These properties are consolidated and reflected as real estate assets while the ground leases are accounted for as operating leases.

The “Partially Owned Properties – Consolidated” are controlled by the Company but have partners with noncontrolling interests and are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting. The “Partially Owned
Properties – Unconsolidated” are partially owned but not controlled by the Company and consist of investments in partnership interests that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The “Military Housing”
properties consist of investments in limited liability companies that, as a result of the terms of the operating agreements, are accounted for as management contract rights with all fees recognized as fee and asset management revenue.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

Due to the Company’s ability as general
partner to control either through ownership or by contract the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, other than entities that own controlling interests in the Partially Owned Properties – Unconsolidated and certain other entities in which
the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The consolidated financial statements also include all variable interest entities for which the
Company is the primary beneficiary.

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate

Effective for business combinations on or after January 1, 2009, an acquiring entity is required to recognize all
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. In addition, an acquiring entity is required to expense acquisition-related costs as incurred (amounts are included in the other
expenses line item in the consolidated statements of operations), value noncontrolling interests at fair value at the acquisition date and expense restructuring costs associated with an acquired business. Due to the Company’s limited
acquisition activities in 2009, this has not had a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. Should the Company increase its acquisition activities, the effect could become material.

F-12


The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified
intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with
the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result
of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired real estate to various components as follows:

•

Land – Based on actual purchase price if acquired separately or market research/comparables if acquired with an operating property.

•

Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment – Ranges between $8,000 and $13,000 per apartment unit acquired as an estimate of the fair value of the
appliances and fixtures inside a unit. The per-unit amount applied depends on the type of apartment building acquired. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five years.

•

In-Place Leases – The Company considers the value of acquired in-place leases and the amortization period is the average remaining term of each
respective in-place acquired lease.

•

Other Intangible Assets – The Company considers whether it has acquired other intangible assets, including any customer relationship intangibles
and the amortization period is the estimated useful life of the acquired intangible asset.

•

Building – Based on the fair value determined on an “as-if vacant” basis. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over an
estimated useful life of thirty years.

Replacements inside a unit such as appliances and carpeting are
depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are
capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally five to ten years. Initial direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense approximates the deferral and amortization of initial direct leasing costs over the lease terms.
Property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers to unrelated third parties, contingencies have been removed and sufficient cash consideration has been received by the Company. Upon disposition, the related costs and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the respective accounts. Any gain or loss on sale is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

The Company classifies real estate assets as real estate held for disposition when it is certain a property will be disposed of (see further
discussion below).

The Company classifies properties under development and/or expansion and properties in the lease-up phase
(including land) as construction-in-progress until construction has been completed and all certificates of occupancy permits have been obtained.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically evaluates
its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate, for indicators of permanent impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal
and environmental concerns, as well as the Company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is
warranted.

For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows for
the long-lived asset against the carrying amount of that asset. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company further analyzes each individual asset for other temporary or permanent
indicators of impairment. An impairment loss would be recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset if the Company deems this difference to be permanent.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the asset, less the estimated
cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the asset measured at the time that the Company has determined it will sell the asset. Long-lived assets held for disposition and the related liabilities are separately reported, with the long-lived
assets reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values, less their costs to sell, and are not depreciated after reclassification to real estate held for disposition.

F-13


Cost Capitalization

See the

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate

section for a discussion of the Company’s policy with
respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of
major capital and/or renovation projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.

For all development projects, the Company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and
insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of
occupancy. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction-in-progress for each specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on
our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions. The combined account balances at one or more institutions typically exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”) insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. The Company believes that the risk is not significant, as the Company does not
anticipate the financial institutions’ non-performance.

Investment Securities

Investment securities are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. These securities are classified as held-to-maturity
and carried at amortized cost if management has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Otherwise, the securities are classified as available-for-sale and carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses
included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

Deferred
Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain the Company’s lines of credit
and long-term financings. These costs are amortized over the terms of the related debt. Unamortized financing costs are written off when debt is retired before the maturity date. The accumulated amortization of such deferred financing costs was
$34.6 million and $31.4 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments,
Including Derivative Instruments

The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to make estimates and
judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not
available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures
including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.

The Company has a policy of only entering
into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a
material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measures those instruments at fair value. In addition, fair value adjustments will affect
either shareholders’ equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. When the terms of an underlying transaction are modified, or
when the underlying transaction is

F-14


terminated or completed, all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked-to-market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures. Any derivative
instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria is marked-to-market each period. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income attributable to residential leases is recorded on a straight-line basis, which is not materially different than if it were recorded when due from residents and recognized monthly as it was
earned. Leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year-to-year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. Fee and asset management revenue and interest income
are recorded on an accrual basis.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company expenses share-based compensation such as restricted shares and share options. The fair value of the option grants are recognized
over the vesting period of the options. The fair value for the Company’s share options was estimated at the time the share options were granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

(1)

Expected volatility – Estimated based on the historical volatility of EQR’s share price, on a monthly basis, for a period matching the expected life of each
grant.

(2)

Expected life – Approximates the actual weighted average life of all share options granted since the Company went public in 1993.

(3)

Expected dividend yield – Calculated by averaging the historical annual yield on EQR shares for a period matching the expected life of each grant, with the annual
yield calculated by dividing actual dividends by the average price of EQR’s shares in a given year.

(4)

Risk-free interest rate – The most current U.S. Treasury rate available prior to the grant date for a period matching the expected life of each grant.

The valuation method and assumptions are the same as those the Company used in accounting for option expense in
its consolidated financial statements. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. This model is only one method of
valuing options and the Company’s use of this model should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy. Because the Company’s share options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its share options and the actual
value of the options may be significantly different.

Income and Other Taxes

Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations of its operating properties, no provision for federal income
taxes has been made at the EQR level. Historically, the Company has generally only incurred certain state and local income, excise and franchise taxes. The Company has elected Taxable REIT Subsidiary (“TRS”) status for certain of its
corporate subsidiaries, primarily those entities engaged in condominium conversion and corporate housing activities and as a result, these entities will incur both federal and state income taxes on any taxable income of such entities after
consideration of any net operating losses.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. These assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates for which the temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effects of deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings in the period enacted. The Company’s deferred tax assets are generally the result of tax affected amortization of goodwill,
differing depreciable lives on capitalized assets

F-15


and the timing of expense recognition for certain accrued liabilities. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $42.5 million, which is fully
offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty in forecasting future TRS taxable income.

The Company provided for
income, franchise and excise taxes allocated as follows in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (amounts in thousands):

(1)

Primarily includes state and local income, excise and franchise taxes.

(2)

Primarily represents federal income taxes (recovered) on the gains on sales of condominium units owned by a TRS and included in discontinued operations. Also represents
state and local income, excise and franchise taxes on operating properties sold and included in discontinued operations.

(3)

All provision for income tax amounts are current and none are deferred.

The Company’s TRS’ carried back approximately $7.3 million and $13.9 million of net operating losses (“NOL”) during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and
none were carried back in 2009. The Company’s TRS’ have approximately $46.7 million of NOL carryforwards available as of January 1, 2010 that will expire in 2028 and 2029.

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company’s tax treatment of dividends and distributions were as
follows:

The cost of land and depreciable property, net of
accumulated depreciation, for federal income tax purposes as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $10.4 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively.

Noncontrolling Interests

Effective January 1, 2009, a
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (minority interest) is in most cases an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent company’s
equity. In addition, consolidated net income is required to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest and the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the
noncontrolling interest are required to be disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Other than modifications to allocations and presentation, this does not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results
of operations or financial position. See Note 3 for further discussion.

Operating Partnership: Net income is allocated to
noncontrolling interests based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. The ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the number of units of limited partnership interest (“OP Units”) held by the
noncontrolling interests by the total OP Units held by the noncontrolling interests and EQR. Issuance of additional common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the “Common Shares”), and OP Units changes the ownership
interests of both the noncontrolling interests and EQR. Such transactions and the related proceeds are treated as capital transactions.

F-16


Partially Owned Properties: The Company reflects noncontrolling interests in partially owned
properties on the balance sheet for the portion of properties consolidated by the Company that are not wholly owned by the Company. The earnings or losses from those properties attributable to the noncontrolling interests are reflected as
noncontrolling interests in partially owned properties in the consolidated statements of operations.

Redeemable
Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership: The Company classifies Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet for the portion of OP Units that the Company is required,
either by contract or securities law, to deliver registered EQR Common Shares to the exchanging OP Unit holder. The redeemable noncontrolling interest units are adjusted to the greater of carrying value or fair market value based on the Common Share
price of EQR at the end of each respective reporting period.

Use of Estimates

In preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications considered necessary for a fair presentation have been made to the prior period financial
statements in order to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations or equity.

Other

In June 2009, the FASB issued

The FASB Accounting
Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

, which superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards and became the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities. The Company adopted the codification as required, effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. The adoption of the codification has no impact on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position but changed the way we refer to accounting literature in reports beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2009.

Effective December 31, 2008, public companies were required to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets. In
addition, public enterprises, including sponsors that have a variable interest in a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”), were required to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with VIEs. For the Company, this includes only
its development partnerships as the Company provides substantially all of the capital for these ventures (other than third party mortgage debt, if any). These requirements affected only disclosures and had no impact on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Effective January 1, 2010, companies will be required to
provide more information about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions and where companies have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets. The concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity
will be eliminated, the requirements for derecognizing financial assets will change and additional disclosures will be required. The Company does not expect this will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial
position.

Effective January 1, 2010, the way in which a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently
capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar) rights should be consolidated will change. The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity will be based on, among other things, an entity’s purpose and
design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. The Company does not expect this will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations
or financial position.

The Company is required to make certain disclosures regarding noncontrolling interests in consolidated
limited-life subsidiaries. The Company is presently the controlling partner in various consolidated partnerships consisting of 27 properties and 5,530 units and various uncompleted development properties having a noncontrolling interest book value
of $11.1 million at December 31, 2009. Some of these partnership agreements contain provisions that require the partnerships to be liquidated through the sale of their assets upon reaching a date specified in each respective partnership
agreement. The Company, as controlling partner, has an obligation to cause the property owning partnerships to distribute the proceeds of liquidation to the Noncontrolling Interests in these Partially Owned Properties only to the

F-17


extent that the net proceeds received by the partnerships from the sale of their assets warrant a distribution based on the partnership agreements. As of December 31, 2009, the Company
estimates the value of Noncontrolling Interest distributions would have been approximately $45.5 million (“Settlement Value”) had the partnerships been liquidated. This Settlement Value is based on estimated third party consideration
realized by the partnerships upon disposition of the Partially Owned Properties and is net of all other assets and liabilities, including yield maintenance on the mortgages encumbering the properties, that would have been due on December 31,
2009 had those mortgages been prepaid. Due to, among other things, the inherent uncertainty in the sale of real estate assets, the amount of any potential distribution to the Noncontrolling Interests in the Company’s Partially Owned Properties
is subject to change. To the extent that the partnerships’ underlying assets are worth less than the underlying liabilities, the Company has no obligation to remit any consideration to the Noncontrolling Interests in these Partially Owned
Properties.

Effective January 1, 2008, the rules governing fair value measurements changed. These rules established a
comprehensive framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and required expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. This did not have a material effect on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. See Note 11 for further discussion.

Effective
January 1, 2008, companies were permitted to elect a “Fair Value Option” under which a company may irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial instruments. The Fair Value
Option is available on a contract-by-contract basis with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as those changes occur. The Company has not adopted this optional standard.

Effective for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, disclosures about fair value of financial instruments are required for interim reporting
periods in summarized financial information for publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. This does not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. See Note 11 for
further discussion.

Effective January 1, 2010, companies will be required to discuss the reasons for transfers into or
out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and, if significant, disclose these transfers on a gross basis. Companies will also be required to disclose significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and the reasons for these transfers. In
addition, companies should provide fair value disclosures by each class rather than major category of assets and liabilities as well as the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of assets or liabilities classified as
Level 2 or 3. The Company does not expect this will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Effective January 1, 2011, companies will be required to separately disclose purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements. The
Company does not expect this will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Effective January 1, 2009, in an effort to improve financial standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, companies are required to enhance disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an
entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Among other requirements, entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about: (1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (2) how derivative
instruments and related hedged items are accounted for; and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Other than the enhanced disclosure
requirements, this does not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 11 for further discussion.

Effective for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, companies are required to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events in accordance with general standards of accounting
for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. For public companies, this is the date the financial statements are issued. This does not have a material
effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Effective January 1, 2009,
issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects each issuer’s nonconvertible debt
borrowing rate. As the Company is required to apply this retrospectively, the accounting for the Operating Partnership’s $650.0 million ($482.5 million outstanding at December 31, 2009) 3.85% convertible unsecured notes that were issued in
August 2006 and mature in August 2026 is affected. The Company recognized $20.6 million, $24.4 million and $25.0 million in interest expense related to the stated coupon of 3.85% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The amount of the conversion option as of the date of issuance calculated by the Company using a 5.80% effective interest rate was $44.3 million and is being amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the convertible notes
(through the first put date on August 18, 2011). Total

F-18


amortization of the cash discount and conversion option discount on the unsecured notes resulted in a reduction to earnings of approximately $10.6 million or $0.04 per share for the year ended
December 31, 2009 and is anticipated to result in a reduction to earnings of approximately $7.8 million or $0.03 per share for the year ended December 31, 2010 assuming the Company does not repurchase any additional amounts of this debt.
In addition, the Company decreased the January 1, 2009 balance of retained earnings by $27.0 million, decreased the January 1, 2009 balance of notes by $17.3 million and increased the January 1, 2009 balance of paid in capital by
$44.3 million. Due to the required retrospective application, it resulted in a reduction to earnings of approximately $13.3 million or $0.05 per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 and approximately $10.1 million or $0.04 per share for
the year ended December 31, 2007. The carrying amount of the conversion option remaining in paid in capital was $44.3 million at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. The unamortized cash and conversion option discounts totaled $12.8 million
and $23.4 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

3. Equity and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

The following tables present the changes in the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Shares and “Units” (which includes OP
Units and Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) Units) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

As of
December 31, 2009, an unlimited amount of equity securities remains available for issuance by the Company under a registration statement the SEC declared effective in December 2008 (under SEC regulations enacted in 2005, the registration
statement automatically expires on December 15, 2011 and does not contain a maximum issuance amount).

F-19


In September 2009, the Company announced the creation of an At-The-Market (“ATM”)
share offering program which would allow the Company to sell up to 17.0 million Common Shares from time to time over the next three years into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions.
During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company issued approximately 3.5 million Common Shares at an average price of $35.38 per share for total consideration of approximately $123.7 million through the ATM program. As of
December 31, 2009, transactions to issue approximately 1.1 million of the 3.5 million Common Shares had not yet settled. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has increased the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding by
this amount and recorded a receivable of approximately $37.6 million included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. EQR has authorization to issue an additional 13.5 million of its shares as of December 31, 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Board of Trustees approved increases totaling $1.2 billion to the Company’s
authorized share repurchase program. Considering the additional authorizations and the repurchase activity for the year ended December 31, 2009, EQR has authorization to repurchase an additional $466.5 million of its shares as of
December 31, 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased 47,450 of its Common Shares at
an average price of $23.69 per share for total consideration of $1.1 million. These shares were retired subsequent to the repurchases. All of the shares repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2009 were repurchased from employees at the
then current market prices to cover the minimum statutory tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of employees’ restricted shares.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 220,085 of its Common Shares at an average price of $35.93 per share for total consideration of $7.9 million. These shares were
retired subsequent to the repurchases. Of the total shares repurchased, 120,085 shares were repurchased from employees at an average price of $36.10 per share (the average of the then current market prices) to cover the minimum statutory tax
withholding obligations related to the vesting of employees’ restricted shares. The remaining 100,000 shares were repurchased in the open market at an average price of $35.74 per share. The Company also funded $4.6 million in January 2008 for
the settlement of 125,000 Common Shares that were repurchased in December 2007 and recorded as other liabilities at December 31, 2007.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company repurchased 27,484,346 of its Common Shares at an average price of $44.62 per share for total consideration of $1.2 billion. These shares were
retired subsequent to the repurchases. Of the total shares repurchased, 84,046 shares were repurchased from employees at an average price of $53.85 per share (the average of the then current market prices) to cover the minimum statutory tax
withholding obligations related to the vesting of employees’ restricted shares. The remaining 27,400,300 shares were repurchased in the open market at an average price of $44.59 per share. As of December 31, 2007, transactions to
repurchase 125,000 of the 27,484,346 Common Shares had not yet settled. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has reduced the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding by this amount and recorded a liability of $4.6 million included in
other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

The equity positions of various individuals and entities that
contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units, as well as the equity positions of the holders of LTIP Units, are collectively referred to as the “Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership”.
Subject to certain exceptions (including the “book-up” requirements of LTIP Units), the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their Units with EQR for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. The carrying
value of the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership is based on the proportional relationship between the carrying values of equity associated with EQR’s Common Shares relative to that of the Noncontrolling Interests –
Operating Partnership. Net income is allocated to the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership based on the weighted average ownership percentage during the period.

A portion of the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership Units are classified as mezzanine equity as they do not meet the
requirements for permanent equity classification. The Operating Partnership has the right but not the obligation to make a cash payment to any and all holders of Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership Units requesting an exchange from
EQR. Once the Operating Partnership elects not to redeem the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership Units for cash, EQR is obligated to deliver EQR Common Shares to the exchanging holder of the Noncontrolling Interests –
Operating Partnership Units. If EQR is required, either by contract or securities law, to deliver registered EQR Common Shares, such Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership are differentiated and referred to as “Redeemable
Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership”. Instruments that require settlement in registered shares can not be classified in permanent equity as it is not always completely within an issuer’s control to deliver registered
shares. Therefore, settlement in cash is assumed and that responsibility for settlement in cash is deemed to fall to the Operating Partnership as the primary source of cash for EQR, resulting in presentation in the mezzanine section of the balance
sheet. The Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership are adjusted to the greater of carrying value or fair market

F-20


value based on the Common Share price of EQR at the end of each respective reporting period. EQR has the ability to deliver unregistered EQR Common Shares for the remaining portion of the
Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership Units that are classified in permanent equity at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The carrying value of the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership is allocated based on the number of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership Units in
proportion to the number of Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership Units in total. Such percentage of the total carrying value of Units which is ascribed to the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership is then
adjusted to the greater of carrying value or fair market value as described above. As of December 31, 2009, the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership have a redemption value of approximately $258.3 million, which
represents the value of EQR Common Shares that would be issued in exchange with the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership Units.

The following table presents the changes in the redemption value of the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively (amounts in thousands):

Net proceeds from the Company’s Common Share and Preferred Share (see definition below) offerings are
contributed by the Company to the Operating Partnership. In return for those contributions, EQR receives a number of OP Units in the Operating Partnership equal to the number of Common Shares it has issued in the equity offering (or in the case of a
preferred equity offering, a number of preference units in the Operating Partnership equal in number and having the same terms as the Preferred Shares issued in the equity offering). As a result, the net offering proceeds from Common Shares and
Preferred Shares are allocated between shareholders’ equity and Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership to account for the change in their respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

The Company’s declaration of trust authorizes the Company to issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares of beneficial
interest, $0.01 par value per share (the “Preferred Shares”), with specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board of Trustees may determine, which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the rights of
holders of the Company’s Common Shares.

The following table presents the Company’s issued and outstanding Preferred
Shares as of December 31, 2009 and 2008:

F-21


(1)

redemption price equal to the liquidation price per share, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any.

(2)

On or after the redemption date, convertible preferred shares (Series E & H) may be redeemed under certain circumstances at the option of the Company for cash (in
the case of Series E) or Common Shares (in the case of Series H), in whole or in part, at various redemption prices per share based upon the contractual conversion rate, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any.

(3)

Dividends on all series of Preferred Shares are payable quarterly at various pay dates. The dividend listed for Series N is a Preferred Share rate and the equivalent
Depositary Share annual dividend is $1.62 per share.

(4)

share.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company redeemed for cash all 700,000 shares of its
8.60% Series D Preferred Shares with a liquidation value of $175.0 million. The Company recorded the write-off of approximately $6.1 million in original issuance costs as a premium on redemption of Preferred Shares in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company issued an irrevocable notice to redeem
for cash all 230,000 units of its 7.625% Series J Preference Interests with a liquidation value of $11.5 million. This notice triggered the holder’s accelerated conversion right, which they exercised. As a result, the 230,000 units were
converted into 324,484 Common Shares.

The following table presents the Operating Partnership’s issued and outstanding
Junior Convertible Preference Units (the “Junior Preference Units”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008:

The floating interest rate is based on the 7-Day Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (“SIFMA”) rate, which is the tax-exempt index
equivalent of LIBOR. The interest rate is 0.27% and 0.75% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The
Company’s unsecured public debt contains certain financial and operating covenants including, among other things, maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years
ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

As of December 31, 2009, an unlimited amount of debt securities remains available
for issuance by the Operating Partnership under a registration statement that became automatically effective upon filing with the SEC in December 2008 (under SEC regulations enacted in 2005, the registration statement automatically expires on
December 21, 2011 and does not contain a maximum issuance amount).

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the
Company:

•

Repurchased at par $105.2 million of its 4.75% fixed rate public notes due June 15, 2009 pursuant to a cash tender offer announced on
January 16, 2009 and wrote-off approximately $79,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs and approximately $46,000 of unamortized discounts on notes payable;

•

Repaid $130.0 million of fixed rate private notes at maturity.

On October 11, 2007, the Operating Partnership closed on a $500.0 million senior unsecured term loan. The loan matures on
October 5, 2010, subject to two one-year extension options exercisable by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $250.0 million under certain circumstances.
Advances under the loan bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR plus a spread (currently 0.50%) dependent upon the current credit rating on the Operating Partnership’s long-term senior unsecured debt. EQR has guaranteed the Operating
Partnership’s term loan up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the loan.

On August 23, 2006, the
Operating Partnership issued $650.0 million of exchangeable senior notes that mature on August 15, 2026. Following the repurchases discussed above, the notes had a face value of $482.5 million at December 31, 2009. The notes bear interest
at a fixed rate of 3.85%. The notes are exchangeable into EQR Common Shares, at the option of the holders, under specific circumstances or on or after August 15, 2025, at an initial exchange rate of 16.3934 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of $61.00 per share). The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including upon an increase in the Company’s dividend rate. Upon an exchange of the notes, the
Operating Partnership will settle any amounts up to the principal amount of the notes in cash and the remaining exchange value, if any, will be settled, at the Operating Partnership’s option, in cash, EQR Common Shares or a combination of both.
See Note 2 for more information on the change in the recognition of interest expense for the exchangeable senior notes.

On or
after August 18, 2011, the Operating Partnership may redeem the notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Upon notice of redemption by the Operating Partnership, the
holders may elect to exercise their exchange rights. In addition, on August 18, 2011, August 15, 2016 and August 15, 2021 or following the occurrence of certain change in control transactions prior to August 18, 2011, note
holders may require the Operating Partnership to repurchase the notes for an amount equal to the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

Note holders may also require an exchange of the notes should the closing sale price of Common Shares exceed 130% of the exchange price for
a certain period of time or should the trading price on the notes be less than 98% of the product of the closing sales price of Common Shares multiplied by the applicable exchange rate for a certain period of time.

Aggregate payments of principal on unsecured notes payable for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows (amounts in
thousands):

(1)

Principal payments on unsecured notes include amortization of any discounts or premiums related to the notes. Premiums and discounts are amortized over the life of the
unsecured notes.

F-28


(2)

Includes the $500.0 million term loan, which matures on October 5, 2010, subject to two one-year extension options exercisable by the Operating Partnership.

(3)

Includes $482.5 million face value of 3.85% convertible unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2026.

10. Lines of Credit

The
Operating Partnership has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on February 28, 2012, with the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $500.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or
obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. Advances under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest periods plus a spread (currently 0.50%) dependent upon the Operating
Partnership’s credit rating or based on bids received from the lending group. EQR has guaranteed the Operating Partnership’s credit facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, one of the providers of the Operating Partnership’s unsecured revolving credit facility
declared bankruptcy. Under the existing terms of the credit facility, the provider’s share is up to $75.0 million of potential borrowings. As a result, the Operating Partnership’s borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit
facility has, in essence, been permanently reduced to $1.425 billion of potential borrowings. The obligation to fund by all of the other providers has not changed.

As of December 31, 2009, the amount available on the credit facility was $1.37 billion (net of $56.7 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million
discussed above). The Company did not draw and had no balance outstanding on its revolving credit facility at any time during the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the amount available on the credit facility was $1.29
billion (net of $130.0 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed above). During the year ended December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate was 4.31%.

11. Derivative and Other Fair Value Instruments

The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its
financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors
relevant to the financial instruments.

The carrying values of the Company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes
were approximately $4.8 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The fair values of the Company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, at
December 31, 2009. The carrying values of the Company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately $5.0 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The fair values of the Company’s mortgage
notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately $5.0 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments, other than mortgage notes payable, unsecured notes, derivative
instruments and investment securities, including cash and cash equivalents, lines of credit and other financial instruments, approximate their carrying or contract values.

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to limit these risks by
following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.

The following table summarizes the Company’s consolidated derivative instruments at December 31, 2009 (dollar amounts are in thousands):

F-29


(1)

Fair Value Hedges – Convert outstanding fixed rate debt to a floating interest rate.

(2)

Forward Starting Swaps – Designed to partially fix the interest rate in advance of a planned future debt issuance. These swaps have mandatory counterparty
terminations in 2012, 2013 and 2014.

(3)

Development Cash Flow Hedges – Convert outstanding floating rate debt to a fixed interest rate.

The following tables provide the location of the Company’s derivative instruments within the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets
and their fair market values as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (amounts in thousands):

The following tables provide a summary of the effect of fair value hedges on the Company’s accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (amounts in thousands):

F-30


The following tables provide a summary of the effect of cash flow hedges on the
Company’s accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (amounts in thousands):

As of December 31, 2009, there were approximately $4.2 million in deferred gains, net, included in
accumulated other comprehensive income. Based on the estimated fair values of the net derivative instruments at December 31, 2009, the Company may recognize an estimated $5.8 million of accumulated other comprehensive income as additional
interest expense during the year ending December 31, 2010.

In January 2009, the Company received approximately $0.4
million to terminate a fair value hedge of interest rates in conjunction with the public tender of the Company’s 4.75% fixed rate public notes due June 15, 2009. Approximately $0.2 million of the settlement received was deferred and
recognized as a reduction of interest expense through the maturity on June 15, 2009.

In April and May 2009, the Company
received approximately $10.8 million to terminate six treasury locks in conjunction with the issuance of a $500.0 million 11-year mortgage loan. The entire amount was deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is
recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the first ten years of the mortgage loan.

In February 2008, the Company
paid approximately $13.2 million to terminate three forward starting swaps in conjunction with the issuance of a $500.0 million 11.5-year mortgage loan. The entire amount was deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and is
recognized as an increase to interest expense over the first ten years of the mortgage loan.

In November 2008, the Company
paid approximately $13.5 million to terminate six forward starting swaps in conjunction with the issuance of a $543.0 million 8-year mortgage loan. Approximately $13.1 million of the settlement payment was deferred as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive loss and is recognized as an increase to interest expense over the life of the underlying hedged item.

The Company has invested in various investment securities in an effort to increase the amounts earned on the significant amount of unrestricted cash on hand throughout 2008 and 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
sold a majority of its investment securities, receiving proceeds of approximately $215.8 million, and recorded a $4.9 million realized gain on sale (specific identification) which is included in interest and other income. The following tables set
forth the maturity, amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, book/fair value and interest and other income of the various investment securities held as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (amounts in thousands):

F-31


A three-level valuation hierarchy exists for
disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy
is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:

•

Level 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

•

Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

The Company’s derivative positions are valued using models developed by the respective counterparty as well as models developed
internally by the Company that use as their basis readily observable market parameters (such as forward yield curves and credit default swap data) and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. In addition, employee holdings other
than EQR Common Shares within the supplemental executive retirement plan (the “SERP”) have a fair value of $61.1 million as of December 31, 2009 and are included in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
These SERP investments are valued using quoted market prices for identical assets and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

The Company’s investment securities are valued using quoted market prices or readily available market interest rate data. The quoted market prices are classified within Level 1 of the valuation
hierarchy and the market interest rate data are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership are valued using the quoted market price of EQR Common Shares and are classified
within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

The Company’s real estate asset impairment charge was the result of an
analysis of the parcel’s fair value (determined using internally developed models that were based on market assumptions and comparable sales data) (Level

F-32


3) compared to its current capitalized carrying value. The valuation technique used to measure fair value is consistent with how similar assets were measured in prior periods. See Note 19 for
further discussion.

12. Earnings Per Share

The following tables set forth the computation of net income per share – basic and net income per share – diluted (amounts in thousands except per share amounts):

Potential common shares issuable from the assumed conversion of OP Units and the exercise/vesting of
long-term compensation award shares/units are automatically anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as the Company had a loss from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively.

F-33


Convertible preferred shares/units that could be converted into 402,501, 427,090 and
652,534 weighted average Common Shares for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive. In
addition, the effect of the Common Shares that could ultimately be issued upon the conversion/exchange of the Operating Partnership’s $650.0 million ($482.5 million outstanding at December 31, 2009) exchangeable senior notes was not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive.

For additional
disclosures regarding the employee share options and restricted shares, see Notes 2 and 14.

13. Discontinued Operations

The Company has presented separately as discontinued operations in all periods the results of operations for all consolidated assets disposed
of, all operations related to active condominium conversion properties effective upon their respective transfer into a TRS and all properties held for sale, if any.

The components of discontinued operations are outlined below and include the results of operations for the respective periods that the Company owned such assets during each of the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (amounts in thousands).

(1)

Includes expenses paid in the current period for properties sold or held for sale in prior periods related to the Company’s period of ownership.

(2)

Includes only interest expense specific to secured mortgage notes payable for properties sold and/or held for sale.

For the properties sold during 2009 (excluding condominium conversion properties), the investment in real estate, net of accumulated
depreciation, and the mortgage notes payable balances at December 31, 2008 were $572.5 million and $38.9 million, respectively.

The net real estate basis of the Company’s active condominium conversion properties owned by the TRS and included in discontinued operations (excludes the Company’s halted conversions as they are now held for use), which were
included in investment in real estate, net in the consolidated balance sheets, was $0.8 million and $12.6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

F-34


14. Share Incentive Plans

On May 15, 2002, the shareholders of EQR approved the Company’s 2002 Share Incentive Plan. The maximum aggregate number of awards
that may be granted under this plan may not exceed 7.5% of the Company’s outstanding Common Shares calculated on a “fully diluted” basis and determined annually on the first day of each calendar year. As of January 1, 2010, this
amount equaled 22,091,629, of which 6,295,992 shares were available for future issuance. No awards may be granted under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan, as restated, after February 20, 2012.

Pursuant to the 2002 Share Incentive Plan, as restated, and the Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan, as amended
(collectively the “Share Incentive Plans”), officers, trustees and key employees of the Company may be granted share options to acquire Common Shares (“Options”) including non-qualified share options (“NQSOs”),
incentive share options (“ISOs”) and share appreciation rights (“SARs”), or may be granted restricted or non-restricted shares, subject to conditions and restrictions as described in the Share Incentive Plans. In addition, each
year prior to 2007, certain executive officers of the Company participated in the Company’s performance-based restricted share plan. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company elected to discontinue the award of new performance-based award
grants. Options, SARs, restricted shares, performance shares and LTIP Units (see discussion below) are sometimes collectively referred to herein as “Awards”.

The Options are generally granted at the fair market value of the Company’s Common Shares at the date of grant, vest in three equal installments over a three-year period, are exercisable upon vesting
and expire ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all Options under the Share Incentive Plans is equal to the fair market value of the underlying Common Shares at the time the Option is granted. Options exercised result in new
Common Shares being issued on the open market. The Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan, as amended, will terminate at such time as all outstanding Awards have expired or have been exercised/vested. The Board of Trustees may
at any time amend or terminate the Share Incentive Plans, but termination will not affect Awards previously granted. Any Options which had vested prior to such a termination would remain exercisable by the holder.

Restricted shares that have been awarded through December 31, 2009 generally vest three years from the award date. In addition, the
Company’s unvested restricted shareholders have the same voting rights as any other Common Share holder. During the three-year period of restriction, the Company’s unvested restricted shareholders receive quarterly dividend payments on
their shares at the same rate and on the same date as any other Common Share holder. As a result, dividends paid on unvested restricted shares are included as a component of retained earnings and have not been considered in reducing net income
available to Common Shares in a manner similar to the Company’s preferred share dividends for the earnings per share calculation. If employment is terminated prior to the lapsing of the restriction, the shares are generally canceled.

In December 2008, the Company’s 2002 Share Incentive Plan was amended to allow for the issuance of long-term incentive
plan units (“LTIP Units”) to officers of the Company as an alternative to the Company’s restricted shares. LTIP Units are a class of partnership interests that under certain conditions, including vesting, are convertible by the holder
into an equal number of OP Units, which are redeemable by the holder for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis or the cash value of such shares at the option of the Company. In connection with the February 2009 grant of long-term incentive
compensation for services provided during 2008, officers of the Company were allowed to choose, on a one-for-one basis, between restricted shares and LTIP Units. Similar to restricted shares, LTIP Units generally vest three years from the award
date. In addition, LTIP Unit holders receive quarterly dividend payments on their LTIP Units at the same rate and on the same date as any other OP Unit holder. As a result, dividends paid on LTIP Units are included as a component of Noncontrolling
Interests – Operating Partnership and have not been considered in reducing net income available to Common Shares in a manner similar to the Company’s preferred share dividends for the earnings per share calculation. If employment is
terminated prior to vesting, the LTIP Units are generally canceled. An LTIP Unit will automatically convert to an OP Unit when the capital account of each LTIP Unit increases (“books-up”) to a specified target. If the capital target is not
attained within ten years following the date of issuance, the LTIP Unit will automatically be canceled and no compensation will be payable to the holder of such canceled LTIP Unit.

The Company’s Share Incentive Plans provide for certain benefits upon retirement at or after age 62. As of November 4, 2008, but
effective as of January 1, 2009, the Company changed the definition of retirement for employees (including all officers but not non-employee members of the Company’s Board of Trustees) under its Share Incentive Plans. For employees hired
prior to January 1, 2009, retirement generally will mean the termination of employment (other than for cause): (i) on or after age 62; or (ii) prior to age 62 after meeting the requirements of the Rule of 70 (described below). For
employees hired after January 1, 2009, retirement generally will mean the termination of employment (other than for cause) after meeting the requirements of the Rule of 70.

The Rule of 70 is met when an employee’s years of service with the Company (which must be at least 15 years) plus his or her age (which
must be at least 55 years) on the date of termination equals or exceeds 70 years. In addition,

F-35


the employee must give the Company at least 6 months’ advance written notice of his or her intention to retire and sign a release upon termination of employment, releasing the Company from
customary claims and agreeing to ongoing non-competition and employee non-solicitation provisions. John Powers, Executive Vice President – Human Resources, became eligible for retirement in 2009 as he turned 62. Frederick C. Tuomi, President
– Property Management, became eligible for retirement under the Rule of 70 in 2009. The following executive officers of the Company will become eligible for retirement under the Rule of 70 in the next two years: Bruce C. Strohm, Executive Vice
President and General Counsel – 2010 and David J. Neithercut, Chief Executive Officer and President – 2011.

For
employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, who retire at or after age 62, such employee’s unvested restricted shares and share options would immediately vest, and share options would continue to be exercisable for the balance of the
applicable ten-year option period, as was provided under the Share Incentive Plans prior to the adoption of the Rule of 70. For all other employees (those hired after January 1, 2009 and those hired before such date who choose to retire prior
to age 62), upon such retirement under the new definition of retirement of employees, such employee’s unvested restricted shares and share options would continue to vest per the original vesting schedule (subject to immediate vesting upon the
occurrence of a subsequent change in control of the Company or the employee’s death), and options would continue to be exercisable for the balance of the applicable ten-year option period, subject to the employee’s compliance with the
non-competition and employee non-solicitation provisions. If an employee violates these provisions after such retirement, all unvested restricted shares and unvested and vested share options at the time of the violation would be void, unless
otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Trustees.

The following tables summarize
compensation information regarding the performance shares, restricted shares, LTIP Units, share options and Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) for the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (amounts in thousands):

Compensation expense is generally recognized for
Awards as follows:

•

Restricted shares, LTIP Units and share options – Straight-line method over the vesting period of the options or shares regardless of cliff or
ratable vesting distinctions.

F-36


•

Performance shares – Accelerated method with each vesting tranche valued as a separate award, with a separate vesting date, consistent with the
estimated value of the award at each period end.

•

ESPP discount – Immediately upon the purchase of common shares each quarter.

The Company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for all Awards for those individuals approaching or meeting the retirement
age criteria discussed above. The total compensation expense related to Awards not yet vested at December 31, 2009 is $18.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average term of 1.3 years.

See Note 2 for additional information regarding the Company’s share-based compensation.

The table below summarizes the Award activity of the Share Incentive Plans for the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

(1)

The weighted average grant date fair value for Options granted during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $3.38 per share, $4.08 per share and
$6.26 per share, respectively.

(2)

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $2.8 million, $15.6 million and $13.7 million,
respectively. These values were calculated as the difference between the strike price of the underlying awards and the per share price at which each respective award was exercised.

(3)

The fair value of restricted shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $8.0 million, $23.9 million and $25.5 million, respectively.

The following table summarizes information regarding options outstanding and exercisable at December 31,
2009:

F-37


(1)

The aggregate intrinsic value of both options outstanding and options vested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2009 is $49.9 million.

(2)

The aggregate intrinsic value and weighted average remaining contractual life in years of options exercisable as of December 31, 2009 is $29.3 million and 4.3
years, respectively.

Note: The aggregate intrinsic values in Notes (1) and (2) above were both
calculated as the excess, if any, between the Company’s closing share price of $33.78 per share on December 31, 2009 and the strike price of the underlying awards.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, 7,522,344 Options (with a weighted average exercise price of $31.58) and 7,000,222 Options (with a
weighted average exercise price of $28.45) were exercisable, respectively.

15. Employee Plans

The Company established an Employee Share Purchase Plan to provide each employee and trustee the ability to annually acquire up to $100,000
of Common Shares of the Company. In 2003, the Company’s shareholders approved an increase in the aggregate number of Common Shares available under the ESPP to 7,000,000 (from 2,000,000). The Company has 3,561,333 Common Shares available for
purchase under the ESPP at December 31, 2009. The Common Shares may be purchased quarterly at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a share on the last day of such quarter; and (b) the greater of:
(i) the closing price for a share on the first day of such quarter, and (ii) the average closing price for a share for all the business days in the quarter. The following table summarizes information regarding the Common Shares issued
under the ESPP:

The Company
established a defined contribution plan (the “401(k) Plan”) to provide retirement benefits for employees that meet minimum employment criteria. The Company matches dollar for dollar up to the first 3% of eligible compensation that a
participant contributes to the 401(k) Plan. Participants are vested in the Company’s contributions over five years. The Company recognized an expense in the amount of $3.5 million, $3.8 million and $4.2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company may also elect to make an annual discretionary
profit-sharing contribution as a percentage of each individual employee’s eligible compensation under the 401(k) Plan. The Company did not make a contribution for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and as such, no expense was
recognized in either year. The Company recognized an expense of approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

F-38


The Company established a supplemental executive retirement plan (the “SERP”) to
provide certain officers and trustees an opportunity to defer a portion of their eligible compensation in order to save for retirement. The SERP is restricted to investments in Company Common Shares, certain marketable securities that have been
specifically approved and cash equivalents. The deferred compensation liability represented in the SERP and the securities issued to fund such deferred compensation liability are consolidated by the Company and carried on the Company’s balance
sheet, and the Company’s Common Shares held in the SERP are accounted for as a reduction to paid in capital.

16. Distribution
Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan

On November 3, 1997, the Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3 Registration
Statement to register 14,000,000 Common Shares pursuant to a Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (the “DRIP Plan”). The registration statement was declared effective on November 25, 1997. The remaining shares available
for issuance under the 1997 registration lapsed in December 2008.

On December 16, 2008, the Company filed with the SEC a
Form S-3 Registration Statement to register 5,000,000 Common Shares under the DRIP Plan. The registration statement was automatically declared effective the same day and expires at the earlier of the date in which all 5,000,000 shares have been
issued or December 15, 2011. The Company has 4,932,533 Common Shares available for issuance under the DRIP Plan at December 31, 2009.

The DRIP Plan provides holders of record and beneficial owners of Common Shares and Preferred Shares with a simple and convenient method of investing cash distributions in additional Common Shares (which
is referred to herein as the “Dividend Reinvestment – DRIP Plan”). Common Shares may also be purchased on a monthly basis with optional cash payments made by participants in the DRIP Plan and interested new investors, not currently
shareholders of the Company, at the market price of the Common Shares less a discount ranging between 0% and 5%, as determined in accordance with the DRIP Plan (which is referred to herein as the “Share Purchase – DRIP Plan”). Common
Shares purchased under the DRIP Plan may, at the option of the Company, be directly issued by the Company or purchased by the Company’s transfer agent in the open market using participants’ funds.

17. Transactions with Related Parties

The Company provided asset and property management services to certain related entities for properties not owned by the Company, which terminated in December 2008. Fees received for providing such
services were approximately $0.3 million for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

The Company leases its
corporate headquarters from an entity controlled by EQR’s Chairman of the Board of Trustees. The lease terminates on July 31, 2011. Amounts incurred for such office space for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, were approximately $3.0 million, $2.9 million and $2.9 million. The Company believes these amounts equal market rates for such rental space.

18. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company, as an owner of real estate,
is subject to various Federal, state and local environmental laws. Compliance by the Company with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on the Company. However, the Company cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or
regulations on its current properties or on properties that it may acquire in the future.

The Company is party to a housing
discrimination lawsuit brought by a non-profit civil rights organization in April 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The suit alleges that the Company designed and built approximately 300 of its properties in violation of
the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act and Americans With Disabilities Act. The suit seeks actual and punitive damages, injunctive relief (including modification of non-compliant properties), costs and attorneys’ fees. The
Company believes it has a number of viable defenses, including that a majority of the named properties were completed before the operative dates of the statutes in question and/or were not designed or built by the Company. Accordingly, the Company
is defending the suit vigorously. Due to the pendency of the Company’s defenses and the uncertainty of many other critical factual and legal issues, it is not possible to determine or predict the outcome of the suit and as a result, no amounts
have been accrued at December 31, 2009. While no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe that the suit, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company does not believe there is any other litigation pending or threatened against it that, individually or in the aggregate, may
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

F-39


The Company has established a reserve and recorded a corresponding reduction to its net gain
on sales of discontinued operations related to potential liabilities associated with its condominium conversion activities. The reserve covers potential product liability related to each conversion. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of
the reserve and makes adjustments as necessary. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded additional reserves of approximately $3.3 million (primarily related to an insurance settlement), paid approximately $4.7 million in
claims and released approximately $2.2 million of remaining reserves for settled claims. As a result, the Company had total reserves of approximately $6.7 million at December 31, 2009. While no assurances can be given, the Company does not
believe that the ultimate resolution of these potential liabilities, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company has four projects totaling 1,700 units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30, 2011. Some of the projects
are developed solely by the Company, while others are co-developed with various third party development partners. The development venture agreements with partners are primarily deal-specific, with differing terms regarding profit-sharing, equity
contributions, returns on investment, buy-sell agreements and other customary provisions. The partner is most often the “general” or “managing” partner of the development venture. The typical buy-sell arrangements contain
appraisal rights and provisions that provide the right, but not the obligation, for the Company to acquire the partner’s interest in the project at fair market value upon the expiration of a negotiated time period (typically two to five years
after substantial completion of the project).

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total operating
lease payments incurred for office space, including a portion of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and utilities, and including rent due under three ground leases, aggregated $8.4 million, $8.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively.

The Company has entered into a retirement benefits agreement with its Chairman of the Board of Trustees and deferred compensation
agreements with its Vice Chairman and two former chief executive officers. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2007, the Company recognized compensation expense of $1.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively, related to these
agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reduced compensation expense by $0.4 million related to these agreements.

The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations for minimum rent payments under operating leases and deferred compensation for the next five years and thereafter as of
December 31, 2009:

(a)

Minimum basic rent due for various office space the Company leases and fixed base rent due on ground leases for four properties/parcels.

(b)

Estimated payments to the Company’s Chairman, Vice Chairman and two former CEO’s based on planned retirement dates.

19. Impairment and Other Expenses

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded an approximate $11.1 million non-cash asset impairment charge on a parcel of land held for development. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded
approximately $116.4 million of non-cash asset impairment charges on land held for development related to five potential development projects that will no longer be pursued. These charges were the result of an analysis of each parcel’s
estimated fair value (determined using internally developed models based on market assumptions and comparable sales data) compared to its current capitalized carrying value and management’s decision to reduce the number of planned development
projects the Company will undertake.

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company incurred
charges of $6.5 million, $5.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively, related to the write-off of various pursuit and out-of-pocket costs for terminated acquisition, disposition (including halted condominium conversions) and development transactions
and related to transaction closing costs, such as survey, title and legal fees, on the acquisition of operating properties and are included in other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

20. Reportable Segments

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by senior management. Senior management decides how
resources are allocated and assesses performance on a monthly basis.

The Company’s primary business is owning, managing
and operating multifamily residential properties, which includes the generation of rental and other related income through the leasing of apartment units to residents. Senior management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment communities
individually and geographically, and both on a same store and non-same store basis; however, each of our apartment communities generally has similar economic characteristics, residents, products and services. The Company’s operating segments
have been aggregated by geography in a manner identical to that which is provided to its chief operating decision maker.

The
Company’s fee and asset management, development (including its partially owned properties), condominium conversion and corporate housing (Equity Corporate Housing or “ECH”) activities are immaterial and do not individually meet the
threshold requirements of a reportable segment and as such, have been aggregated in the “Other” segment in the tables presented below.

All revenues are from external customers and there is no customer who contributed 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, or 2007.

The primary financial measure for the Company’s rental real estate properties is net operating income (“NOI”),
which represents rental income less: 1) property and maintenance expense; 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense; and 3) property management expense (all as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations). The Company
believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company’s apartment communities. Current year NOI is
compared to prior year NOI and current year budgeted NOI as a measure of financial performance. The following tables present NOI for each segment from our rental real estate specific to continuing operations for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as well as total assets for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (amounts in thousands):

(1)

Same store includes properties owned for all of both 2009 and 2008 which represented 113,598 units.

(2)

Non-same store includes properties acquired after January 1, 2008.

(3)

Other includes ECH, development, condominium conversion overhead of $1.4 million and other corporate operations. Also reflects a $9.6 million elimination of rental
income recorded in Northeast, Northwest, Southeast and Southwest operating segments related to ECH.

The Company recorded a reduction to general and administrative expense of approximately $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 due to the successful resolution of a certain lawsuit in Florida, resulting in the reversal of
the majority of a previously established litigation reserve. The Company had previously recorded a reduction to general and administrative expense of approximately $2.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 due to the recovery of
insurance proceeds related to the same lawsuit.

its 7.075% ownership interest in Wellsford Park Highlands Corporation (“WPHC”), an entity which owns a condominium development in Denver, Colorado. The Company recorded a gain of approximately $0.7 million as income from investments in
unconsolidated entities and has no further ownership interest in WPHC.
