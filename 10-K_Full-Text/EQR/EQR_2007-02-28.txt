EQUITY RESIDENTIAL



Item 1.  Business

General

Equity
Residential (“EQR”), a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in
March 1993, is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition,
development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United
States growth markets.  EQR has elected
to be taxed as a REIT.

The Company is one of the
largest publicly traded real estate companies and is the largest publicly
traded owner of multifamily properties (based on the aggregate market value of
its outstanding Common Shares, the number of apartment units wholly owned and
total revenues earned).  The Company’s
corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also operates
approximately thirty-five property management offices throughout the United
States.

EQR
is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2006 owned an
approximate 93.6% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an
Illinois limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).  The Company is structured as an umbrella
partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), under which all property ownership and business
operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its
subsidiaries.  References to the “Company”
include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled
by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.

As
of December 31, 2006, the Company, directly or indirectly through
investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of 617

properties in 25 states and the District of Columbia
consisting of 165,716 units.  The
ownership breakdown includes (table does not include various uncompleted
development properties):

As of February 7,
2007, the Company has approximately 5,200 employees who provide real estate
operations, leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition,
development and other support functions.

Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current
Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to any of those reports we file

Business Objectives and
Operating Strategies

The
Company seeks to maximize current income, capital appreciation of each property
and the total return for its shareholders. 
The Company’s strategy for accomplishing these objectives includes:


•

Leveraging our size and scale in four
critical ways:

•

Investing in apartment communities located in
strategically targeted markets, to maximize our total return on an enterprise
level;

•

Meeting the needs of our residents by
offering a wide array of product choices and a commitment to service;

•

Engaging, retaining, and attracting the best
people by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to
succeed; and

•

Sharing resources, customers and best
practices in property management and across the enterprise.

•

Owning a highly diversified portfolio by
investing in target markets defined by a combination of the following criteria:

•

High barrier-to-entry (low supply);

•

Strong economic predictors (high demand); and

•

Attractive quality of life (high demand and
retention).

•

Giving residents reasons to stay with the
Company by providing a range of product options available in our diversified
portfolio and by enhancing their experience through our employees and our
services.

•

Being open and responsive to market realities
to take advantage of investment opportunities that align with our long-term
vision.

Acquisition, Development and
Disposition Strategies

The
Company anticipates that future property acquisitions, developments and
dispositions will occur within the United States.  Acquisitions and developments may be financed
from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance
of additional equity and debt securities, sales of properties, joint venture
agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings.  In addition, the Company may acquire
properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership
interests in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”) as consideration for the
acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable
the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or
gain that might otherwise result from the sales.  In addition, EQR may acquire or develop
multifamily properties specifically to convert directly into condominiums as
well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual condominiums.  EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold
and/or sell based on market opportunities.

When
evaluating potential acquisitions, developments and dispositions, the Company
generally considers the following factors:

•

strategically targeted markets;

•

income levels and employment growth trends in
the relevant market;

•

employment and household growth and net
migration of the relevant market’s population;

•

barriers to entry that would limit
competition (zoning laws, building permit availability, supply of undeveloped
or developable real estate, local building costs and construction costs, among
other factors);

•

the location, construction quality, condition
and design of the property;

•

the current and projected cash flow of the
property and the ability to increase cash flow;

•

the potential for capital appreciation of the
property;

•

the terms of resident leases, including the
potential for rent increases;

•

the potential for economic growth and the tax
and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located;


•

the occupancy and demand by residents for
properties of a similar type in the vicinity (the overall market and
submarket);

•

the prospects for liquidity through sale,
financing or refinancing of the property;

•

the benefits of integration into existing
operations;

•

purchase prices and yields of available existing
stabilized properties, if any;

•

competition from existing multifamily
properties, residential properties under development and the potential for the
construction of new multifamily properties in the area; and

•

opportunistic selling based on demand and
price of high quality assets, including condominium conversions.

The Company generally
reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve
its acquisition and development strategies. 
In addition, when feasible, the Company may structure these transactions
as tax-deferred exchanges.

Credit Facilities

The
Operating Partnership has an unsecured revolving credit facility with potential
borrowings of up to $1.0 billion maturing on May 29, 2008, with the
ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $500.0 million under
certain circumstances.  Advances under
the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various
interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s
credit rating or based on bids received from the lending group.  EQR has guaranteed the Operating Partnership’s
credit facility up to the maximum amount and for its full term.

On
August 30, 2005, the Operating Partnership entered into a one-year $600.0
million revolving credit facility maturing on August 29, 2006.  This credit facility was repaid in full and
terminated on January 20, 2006.

On

million revolving credit facility maturing on July 6, 2007.  This facility was repaid in full and
terminated on October 13, 2006. 
Advances under this facility bore interest at variable rates based on
LIBOR at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the Operating
Partnership’s credit rating.  EQR
guaranteed this credit facility up to the maximum amount and for its full term.


As
of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, $460.0 million and $769.0
million, respectively, was outstanding and $69.3 million and $50.2 million,
respectively, was restricted (dedicated to support letters of credit and not
available for borrowing) on the credit facilities.  During the years ended December 31, 2006
and 2005, the weighted average interest rate under the credit facilities were 5.40%
and 3.80%, respectively.

Competition

All
of the Company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other
multifamily properties.  The number of
competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material
effect on the Company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any
newly acquired properties and on the rents charged.  The Company may be competing with other
entities that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have
more experience than the Company’s managers. 
In addition, other forms of rental properties and single-family housing
provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily
properties.  See Item 1A Risk Factors for
additional information with respect to competition.

Environmental
Considerations

See
Item 1A Risk Factors for information concerning the potential effects of
environmental regulations on our operations.

Item
1A.  Risk Factors

General

The following Risk Factors
may contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other
sections of this report.  Unless
otherwise indicated, when used in this section, the terms “we” and “us” refer
to Equity Residential and its subsidiaries, including ERP Operating Limited
Partnership.

The
occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could
adversely affect, possibly in a material manner, our business, financial
condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect the value of our
common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest
(which we refer to collectively as “Shares”); preference interests (“Interests”)
of a subsidiary of ERP Operating Limited Partnership, our operating partnership;
and limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”).  In this section, we refer to the Shares,
Interests, Units and the OP Units together as our “securities”, and the
investors who own Shares, Interests, Units and/or OP Units as our “security
holders”.

Our Performance and Securities
Value are Subject to Risks Associated with the Real Estate Industry

General

Real
property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively
illiquid. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and
value of our properties.  These factors
include changes in the national, regional and local economic climates, local
conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in
demand for our multifamily properties, the attractiveness of our properties to
residents, competition from other available multifamily property owners and
changes in market rental rates.  Our
performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to
pay for adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including
real estate taxes, which could increase over time.  Also, the expenses of owning and operating a
property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors
and competition cause a reduction in income from the property.


We May Be
Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Units as Leases Expire

When
our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be
able to relet their units.  Even if the
residents do renew or we can relet the units, the terms of renewal or reletting
may be less favorable than current lease terms. 
Because virtually all of our leases are for apartments, they are
generally for terms of no more than one year. 
If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units, or if
the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than
expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition will be
adversely affected.  Consequently, our
cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security
holders would be reduced.

New
Acquisitions, Developments and/or Condominium Conversion Projects May Fail
to Perform as Expected and Competition for Acquisitions May Result in
Increased Prices for Properties

We
intend to actively acquire and develop multifamily properties for rental
operations and/or conversion into condominiums, as well as upgrade and sell
existing properties as individual condominiums. We may underestimate the costs
necessary to bring an acquired or development property up to standards
established for its intended market position. 
Additionally, we expect that other major real estate investors with
significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment
opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our
development efforts.  This competition
may increase prices for multifamily properties or decrease the price at which we
expect to sell individual properties.  We
may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable
property acquisitions on favorable terms.  
We also plan to develop more properties ourselves in addition to
co-investing with our development partners for either the rental or condominium
market, depending on opportunities in each sub-market.  This may increase the overall level of risk
associated with our developments.  The
total number of development units, cost of development and estimated completion
dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions
(such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local
government regulation.

Because
Real Estate Investments Are Illiquid, We May Not Be Able to Sell
Properties When Appropriate

Real
estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly.  We may not be able to reconfigure our
portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions.  This inability to respond promptly to changes
in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial
condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders.

Changes
in Laws and Litigation Risk Could Affect Our Business

We
are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases
real estate or other federal, state or local taxes.  Consequently, any such tax increases may
adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make
distributions to our security holders. 
Similarly, changes that increase our potential liability under
environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance would
adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our
securities.

We
may become involved in legal proceedings, including but not limited to, proceedings
related to consumer, employment, development, condominium conversion, tort and
commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us, could
result in liability material to our financial condition or results of
operations.

Environmental
Problems Are Possible and Can Be Costly

Federal,
state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate
to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic


substances or petroleum
product releases at such property.  The
owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for
property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties
in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up
responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator
knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants.  Even if more than one person may have been
responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws
may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred.  In addition, third parties may sue the owner
or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental
contamination emanating from that site.

Substantially
all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments
completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies.  These environmental assessments have not
revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that our management
believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Over
the past several years, there have been an increasing number of lawsuits
against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury
and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real
estate.  Some of these lawsuits have
resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements.  Insurance carriers have reacted to these
liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and
pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates.  We have adopted programs designed to minimize
the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for
promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold
might have on residents or the property.

We
cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties
reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of any of our
properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us,
or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any
of our properties.

Insurance Policy
Deductibles and Exclusions

In
order to partially mitigate the substantial increase in insurance costs in
recent years, management has gradually increased deductible and self-insured
retention amounts.  As of December 31,
2006, the Company’s property insurance policy (for Wholly Owned Properties)
provides for a per occurrence deductible of $250,000 and self-insured retention of $5.0 million per occurrence,
subject to a maximum annual aggregate self-insured retention of $7.5 million,
with approximately 90% of any excess losses being covered by insurance.  Any earthquake and named windstorm losses are
subject to a deductible of 5% of the values of the buildings involved in the
losses and are not subject to the aggregate self-insured retention.  The Company’s liability and worker’s compensation
policies at December 31, 2006, provide for a $1.0 million per occurrence
deductible.  These higher deductible and
self-insured retention amounts do expose the Company to greater potential
uninsured losses, such as the property damage caused by hurricanes and other
natural disasters, but management believes the savings in insurance premium
expense justifies this increased exposure over the long-term.

As
a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, property
insurance carriers have created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “all
risk” property insurance policies.  While
separate terrorism insurance coverage is available in certain instances,
premiums for such coverage are generally very expensive and deductibles are
very high.  Additionally, the terrorism
insurance coverage that is available typically excludes coverage for losses
from nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. 
As of December 31, 2006, the Company was insured for $500 million
in terrorism insurance coverage, with a $5.0 million deductible.  In the event of a terrorist attack impacting
one or more of our properties, we could lose the revenues from the property,
our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from
residents or others suffering injuries or losses.  The Company believes, however, that the
number and geographic diversity of its portfolio and its terrorism insurance
coverage help to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with potential
terrorist attacks.


Debt Financing, Preferred
Shares and Preference Interests and Units Could Adversely Affect Our
Performance

General

Please refer to Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

,
for the Company’s total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of December 31,
2006.

In
addition to debt, we have $398.3 million of combined liquidation value of
outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest and preference interests
and units, with a weighted average dividend preference of 7.69% per annum, as
of December 31, 2006.  Our use of
debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks, including the
following:

Scheduled
Debt Payments Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition

In
the future, our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of
principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected
levels.

We
may not be able to refinance existing debt (which in virtually all cases
requires substantial principal payments at maturity) and, if we can, the terms
of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing
indebtedness.  If principal payments due
at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or paid with proceeds of other capital
transactions, such as new equity capital, our cash flow will not be sufficient
in all years to repay all maturing debt. 
As a result, we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary
for the maintenance of our properties and may have to dispose of one or more
properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us.

Please
refer to Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, for the Company’s
debt maturity schedule as of December 31, 2006.

Financial
Covenants Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Financial Condition

If
a property we own is mortgaged to secure debt and we are unable to meet the
mortgage payments, the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property,
resulting in loss of income and asset value. 
Foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance
existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial
condition and results of operations.

The
mortgages on our properties may contain negative covenants that, among other
things, limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further
mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage.  In addition, our unsecured credit facilities
contain certain restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability
to incur debt.  The indentures under
which a substantial portion of our debt was issued also contain certain
financial and operating covenants including, among other things, maintenance of
certain financial ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur
secured and unsecured debt (including acquisition financing), and to sell all
or substantially all of our assets.  Our
credit facilities and indentures are cross-defaulted and also contain cross
default provisions with other material debt. 
Our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively, are (terms are defined in the indentures):


Some of the properties were
financed with tax-exempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or
deed restrictions.  We have retained an
independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive
covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties.  If these bond compliance requirements
restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to attract low or
moderate-income residents, or eligible/qualified residents, then our income
from these properties may be limited.

Our
Degree of Leverage Could Limit Our Ability to Obtain Additional Financing

Our
consolidated debt-to-total market capitalization ratio was 33.0% as of December 31,
2006.  Our degree of leverage could have
important consequences to security holders. 
For example, the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain
additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes, making us more
vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general.

Rising
Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow

Advances
under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at
various interest periods, plus a spread dependent upon the Operating
Partnership’s credit rating, or based upon bids received from the lending group.  Certain public issuances of our senior
unsecured debt instruments may also, from time to time, bear interest at
floating rates.  We may also borrow
additional money with variable interest rates in the future.  Increases in interest rates would increase
our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs
of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt.  Accordingly, higher interest rates could
adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions
to security holders.  We use interest
rate hedging arrangements to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility,
but these arrangements may expose us to additional risks, and no strategy can
completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate
fluctuations.  There can be no assurance
that our hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact and may
involve costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs, if we terminate
them.

We Depend on Our Key
Personnel

We
depend on the efforts of the Chairman of our Board of Trustees, Samuel Zell,
and our executive officers, particularly David J. Neithercut, our President and
Chief Executive Officer and Gerald A. Spector, our Chief Operating
Officer.  If they resign or otherwise
cease to be employed by us, our operations could be temporarily adversely affected.  Mr. Zell has entered into executive
compensation and retirement benefit agreements with the Company.  Mr. Spector has entered into a Deferred
Compensation Agreement with the Company that under certain conditions could
provide him with a salary benefit after his termination of employment with the
Company.  In addition, Mr. Zell and Mr. Spector
have entered into Noncompetition Agreements with the Company.


In
the event the Chairman of the Board and/or the CEO are unable to serve, (i) the
Lead Trustee will automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor
to the Chairman, (ii) the Chairman will automatically be appointed to
serve as the interim successor to the CEO and (iii) the Chair of the
Compensation Committee of the Board will immediately call a meeting of the
Committee to recommend to the full Board the selection of a permanent replacement
for either or both positions, as necessary.

Control and Influence by
Significant Shareholders Could Be Exercised in a Manner Adverse to Other
Shareholders

The
consent of certain affiliates of Mr. Zell is required for certain
amendments to the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership
of the Operating Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”).  As a result of their security ownership and
rights concerning amendments to the Partnership Agreement, the security holders
referred to herein may have influence over the Company.  Although these security holders have not
agreed to act together on any matter, they would be in a position to exercise
even more influence over the Company’s affairs if they were to act together in
the future.  This influence could
conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of
other security holders.  For additional
information regarding the security ownership of our trustees, including Mr. Zell,
and our executive officers, see the Company’s definitive proxy statement.

Shareholders’ Ability to
Effect Changes in Control of the Company is Limited

Provisions
of Our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws Could Inhibit Changes in Control

Certain
provisions of our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws may delay or prevent a change
in control of the Company or other transactions that could provide the security
holders with a premium over the then-prevailing market price of their
securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security
holders.  This includes the 5% Ownership
Limit described below.  Also, any future
series of preferred shares of beneficial interest may have certain voting
provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or other
transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders.

We Have
a Share Ownership Limit for REIT Tax Purposes

To
remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50%
in value of our outstanding Shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by
five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year.  To facilitate maintenance of our REIT
qualification, our Declaration of Trust, subject to certain exceptions,
prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5% of the lesser of
the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred
shares.  We refer to this restriction as
the “Ownership Limit.”  Absent any
exemption or waiver granted by our Board of Trustees, securities acquired or
held in violation of the Ownership Limit will be transferred to a trust for the
exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the security
holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate.  A transfer of Shares may be void if it causes
a person to violate the Ownership Limit. 
The Ownership Limit could delay or prevent a change in control and,
therefore, could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a
premium over the then-prevailing market price for their Shares.  To reduce the ability of the Board to use the
Ownership Limit as an anti-takeover device, in 2004 the Company amended the
Ownership Limit to require, rather than permit, the Board to grant a waiver of
the Ownership Limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such
ownership would not jeopardize the Company’s status as a REIT.


Our Preferred Shares May Affect
Changes in Control

Our
Declaration of Trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to issue up to 100
million preferred shares, and to establish the preferences and rights
(including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares) of
any preferred shares issued.  The Board
of Trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms
of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even
if a change in control were in the interest of security holders.

Inapplicability
of Maryland Law Limiting Certain Changes in Control

Certain
provisions of Maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit
“business combinations” (including certain issuances of equity securities) with
any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of
outstanding securities, or with an affiliate who, at any time within the two-year
period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent
or more of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding voting securities (an “Interested
Shareholder”), or with an affiliate of an Interested Shareholder.  These prohibitions last for five years after
the most recent date on which the Interested Shareholder became an Interested
Shareholder.  After the five-year period,
a business combination with an Interested Shareholder must be approved by two
super-majority shareholder votes unless, among other conditions, holders of
common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is
received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the Interested
Shareholder for its common shares.  As
permitted by Maryland law, however, the Board of Trustees of the Company has
opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination
involving Mr. Zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in
concert with them.  Consequently, the
five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply
to a business combination involving us and/or any of them. Such business
combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders.

Our Success as a REIT Is
Dependent on Compliance with Federal Income Tax Requirements

Our
Failure to Qualify as a REIT Would Have Serious Adverse Consequences to Our
Security Holders

We
believe that we have qualified for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes since our taxable year ended December 31, 1992 based, in part,
upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities
or engaged in significant merger transactions. 
We plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT.  Many of these requirements, however, are
highly technical and complex.  We cannot,
therefore, guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a
REIT.  The determination that we are a REIT
requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within
our control.  For example, to qualify as
a REIT, our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate
or passive related sources that are itemized in the REIT tax laws.  We are also required to distribute to
security holders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income excluding capital
gains.  The fact that we hold our assets
through ERP Operating Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries further
complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or
inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status.  Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make
changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings
that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a
REIT.  We do not believe, however, that
any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our REIT status.

If
we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax at
regular corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS granted us relief under certain
statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years
following the year we first failed to qualify. 
If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would have to pay significant income
taxes.  We, therefore, would have less
money available for investments or for distributions to security holders.  This would likely have a significant adverse
affect on the value of our securities. 
In addition, we would no longer be required to make any distributions to
security holders.  Even if we quality as
a REIT, we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal,


state and local taxes on our income and
property.  In addition, our corporate
housing business and condominium conversion business, which are conducted
through taxable REIT subsidiaries, generally will be subject to federal income
tax at regular corporate rates.

We Could
Be Disqualified as a REIT or Have to Pay Taxes if Our Merger Partners Did Not
Qualify as REITs

If
any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a REIT throughout the
duration of their existence, then they might have had undistributed “C
corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us.  If that was the case and we did not
distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the
merger took place, we might not qualify as a REIT.  We believe based, in part, upon opinions of
legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well
as our own investigations, among other things, that each of our prior merger
partners qualified as a REIT and that, in any event, none of them had any
undistributed “C corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger
with us.  If any of our prior merger
partners failed to qualify as a REIT, an additional concern would be that they
would have recognized taxable gain at the time they merged with us.  We would be liable for the tax on such
gain.  In this event, we would have to
pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable
merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years
of the merger. Finally, we could be precluded from electing REIT status for up
to four years after the year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify
for REIT status.

Compliance with REIT
Distribution Requirements May Affect Our Financial Condition

Distribution Requirements May Increase
the Indebtedness of the Company

We
may be required from time to time, under certain circumstances, to accrue as
income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received.  In such event, or upon our repayment of
principal on debt, we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to
enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a REIT.  Accordingly, we could be required to borrow
funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these
distribution requirements.

Federal Income Tax
Considerations

General

The
following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material
to a holder of common shares.  It is not
exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. For example, it does not give a
detailed discussion of any state, local or foreign tax considerations. The
following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant
to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances.  Moreover, it does not address all tax matters
that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under
the tax laws, such as insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial
institutions or broker-dealers, foreign corporations and persons who are not
citizens or residents of the United States.

The
specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact
on the tax considerations associated with the purchase, ownership and
disposition of common shares. Therefore, it is essential that each prospective
shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the
application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder’s personal tax
situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state,
local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

The
information in this section is based on the current Internal Revenue Code,
current, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations, the legislative history
of the Internal Revenue Code, current administrative interpretations and
practices of the Internal Revenue Service, including its practices and policies
as set forth in private letter rulings, which are not binding on the Internal
Revenue Service, and


existing court decisions.  Future legislation, regulations,
administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or
adversely affect existing interpretations of current law.  Any change could apply retroactively.  Thus, it is possible that the Internal
Revenue Service could challenge the statements in this discussion, which do not
bind the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and that a court could agree
with the Internal Revenue Service.

Our Taxation

We
elected REIT status beginning with the year that ended December 31,
1992.  In any year in which we qualify as
a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion
of our REIT taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our
shareholders.  This treatment
substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations,
which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders
who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive.  We elected taxable REIT subsidiary status for
certain of our corporate subsidiaries, primarily those engaged in condominium
conversion and sale activities.  As a
result, we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities performed by
our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

We
will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our REIT
taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders.
In addition, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax if we do not satisfy
specific REIT distribution requirements. 
We could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items
of tax preference.  In addition, any net
income from “prohibited transactions” (i.e., dispositions of property, other
than property held by a taxable REIT subsidiary, held primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of business) will be subject to a 100%
tax.  We could also be subject to a 100%
penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted
by a taxable REIT subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the
Internal Revenue Service.  If we fail to
satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (described
below) but have maintained our qualification as a REIT because we satisfied
certain other requirements, we will still generally be subject to a 100%
penalty tax on the amount by which we fail such gross income test.  If we fail to satisfy any of the REIT asset
tests (described below) by more than a

de minimis

amount, due to reasonable cause, and we nonetheless maintain our REIT
qualification because of specified cure provisions, we will be required to pay
a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate
multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets.  If we fail to satisfy any provision of the
Internal Revenue Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT
(other than a violation of the REIT gross income or asset tests described
below) and the violation is due to reasonable cause, we may retain our REIT
qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such
failure. Moreover, we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on
certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate.

We
believe that we have qualified as a REIT for all of our taxable years beginning
with 1992. We also believe that our current structure and method of operation
is such that we will continue to qualify as a REIT.  However, given the complexity of the REIT
qualification requirements, we cannot provide any assurance that the actual
results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under
the Internal Revenue Code for a particular year.

If
we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and the relief
provisions described herein do not apply, we will be subject to tax on our
taxable income at regular corporate rates. 
We also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax.” As a
result, our failure to qualify as a REIT would significantly reduce the cash we
have available to distribute to our shareholders.  Unless entitled to statutory relief, we would
be disqualified as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during
which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether we would be
entitled to statutory relief.

Our
qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our ability to satisfy various
requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. 
We are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis
through actual annual operating and other results.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that
we will be


able to continue to operate in a manner so as
to remain qualified as a REIT.

Ownership
of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries by Us

.  The Internal Revenue Code
provides that for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, REITs
may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the
securities of “taxable REIT subsidiaries” or “TRSs”, which are corporations
subject to tax as a regular “C” corporation that have elected, jointly with a
REIT, to be a TRS.  Generally, a taxable
REIT subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a REIT and can
perform impermissible tenant services (discussed above), which would otherwise
taint our rental income under the REIT income tests.  However, the REIT will be obligated to pay a
100% penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses
deducted by our TRSs if the economic arrangements between us, our tenants and
the TRS are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated
parties.  A TRS may also receive income
from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100% federal income tax
liability imposed to REITs.  Income from
prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land, the purchase
and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units.

TRSs
pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates.  The amount of taxes paid on impermissible
tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount.  The TRSs will attempt to minimize the amount
of these taxes, but we cannot guarantee whether, or the extent to which,
measures taken to minimize these taxes will be successful.  To the extent that these companies are
required to pay taxes, less cash may be available for distributions to
shareholders.

Share
Ownership Test and Organizational Requirement

.

In order to qualify
as a REIT, our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100
persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months, or during a
proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months.  Also, not more than 50% in value of our
shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying
certain constructive ownership rules, by five or fewer individuals during the
last half of each taxable year.  In
addition, we must meet certain other organizational requirements, including,
but not limited to, that (i) the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced
by transferable shares and (ii) we are managed by one or more
trustees.  We believe that we have
satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that
we will continue to do so in the future. 
In order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50% share
ownership test discussed above, we have placed certain restrictions on the
transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of
share ownership.  However, such
restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements, and thereby
failing to qualify as a REIT.

Gross
Income Tests

.  To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two
gross income tests:

(1)

At least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived
directly or indirectly from rents from real property, investments in real
estate and/or real estate mortgages, dividends paid by another REIT and from
some types of temporary investments.

(2)

At least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived
from any combination of income qualifying under the 75% test and dividends, non-real
estate mortgage interest, some payments under hedging instruments and gain from
the sale or disposition of stock or securities.

To
qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross
income tests, rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons
and not be based on the net income of the resident.  Also, the rent attributable to personal
property must not exceed 15% of the total rent. 
We may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our
rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in
connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible
services”.  If such services are
impermissible, then we may generally provide them only if they are considered
de minimis in amount, or are provided through an independent contractor from
whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements, or through a
taxable REIT subsidiary. We believe that services provided to residents by us
either are usually or customarily rendered in


connection with the rental of real property
and not otherwise considered impermissible, or, if considered impermissible
services, will meet the

de minimis

test
or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable REIT
subsidiary.  However, we cannot provide
any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with these
positions.

If
we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year,
we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for the year if we are entitled to relief
under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  In this case, a penalty tax would still be
applicable as discussed above. 
Generally, it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we
would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event
these relief provisions do not apply, we will not qualify as a REIT.

Asset
Tests

.  In general, at the close of each quarter of
our taxable year, we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our
assets:

(1)

At
least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate
assets (which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment
trusts) and certain cash related items;

(2)

Not
more than 25% of our total assets may be represented by securities other than
those in the 75% asset class;

(3)

Except
for equity investments in other REITs, qualified REIT subsidiaries (i.e.,
corporations owned 100% by a REIT that are not TRSs or REITs), or taxable REIT
subsidiaries: (a) the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may
not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets and (b) we may not own more
than 10% of the value of or the voting securities of any one issuer; and

(4)

Not
more than 20% of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or
more taxable REIT subsidiaries.

The
10% value test described in clause (b) of (3) above does not apply to
certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the Code.  Under the safe harbor, the following are not
considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10% value test: (i) straight
debt securities, (ii) any loan of an individual or an estate, (iii) certain
rental agreements for the use of tangible property, (iv) any obligation to
pay rents from real property, (v) any security issued by a state or any
political subdivision thereof, foreign government or Puerto Rico only if the
determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of
another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity, or (vi) any
security issued by a REIT.  The timing
and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt
may be subject to a contingency provided that (A) such contingency does
not change the effective yield to maturity, not considering a

de minimis

change which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of
1% or 5% of the annual yield to maturity or we own $1,000,000 or less of the
aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer’s debt and not more
than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or (B) the
contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is
effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of
the debt.  If we hold indebtedness from
any issuer, including a REIT, the indebtedness will be subject to, and may
cause a violation of, the asset tests, unless it is a qualifying real estate
asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor.  We currently own equity interests in certain
entities that have elected to be taxed as REITs for federal income tax purposes
and are not publicly traded.  If any such
entity were to fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not meet the 10% voting
stock limitation and the 10% value limitation and we would fail to qualify as a
REIT.  We believe that we and each of the
REITs we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests
for REIT qualification.  However, we
cannot provide any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with
our determinations.

For
taxable years commencing on or after January 1, 2005, if we fail to
satisfy the 5% or 10% asset tests described above after a 30-day cure period
provided in the Internal Revenue Code, we will be deemed to have met such tests
if the value of our non-qualifying assets is

de minimis

(i.e., does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the total value of our assets at the
end of the applicable quarter or $10,000,000) and we


dispose of the non-qualifying assets within
six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy
the asset tests is discovered.  For
violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess
of the

de minimis

exception described above, we
may avoid disqualification as a REIT under any of the asset tests, after the 30-day
cure period, by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within
such six month period, paying a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the
highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the
non-qualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the Internal
Revenue Service.  If we cannot avail
ourselves of these relief provisions, or if we fail to timely cure any
noncompliance with the asset tests, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.

Annual
Distribution Requirements

.  To qualify as a REIT, we are
generally required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to
our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90% of our REIT
taxable income.  These distributions must
be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following
taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior
year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after
the declaration is made.  We intend to
make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution
requirements.  To the extent that we do
not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less
than 100% of our REIT taxable income, as adjusted, we are subject to tax on
these amounts at regular corporate rates.  
We will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of the required
distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained
for which federal income tax was paid, if we fail to distribute during each
calendar year at least the sum of:  (1) 85%
of our REIT ordinary income for the year; (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain
net income for the year; and (3) any undistributed taxable income from
prior taxable years.  A REIT may elect to
retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay
the tax on the gains.  In that case, a
REIT may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of
the undistributed net capital gains in income as long-term capital gains and
receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the REIT.  For purposes of the 4% excise tax described above,
any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed.

Ownership
of Partnership Interests By Us

.  As a result of our ownership
of the Operating Partnership, we will be considered to own and derive our
proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the Operating
Partnership, respectively, for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests,
including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are
partnerships or limited liability companies.

State
and Local Taxes

.  We may be subject to state or local taxation
in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business or
reside.  Our state and local tax
treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed
above.  Consequently, prospective
shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of
state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares.

Taxation of Domestic Shareholders Subject to U.S. Tax

General

.  If
we qualify as a REIT, distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders
with respect to their common shares, other than capital gain distributions and
distributions attributable to taxable REIT subsidiaries, will be treated as
ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and
profits.  These distributions will not be
eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are
corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the
Internal Revenue Code, meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal
rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates
applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy
applicable holding period requirements. 
In determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits, we
will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to
the common shares.  The portion of
ordinary dividends, made after December 31, 2002, which represent ordinary
dividends we receive from a TRS, will be designated as “qualified dividend
income” to REIT shareholders and are eligible for preferential tax rates if
paid to our non-corporate shareholders.


To
the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess
of our earnings and profits, such distributions will be considered a return of
capital.  Such distributions will be
treated as a tax-free distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a
shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated. To
the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic
shareholder’s tax basis; such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale
of shares.  Shareholders may not include
in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or
capital losses.

Dividends
declared by a REIT in October, November, or December are deemed to have
been paid by the REIT and received by its shareholders on December 31 of
that year, so long as the dividends are actually paid during January of
the following year.   However, this
treatment only applies to the extent of the REIT’s earnings and profits
existing on December 31.  To the
extent the shareholder distribution paid in January exceeds available earnings
and profits as of December 31, the excess is treated as a distribution
taxable to shareholders in the year paid. 
As such, for tax reporting purposes, January distributions paid to
our shareholders may be split between two tax years.

Distributions
made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable
to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital
asset held for more than one year.  This
treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not
exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year.  It applies regardless of the period for which
a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares.  Despite this general rule, corporate
shareholders may be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain
dividends as ordinary income.

Generally,
we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a 15%
rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured Section 1250
gain distribution.   A 15% rate gain
distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are
individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 15%.  An unrecaptured Section 1250 gain
distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are
individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25%.

If,
for any taxable year, we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any
portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all
classes of shares of beneficial interest, then the portion of the capital gains
dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the
total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction.  The numerator of the fraction will be the total
dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the
year.  The denominator of the fraction
will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of
shares of beneficial interest.

We
may elect to retain (rather than distribute as is generally required) net
capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain.  If we make this election, shareholders must
include in income, as long-term capital gain, their proportionate share of the
undistributed net capital gain. 
Shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of
the tax paid by us on these gains. 
Accordingly, they will receive a tax credit or refund for the
amount.  Shareholders will increase the
basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital
gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as
having paid.  Our earnings and profits
will be adjusted appropriately.

In
general, a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal
to the difference between:

(a)

the amount of cash and the fair market value
of any property received in the sale or other disposition; and

(b)

the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the
common shares.

The
gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a
capital asset.  Generally, the capital
gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the common shares were
held for more than one year.


In
general, a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that
were held for six months or less, determined after applying certain holding
period rules, will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that the
shareholder received distributions that were treated as long-term capital
gains.  For shareholders who are
individuals, trusts and estates, the long-term capital loss will be apportioned
among the applicable long-term capital gain rates to the extent that
distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated.

Taxation of Domestic Tax-Exempt Shareholders

Most
tax-exempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the
extent of their unrelated business taxable income, which is often referred to
as UBTI.  Unless a tax-exempt shareholder
holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in
an unrelated trade or business, distributions to the shareholder should not
constitute UBTI.  Similarly, if a
tax-exempt shareholder sells common shares, the income from the sale should not
constitute UBTI unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed
property or used the shares in a trade or business.

However,
for tax-exempt shareholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit
associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified group
legal services plans, income from owning or selling common shares will
constitute UBTI unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set
aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its
investment in common shares.  These
shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside
and reserve requirements which are set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.

In
addition, certain pension trusts that own more than 10% of a “pension-held REIT”
must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the REIT as
UBTI.  We have not been and do not expect
to be treated as a pension-held REIT for purposes of this rule.

Taxation of Foreign Shareholders

The
following is a discussion of certain anticipated United States federal income
tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable
to a foreign shareholder.  For purposes
of this discussion, a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than:

(a)

a citizen or resident of the United States;

(b)

a corporation or partnership created or
organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States or of any
state thereof; or

(c)

an estate or trust whose income is includable
in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its
source.

Distributions
by Us

.  Distributions by us to a foreign shareholder
that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of United
States real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends
will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are
made out of our earnings and profits. 
These distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of United
States federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30% rate, or a lower treaty
rate, unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the
conduct by the foreign shareholder of a United States trade or business.  Please note that under certain treaties lower
withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends
from REITs.  Dividends that are
effectively connected with a United States trade or business will be subject to
tax on a net basis at graduated rates, and are generally not subject to
withholding.  Certification and
disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from
withholding under this exemption.  A
foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional
branch profits tax at a 30% rate or a lower treaty rate.


We
expect to withhold United States income tax at the rate of 30% on any
distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless:

(a)

a lower treaty rate applies and any required
form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed
with us; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder files an IRS Form W-8ECI
with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income.

A
distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will
not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution
does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares.  Instead, the distribution will reduce the
adjusted basis of the common shares.  To
the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common
shares, it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s
common shares.  The tax treatment of this
gain is described below.

We
intend to withhold at a rate of 30%, or a lower applicable treaty rate, on the
entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain
distribution.  In such event, a foreign
shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the IRS if it
subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in excess of our
earnings and profits, and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s
United States tax liability with respect to the distribution.

From
and after the taxable year ending December 31, 2005, any capital gain
dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is “regularly traded” on
an established securities market, will be treated as an ordinary dividend
described above, if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5% of such
class of stock at any time during the taxable year.  Foreign shareholders generally will not be
required to report distributions received from us on U.S. federal income tax
returns and all distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, including any capital gain dividends, will be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax (unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax
treaty), as described above.  In
addition, the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions.

Distributions
to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as
capital gain dividends, other than those arising from the disposition of a United
States real property interest, generally will not be subject to United States
federal income taxation unless:

(a)

the investment in the common shares is
effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s United States trade or
business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same
treatment as domestic shareholders, except that a shareholder that is a foreign
corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax, as discussed above;
or

(b)

the foreign shareholder is a nonresident
alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more
during the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the United States, in which
case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the
individual’s capital gains.

Except
as described above, under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act,
which is known as FIRPTA, distributions to a foreign shareholder that are
attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of United States real property
interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the
gain as income effectively connected with a United States trade or business.
This rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital
gain dividend.  Accordingly, foreign
shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates
applicable to U.S. shareholders, subject to a special alternative minimum tax
in the case of nonresident alien individuals. 
In addition, a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the
branch profits tax discussed above.  We


are required to withhold 35% of these
distributions.  The withheld amount can
be credited against the foreign shareholder’s United States federal income tax
liability.

Although
the law is not entirely clear on the matter, it appears that amounts we
designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held
by U.S. shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in
the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends. Under that
approach, foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against the
United States federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax
paid by us on these undistributed capital gains.  In addition, foreign shareholders would be
able to receive from the IRS a refund to the extent their proportionate share
of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual United States federal income
tax liability.

Foreign Shareholders’
Sales of Common Shares

.  Gain recognized by
a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will
not be subject to United States taxation unless the shares constitute a “United
States real property interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA.  The common shares will not constitute a
United States real property interest so long as we are a domestically
controlled REIT.  A domestically
controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing
period less than 50% in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by
foreign shareholders.  We believe that we
are a domestically controlled REIT. 
Therefore, we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject
to taxation under FIRPTA.  However,
because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded, we cannot
guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled REIT.  In any event, gain from the sale or exchange
of common shares not otherwise subject to FIRPTA will be subject to U.S. tax, if
either:

(a)

the investment in the common shares is
effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s United States trade or
business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same
treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain; or

(b)

the foreign shareholder is a nonresident
alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more
during the taxable year and has a tax home in the United States, in which case
the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual’s
capital gains.

Even
if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled REIT, gain
arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares
still would not be subject to United States taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of
a United States real property interest if:

(a)

the class or series of shares being sold is “regularly
traded,” as defined by applicable IRS regulations, on an established securities
market such as the New York Stock Exchange; and

(b)

the selling foreign shareholder owned 5% or
less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold
throughout the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange.

If
gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under
FIRPTA, the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular United States
income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable U.S.
shareholder, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax, a special alternative
minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible
application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations.  The purchaser of the common shares would be
required to withhold and remit to the IRS 10% of the purchase price.

Information Reporting Requirement and Backup Withholding

We
will report to our domestic shareholders and the Internal Revenue Service the
amount of


distributions paid during each calendar year
and the amount of tax withheld, if any. 
Under certain circumstances, domestic shareholders may be subject to
backup withholding.  Backup withholding
will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain
information to us or the Internal Revenue Service.  Backup withholding will not apply with
respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and
tax-exempt organizations.  Domestic
shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification
for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an
exemption.  Backup withholding is not an
additional tax.  Rather, the amount of
any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will
be allowed as a credit against such person’s United States federal income tax
liability and may entitle such person to a refund, provided that the required
information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

Item 1B.   Unresolved Staff
Comments

None.


Item 2.  Properties

As of December 31,
2006, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding
entities, owned all or a portion of 617 properties in 25 states and the
District of Columbia consisting of 165,716 units.  The Company’s properties are more fully
described as follows:

Resident leases are
generally for twelve months in length and typically require security
deposits.  The garden-style properties
are generally defined as properties with two and/or three story buildings while
the mid-rise/high-rise are defined as properties with greater than three story
buildings.  These two property types
typically provide residents with amenities, which may include a clubhouse,
swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television access. Certain of these
properties offer additional amenities such as saunas, whirlpools, spas, sports
courts and exercise rooms or other amenities. 
The military housing properties are defined as those properties located
on military bases.

The
distribution of the properties throughout the United States reflects the
Company’s belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio
from regional and economic influences. 
At the same time, the Company has sought to create clusters of properties
within each of its primary markets in order to achieve economies of scale in
management and operation.  The Company
may nevertheless acquire additional multifamily properties located anywhere in
the continental United States.

The following tables set
forth certain information by type and state relating to the Company’s
properties (occupancy information excludes condominium conversion, development
and unstabilized acquired properties) at December 31, 2006:


GARDEN-STYLE PROPERTIES


MID-RISE/HIGH RISE PROPERTIES

MILITARY
HOUSING PROPERTIES

The properties currently in various stages of
development at December 31, 2006 are included in the following table.


Consolidated Development Projects as of December 31, 2006

(Amounts in thousands except for project and unit amounts)

(1)

Total capital cost
represents estimated development cost for projects under development and all
capitalized costs incurred to date plus any estimates of costs remaining to be
funded for all projects, all in accordance with GAAP.

(2)

Debt is primarily
tax-exempt bonds that are entirely outstanding, with $18.8 million unfunded and
classified as deposits - restricted in the consolidated balance sheets at
12/31/06.

(3)

EQR acquired its
partner’s interest on 4/28/2006 and now wholly-owns the property. Total Book
Value to Date does not include additional purchase consideration of $30.7
million.


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

The
Company is party to a housing discrimination lawsuit brought by a non-profit
civil rights organization in April 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Maryland.  The suit alleges
that the Company designed and built approximately 300 of its properties in
violation of the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act and
Americans With Disabilities Act.  The
suit seeks actual and punitive damages, injunctive relief (including
modification of non-compliant properties), costs and attorneys’ fees.  The Company believes it has a number of
viable defenses, including that a majority of the named properties were
completed before the operative dates of the statutes in question and/or were
not designed or built by the Company. 
Accordingly, the Company is defending the suit vigorously.  Due to the pendency of the Company’s defenses
and the uncertainty of many other critical factual and legal issues, it is not
possible to determine or predict the outcome of the suit and as a result, no
amounts have been accrued at December, 31, 2006.  While no assurances can be given, the Company
does not believe that the suit, if adversely determined, would have a material
adverse effect on the Company.

The
Company does not believe there is any other litigation pending or threatened
against it that, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably may be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to
a Vote of Security Holders

Certain
information related to equity compensation plans is set forth in Item 8, Notes

Item 6.    Selected Financial Data

The following table sets
forth selected financial and operating information on a historical basis for
the Company.  The following information
should be read in conjunction with all of the financial statements and notes
thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  The historical operating and balance sheet
data have been derived from the historical financial statements of the
Company.  All amounts have also been
restated in accordance with the discontinued operations provisions of SFAS No. 144.  Certain capitalized terms as used herein are
defined in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL
INFORMATION

(Financial information in
thousands except for per share and property data)

(1)

The National Association of
Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from operations (“FFO”)
(April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)),
excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus
depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures. 
Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be
calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002
White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO
for previously depreciated operating properties only.  Once the Company commences the conversion of
units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such
property.  See Item 7 for a
reconciliation of net income to FFO.

(2)

The Company believes that
FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating
performance of a real estate company,


because it is a recognized measure of performance by the
real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions
of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary
among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost
accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help compare the operating
performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to
different companies.  FFO in and of
itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating
activities in accordance with GAAP. 
Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to
net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP
or as a measure of liquidity.  The
Company’s calculation of FFO may differ from other real estate companies due
to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital
expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate
companies.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The
following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial
condition of the Company should be read in connection with the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Due to the Company’s ability to control
the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning
interests in the Partially Owned Properties - Unconsolidated and certain other
entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and
each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the Company for
financial reporting purposes. 
Capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as defined elsewhere
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2006.

Forward-looking
statements in this Item 7 as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
These statements are based on current expectations, estimates,
projections and assumptions made by management. 
While the Company’s management believes the assumptions underlying its
forward-looking statements are reasonable, such information is inherently
subject to uncertainties and may involve certain risks, which could cause
actual results, performance, or achievements of the Company to differ
materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Many of these uncertainties and risks are
difficult to predict and beyond management’s control.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees
of future performance, results or events. 
The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement
forward-looking statements because of subsequent events. Factors that might
cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

We intend to actively acquire and develop
multifamily properties for rental operations and/or conversion into
condominiums, as well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual
condominiums.  We may underestimate the
costs necessary to bring an acquired or development property up to standards
established for its intended market position. 
Additionally, we expect that other major real estate investors with
significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment
opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our
development efforts.  This competition
may increase prices for multifamily properties or decrease the price at which
we expect to sell individual properties. 
We may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to
make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms.  We also plan to develop more properties
ourselves in addition to co-investing with our development partners for either
the rental or condominium market, depending on opportunities in each
sub-market.  This may increase the
overall level of risk associated with our developments.  The total number of development units, cost
of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties
arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and
construction materials), competition and local government regulation.

•

Sources of capital to the Company or labor
and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or
development are more expensive than anticipated;

•

Occupancy levels and market rents may be
adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions
including, without limitation, new construction of multifamily housing, slow
employment growth, availability of low interest mortgages for single-family
home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are
beyond the Company’s control;


and

•

Additional factors as discussed in Part I
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly those under “Risk Factors”.

Readers
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date hereof. 
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions
to these forward-looking statements, which may be made to reflect events or
circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events.  Forward-looking
statements and related uncertainties are also included in Notes 5 and 11 to the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Results of Operations

In
conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy, the Company
has continued to invest or recycle its capital investment in apartment properties
located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended December 31,
2006 and December 31, 2005.  In
summary, we:

Year
Ended December 31, 2006:

•

Acquired $1.8 billion of apartment properties
consisting of 35 properties and 8,768 units, and $134.4 million of land
parcels, all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets; and

•

Sold $2.3 billion of apartment properties
consisting of 335 properties and 39,608 units, as well as 1,069 condominium
units for $216.0 million and $1.6 million of land parcels.

Year
Ended December 31, 2005:

•

Acquired $2.5 billion of apartment properties
consisting of 41 properties and 12,059 units, and $138.3 million of land
parcels, all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets; and

•

Sold $1.4 billion of apartment properties
consisting of 50 properties and 12,848 units, as well as 2,241 condominium
units for $593.3 million and five land parcels for $108.3 million.

On
June 28, 2006, the Company announced that it agreed to sell its Lexford
Housing Division for a cash purchase price of $1.086 billion.  The sale closed on October 5, 2006.  The Lexford Housing Division results are
classified as discontinued operations, net of minority interests, in the
consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.  The Company recorded a gain on sale of
approximately $418.7 million on the sale of the Lexford Housing Division in the
fourth quarter of 2006.  In conjunction
with the Lexford disposition, the Company paid off/extinguished $196.3 million
of mortgage notes payable secured by the properties and incurred approximately
$9.2 million in prepayment penalties upon extinguishment.

The Company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its
apartment communities is net operating income (“NOI”).  NOI represents rental income less property
and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense, and property
management expense.  The Company believes
that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating
performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the
actual operating results of the Company’s apartment communities.

Properties
that the Company owned for all of both 2006 and 2005 (the “2006 Same Store
Properties”), which represented 128,133 units, impacted the Company’s results
of operations.  Properties that the
Company owned for all of both 2005 and 2004 (the “2005 Same Store Properties”),
which represented 154,854 units, also impacted the Company’s results of
operations.  Both the 2006 Same Store
Properties and 2005 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following
paragraphs.

The Company’s
acquisition, disposition, completed development and consolidation of previously
unconsolidated property and variable interest entity activities also impacted
overall results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
2005.  The impacts of these activities
are also discussed in greater


detail in the following paragraphs.

Comparison of the year ended December 31,
2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005

For the year ended
December 31, 2006, income from continuing operations, net of minority interests,
decreased by approximately $46.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31,
2005.  The decrease in continuing
operations is discussed below.

Revenues from the 2006 Same Store
Properties increased $88.7 million primarily as a result of higher rental rates
charged to residents.  Expenses from the
2006 Same Store Properties increased $23.9 million primarily due to higher maintenance,
payroll, utility costs and real estate taxes. 
The following tables provide comparative same store results and
statistics for the 2006 Same Store Properties:

(1)

Average rental rate is
defined as total rental revenues divided by the weighted average occupied units
for the period.

The
following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the
consolidated statements of operations to NOI for the 2006 Same Store
Properties.

For
properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2006 and expects
to continue to own through December 31, 2007, the Company anticipates the
following same store results for the full year ending December 31, 2007:


These
2007 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.

Non-same
store operating results increased $151.0 million and consist primarily of
properties acquired in calendar years 2006 and 2005 as well as our corporate
housing business.

See also
Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
discussion regarding the Company’s segment disclosures.

Fee and asset
management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses decreased $1.5
million primarily as a result of lower income earned from managing fewer
properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities.  As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
Company managed 15,020 units and
16,269 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities.

Property
management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses
associated with the self-management of the Company’s properties as well as
management fees paid to any third party management companies.  These expenses increased by approximately $9.3
million or 10.7%.  This increase is
primarily attributable to higher overall payroll costs and higher overall
computer and training costs specific to the Company’s rollout of a new property
management system.

Depreciation
expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real
estate assets, increased $123.1 million primarily as a result of additional
depreciation expense on newly acquired properties and capital expenditures for
all properties owned.

General and
administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased
approximately $21.9 million between the periods under comparison.  This decrease was primarily due to lower
executive compensation expense due to severance costs for several executive
officers incurred during the year ended December 31, 2005 and a $2.8
million reimbursement of legal expenses during the year ended December 31,
2006.  The Company anticipates that
general and administrative expenses will approximate $50.0 million to $52.0
million for the year ending December 31, 2007.  The above assumption is based on current
expectations and is forward-looking.

Impairment from
continuing operations increased $33.4 million between periods under
comparison.  This increase was primarily
due to an impairment charge on goodwill of $30.0 million related to the
corporate housing business and $2.0 million related to the write-off of various
deferred sales costs following the decision to halt the condominium conversion
and sale process at five assets.

Interest
and other income from continuing operations decreased by approximately $37.3

million,
primarily as a result of the $57.1 million in cash received during the year
ended December 31, 2005 for the Company’s ownership interest in Rent.com,
which was acquired by eBay, Inc. 
This was partially offset by the $3.7 million in additional proceeds for
Rent.com, an increase in interest earned on tax deferred 1031 exchange proceeds
from the Lexford disposition and $14.7 million of forfeited deposits for
various terminated transactions received during the year ended December 31,
2006.

Interest expense
from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs,
increased approximately $67.4 million
primarily as a result of higher variable interest rates and overall debt levels
outstanding.  During the year ended December 31,
2006, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $20.7 million as
compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.  This capitalization of interest primarily
relates to consolidated projects under development.  The effective interest cost on all
indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 6.21% as compared to
6.16% for the year ended December 31, 2005.


Loss from
investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $1.1 million
between the periods under comparison. 
This increase is primarily the result of consolidating previously
unconsolidated properties as of January 1, 2006 as the result of EITF
Issue No. 04-5.  See Note 4 in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Net gain on sales
of unconsolidated entities decreased $1.0 million, due to increased unconsolidated
sales during the year ended December 31, 2005.

Net gain on sales
of land parcels decreased $27.5 million, due to a large gain recorded on the
sale of one land parcel during the year ended December 31, 2005.

Discontinued
operations, net of minority interests, increased approximately $257.8 million
between the periods under comparison.  This
increase is primarily the result of lower real estate net book values for
properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the
same period in 2005.  See Note 13 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Comparison of the year ended December 31,
2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004

For the year ended
December 31, 2005, income from continuing operations, net of minority
interests, increased by approximately $58.5 million when compared to the year
ended December 31, 2004.  The
increase in continuing operations is discussed below.

Revenues from the 2005 Same Store
Properties increased $61.9 million primarily as a result of lower concessions
provided residents and a slight increase in average occupancy rates.  Expenses from the 2005 Same Store Properties
increased $36.2 million primarily due to higher payroll, utility costs and real
estate taxes.  The following tables
provide comparative revenue, expense, NOI and weighted average occupancy for
the 2005 Same Store Properties:

(1)  Year 2005
expenses exclude $11.1 million of uninsured property damage caused by Hurricane
Wilma.  Year 2004 expenses exclude $15.2
million of uninsured property damage caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances,
Ivan and Jeanne.

Non-same
store operating results increased $78.6 million and consist primarily of
properties acquired in calendar years 2005 and 2004 as well as our corporate
housing business.

Fee and asset
management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, decreased by $1.5
million primarily as a result of lower income earned from Ft. Lewis and
managing fewer properties for third


parties and unconsolidated entities.  As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
Company managed 16,269 units and
17,988 units, respectively, for third parties and unconsolidated entities.

Property
management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses
associated with the self-management of the Company’s properties as well as
management fees paid to any third party management companies.  These expenses increased by approximately $10.2
million or 13.3%.  This increase is
primarily attributable to higher overall payroll costs including bonuses,
long-term compensation costs and an increase of the Company’s match for
employee 401(k) contributions.

Depreciation
expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real
estate assets, increased $58.9 million primarily as a result of additional
depreciation expense on newly acquired properties and capital expenditures for
all properties involved.

General and
administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased
approximately $23.3 million between the periods under comparison.  This increase was primarily due to higher
executive compensation expense due to severance costs of $9.8 million for
several executive officers, $7.9 million of additional accruals specific to
performance shares for selected executive officers and a $2.5 million profit
sharing accrual paid in the first quarter of 2006.

Interest
and other income from continuing operations increased approximately $59.6

million,
primarily as a result of the $57.1 million in cash received for the Company’s
ownership interest in Rent.com, which was acquired by eBay, Inc.

Interest expense
from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs,
increased approximately $55.3 million
primarily as a result of higher overall debt balances as well as higher
variable interest rates.  During the year
ended December 31, 2005, the Company capitalized interest costs of
approximately $13.7 million as compared to $14.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2004.  This capitalization of interest
primarily relates to consolidated projects under development.  The effective interest cost on all
indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 6.16% as compared to
5.87% for the year ended December 31, 2004.

(Loss) income from
investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $7.8 million
between the periods under comparison. 
This increase is primarily the result of consolidation of properties
that were previously unconsolidated in the first quarter of 2004.

Net gain on sales
of unconsolidated entities decreased $3.3 million, primarily due to a decrease
in the number of unconsolidated entities sold.

Net gain on sales
of land parcels increased $24.8 million, primarily due to an increase in the
number of land parcels sold and large gains recorded on two land parcels
located in Tyson’s Corner, Virginia.

Discontinued
operations, net of minority interests, increased approximately $330.9 million
between the periods under comparison. 
This increase is primarily the result of higher per unit sales prices
and lower real estate net book values for properties sold during the year ended
December 31, 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004 as well as higher
condominium sales.  The Company
recognized $91.6 million and $32.1 million of net incremental gain on sales of
condominium units (net of provision for income taxes) for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

For the Year Ended December 31,

As of January 1,
2006, the Company had approximately $88.8 million of cash and cash equivalents
and $780.8 million available under its line of credit (net of $50.2 million
which was restricted/dedicated to


support letters of credit and not available for
borrowing).  After taking into effect the
various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash
provided by operating activities, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents
balance at December 31, 2006 was approximately $260.3 million and the
amount available on the Company’s revolving credit facilities was $470.7
million (net of $69.3 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters
of credit and not available for borrowing).

During the year
ended December 31, 2006, the Company generated proceeds from various
transactions, which included the following:

•

Disposed of 340
properties, various individual condominium units and two land parcels,
receiving net proceeds of approximately $2.3 billion;

•

Obtained $395.5
million in net proceeds from the issuance of $400.0 million of ten and one-half
year 5.375% fixed rate public notes and terminated six forward starting swaps
designated to hedge the note issuance, receiving net proceeds of $10.7 million;

•

Obtained $637.0
million in net proceeds from the issuance of $650.0 million of twenty year
3.85% exchangeable fixed rate public notes;

•

Obtained $267.0
million in new mortgage financing; and

•

Issued
approximately 2.9 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $77.7
million.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the above proceeds were
primarily utilized to:

•

Invest
$291.3 million primarily in development projects;

•

Acquire
35 properties and nine land parcels, utilizing cash of $1.7 billion;

•

Repurchase
1.9 million Common Shares utilizing cash of $83.2 million;

•

Repay $493.0
million of mortgage loans;

•

Repay
$60.0 million of fixed rate public notes;

•

Redeem
the series G Preference Interests at a liquidation value of $25.5 million; and

•

Redeem
the Series C Preferred Shares at a liquidation value of $115.0 million.

Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic
conditions, and other opportunities for the investment of available capital,
the Company may repurchase its Common Shares pursuant to its existing share
buyback program authorized by the Board of Trustees.  The Company repurchased $83.2 million
(1,897,912 shares at an average price per share of $43.85) of its Common Shares
during the year ended December 31, 2006 to offset the issuance of 1,144,326
OP Units in connection with three property acquisitions and to partially offset
restricted shares granted and ESPP shares purchased during the year ended December 31,
2006.  The Company is authorized to
repurchase approximately $501.8 million of additional Common Shares.

Company calculates the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum
of (i) the total outstanding Common Shares and assumed conversion of all
OP Units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the Company’s
Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) the “Common Share
Equivalent” of all convertible preferred shares and preference interests/units;
and (iii) the liquidation value of all perpetual preferred shares
outstanding.

The Company expects to
meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures
related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured
note and mortgage note repayments, generally through its working capital, net
cash provided by operating activities and borrowings


under its
revolving credit facilities.  The Company
considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet
operating requirements and payments of distributions.  The Company also expects to meet its
long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage
debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and
development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of
unsecured notes and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and
proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties.  In addition, the Company has significant
unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in
the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative
sources of capital is too high.  The fair
value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the
requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under
its unsecured notes and line of credit. 
Of the $17.2 billion in investment in real estate on the Company’s balance
sheet at December 31, 2006, $11.6 billion or 67.0%, was unencumbered.

The Operating Partnership’s
senior debt credit ratings from Standard & Poors (“S&P”), Moody’s
and Fitch are A-, Baal (positive outlook) and A, respectively.  The Company’s preferred equity ratings from
S&P, Moody’s and Fitch are BBB+, Baa2 (positive outlook) and A-,
respectively.

The Operating Partnership
has a long-term revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to
$1.0 billion which matures in May 2008. 
This facility may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property
acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short term
liquidity requirements.  As of February 26,
2007, $740.0

million was outstanding under
this facility.

See
Note 21 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the
events which occurred subsequent to December 31, 2006.

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate

Our

policy with respect to
capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the
value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the
property.  We track improvements to real
estate in two major categories and several subcategories:

•

Replacements

(inside the unit)

.  These include:

•

flooring such as carpets, hardwood,
vinyl, linoleum or tile;

•

appliances;

•

mechanical equipment such
as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc;

•

furniture and fixtures
such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs,
toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc; and

•

blinds/shades.

All replacements are
depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life.  We expense as incurred all make-ready maintenance
and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual units and
the repair of any replacement item noted above.

•

Building improvements (

outside the unit

).  These include:

•

roof replacement and major
repairs;

•

paving or major resurfacing
of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks;

•

amenities and common areas
such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses,
laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices;

•

major building mechanical
equipment systems;

•

interior and exterior
structural repair and exterior painting and siding;

•

major landscaping and
grounds improvement; and

•

vehicles and office and
maintenance equipment.

All building improvements
are depreciated over a five to ten-year estimated useful life.  We capitalize building improvements and
upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $2,500 (selected projects must
exceed


$10,000);
(ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) improves the
value of the asset.

For the year ended December 31,
2006, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $255.2
million.  This includes the following
(amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):

Capitalized Improvements to Real Estate

For the Year Ended December 31, 2006

(1)

Total units exclude 10,846 unconsolidated units and 3,555 military
housing (fee managed) units.

(2)

Wholly Owned Properties acquired prior to January 1, 2004.

(3)

Wholly Owned Properties acquired during 2004, 2005 and 2006.  Per unit amounts are based on a weighted
average of 27,346 units.

(4)

Includes properties either Partially Owned or sold during the period,
commercial space, condominium conversions and $21.4 million included in
building improvements spent on seventeen specific assets related to major
renovations and repositioning of these assets.

For the year ended December 31,
2005, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $232.5
million.  This includes the following
(amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):

Capitalized Improvements to Real Estate

For the Year Ended December 31, 2005

(1)

Total units exclude 15,899 unconsolidated units.

(2)

Wholly Owned Properties acquired prior to January 1, 2003.

(3)

Wholly Owned Properties acquired during 2003, 2004 and 2005.  Per unit amounts are based on a weighted
average of 20,828 units.

(4)

Includes properties either Partially Owned or sold during the period,
commercial space, condominium conversions and $6.8 million included in building
improvements spent on nine specific assets related to major renovations and
repositioning of these assets.

The Company expects to
fund approximately $145.0

million for capital expenditures for
replacements and building improvements for all consolidated properties,
exclusive of condominium conversion properties, in 2007.  This includes an average of approximately
$1,000 per unit for capital improvements for established properties.

During the year ended December 31,
2006, the Company’s total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer
software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold
improvements to the Company’s property management offices and its corporate
offices, were approximately $10.7

million.  The


Company
expects to fund approximately $8.2 million in total additions to non-real
estate property in 2007.

Improvements to real estate and additions to
non-real estate property were funded from net cash provided by operating
activities.

Derivative Instruments

In
the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest
rate changes.  The Company limits these
risks by following established risk management policies and procedures
including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt
instruments.

The
Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial
institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  When viewed in conjunction with the
underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge,
the Company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does
it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial
position in the future from the use of derivatives.

See
Note 11

in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at December 31,
2006.

Other

Minority
Interests as of December 31, 2006 decreased by $10.7 million when compared
to December 31, 2005.  The primary
factors that impacted this account in the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations and balance sheets during the year ended December 31, 2006
were:

•

The redemption or
repurchase of 1.0 million units of Series G, H and I Preference Interests
with a  combined liquidation value of $48.5
million and a premium on redemption of $0.7 million (see Note 3 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion);

•

Distributions declared to
Minority Interests, which amounted to $36.2 million (excluding Junior
Preference Unit and Preference Interest distributions);

•

The allocation of income
from operations to holders of OP Units in the amount of $72.6 million;

•

The issuance of 1,144,326
OP Units for the acquisition of three properties with a valuation of $49.6
million; and

•

The conversion of 1.7
million OP Units into Common Shares valued at $27.9 million.

Total distributions paid
in January 2007 amounted to $152.4 million (excluding distributions on
Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared
during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006.


Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

The Company has co-invested in various properties
that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of
accounting.  Management does not believe
these investments have a materially different impact upon the Company’s
liquidity, capital resources, credit or market risk than its property management
and ownership activities.  During 2000
and 2001, the Company entered into institutional ventures with an unaffiliated
partner.  At the respective closing
dates, the Company sold and/or contributed 45 properties containing 10,846
units to these ventures and retained a 25% ownership interest in the ventures.  The Company’s joint venture partner
contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed-upon equity value of the properties
comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company.  The Company’s strategy with respect to these
ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets.

As of December 31,
2006, the Company has 11 projects totaling 3,448 units in various stages of
development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30, 2009.  The development agreements currently in place
are discussed in detail in Note 18 of the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements.

See also Notes 2 and 6 in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion
regarding the Company’s investments in partially owned entities.

The
following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations for the next
five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2006:

(a)

Amounts include aggregate
principal payments only.  The Company
paid $465,388, $397,886 and $348,574 for interest on debt, inclusive of
derivative instruments, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

(b)

Minimum basic rent due for
various office space the Company leases and fixed base rent due on a ground
lease for one property.

(c)

Estimated payments to the
Company’s Chairman, two former CEO’s and its chief operating officer based on
planned retirement dates.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

The
Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial
statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2006 and are consistent
with the year ended December 31, 2005.

The Company has identified six significant
accounting policies as critical accounting policies.  These critical accounting policies are those
that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those
requiring significant judgments and estimates. 
With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes
that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and
produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations
for all periods presented.  The six
critical accounting policies are:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill

The
Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments
in real estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent impairment.  The judgments regarding the existence of
impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance,
market conditions, expected


holding period of each asset and legal and
environmental concerns.  Future events
could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment
indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.

Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate

The
Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate
over a 30-year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5-year to 10-year
estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and
replacements components over a 5-year estimated useful life, all of which are
judgmental determinations.

Cost Capitalization

See
the

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and
Improvements to Real Estate

section for discussion of the
policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and
maintenance costs.  In addition, the
Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly
responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major
capital and/or renovation projects. 
These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to
depreciable property.

The
Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67,

Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate
Projects

, for all development projects and uses its professional
judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization
or must be expensed as incurred.  The
Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and
associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend
all of their time on development activities, with capitalization ceasing no
later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy.  These costs are reflected on the balance
sheet as construction in progress for each specific property.  The Company expenses as incurred all payroll
costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted
above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance
and on specific major renovation at selected properties when additional
incremental employees are hired.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative
Instruments

The
valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133
and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149) requires the Company to make
estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments.  The Company, where possible, bases the fair
values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on
listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the
Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and
maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.

Revenue Recognition

Rental
income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is
recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a
straight-line basis.  Leases entered into
between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are
generally year-to-year, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or
monthly basis.  Fee and asset management
revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis.

Share-Based Compensation

The
Company accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123
(R),

Share-Based Payment

, effective January 1,
2006, which results in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair
value of the share compensation granted.

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.  This model is only one method


of valuing options
and the Company’s use of this model should not be interpreted as an endorsement
of its accuracy.  Because the Company’s
share options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing models do
not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its
share options and the actual value of 
the options may be significantly different.

Funds From Operations

For the year ended December 31,
2006, Funds From Operations (“FFO”) available to Common Shares and OP Units decreased
$68.5 million, or 8.7%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005.
For the year ended December 31, 2005, FFO available to Common Shares and
OP Units increased $132.9 million, or 20.4%, as compared to the year ended December 31,
2004.

The
following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO available to Common Shares
and OP Units for each of the five years ended December 31, 2006:

Funds From Operations

(Amounts in thousands)

(1)

The
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds
from operations (“FFO”) (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States (GAAP)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property,
plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures. 
Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be
calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.  The April 2002 White Paper states that
gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously
depreciated operating properties only. 
Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it
simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property.

(2)

The
Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of
the operating performance of a real estate company, because it is a recognized
measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or
losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real
estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar
condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO
can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between
periods or as compared to different companies. 
FFO in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows
from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.  Therefore, FFO should not be exclusively
considered as an


alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating
activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity.  The Company’s calculation of FFO may differ
from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost
capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be
comparable to such other real estate companies.

(3)

Gain on
sales of discontinued operations, net of minority interests, has been reduced
by approximately $4.5 million in one-time accrued retention benefits for the
year ended December 31, 2006, related to the previously announced October 5,
2006 closing of the Lexford Housing Division disposition.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risks relating to the Company’s financial
instruments result primarily from changes in short-term LIBOR interest
rates.  The Company does not have any
direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk.

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving credit facilities.  The Company typically incurs fixed rate debt
obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures, while it
typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital
needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long-term fixed rate
financing.  The Company continuously
evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other
factors, including its assessment of the current and future economic
environment.

The
Company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market
risk.  Interest rate protection
agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice
versa.  Derivatives are used for hedging
purposes rather than speculation.  The
Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes.   See also Note 11 to the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative
instruments.

The
fair values of the Company’s financial instruments (including such items in the
financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents, other assets, lines
of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses, rents received in advance and
other liabilities) approximate their carrying or contract values based on their
nature, terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates.  The fair value of the Company’s mortgage
notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately $3.2 billion and $4.5
billion, respectively, at December 31, 2006.

The
Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $1.5 billion,
or 18.4% of total debt at December 31, 2006, net of the effects of any
derivative instruments.  If market rates
of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 49 basis
points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest
rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would
decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7.3

million.  If market
rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 49
basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average
interest rates), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt
would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7.3

million.

At
December 31, 2006, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of
approximately $6.6 billion, net of the effects of any derivative
instruments.  If market rates of interest
permanently increased by 60 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s
existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the
Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $6.0 billion.  If market rates of interest permanently
decreased by 60 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing
weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s
fixed rate debt would be approximately $7.3 billion.

At
December 31, 2006, the Company’s derivative instruments had a net
liability fair value of approximately $16.2 million.  If market rates of interest permanently
increased by 54 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing
weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Company’s
derivative instruments would be approximately $16.4 million.  If market rates of interest


permanently decreased by 54 basis points (a
10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the
net liability fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments would be
approximately $16.2 million.

The
Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $1.9 billion,
or 24.9% of total debt at December 31, 2005, net of the effects of any
derivative instruments.  If market rates
of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 37 basis
points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest
rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would
decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7.1 million.  If market rates of interest on all of the
floating rate debt permanently decreased by 37 basis points (a 10% decrease
from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in
interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and
cash flows by approximately $7.1 million.

At
December 31, 2005, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of
approximately $5.7 billion, net of the effects of any derivative
instruments.  If market rates of interest
permanently increased by 63 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s
existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the
Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $5.2 billion.  If market rates of interest permanently
decreased by 63 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing
weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s
fixed rate debt would be approximately $6.3 billion.

At
December 31, 2005, the Company’s derivative instruments had a net
liability fair value of approximately $6.0 million.  If market rates of interest permanently
increased by 49 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing
weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Company’s
derivative instruments would be approximately $0.1 million.  If market rates of interest permanently
decreased by 49 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing
weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Company’s
derivative instruments would be approximately $11.5 million.

These
amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest
rates on the Company’s financial instruments.  The foregoing assumptions apply to the entire
amount of the Company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not
differentiate among maturities.  These
analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic
activity that could exist in such an environment.  Further, in the event of changes of such
magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its
exposure to the changes.  However, due to
the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible
effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Company’s financial structure
or results.

The
Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its
debt and derivative instruments and, therefore, its exposure to market risk,
nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at
advantageous pricing.  Consequently,
future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes
discussed above.

Item 9.  Changes in and
Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.   Controls and
Procedures

(a)         Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures:

Effective as of December 31,
2006, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures


pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15.  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in its Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

(b)         Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting:

Equity Residential’s
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Exchange Act.  Under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Based on the Company’s
evaluation under the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework,
management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2006. 
Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report which is included herein at Item 8, page F-3.

(c)         Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting:

There
were no changes to the internal control over financial reporting of the Company
identified in connection with the Company’s evaluation referred to above that
occurred during the fourth quarter of 2006 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Equity Residential (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and
2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2006.  Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying
index to the financial statements and schedule. 
These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
the Company’s management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Equity Residential at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Equity Residential’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders

Equity Residential

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting at Item 9A, that Equity Residential (the “Company”) maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the “COSO Criteria”).   The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States).  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Equity
Residential maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the COSO Criteria.  Also, in our opinion,
Equity Residential maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the
COSO Criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Equity Residential as of December 31, 2006
and 2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2006 and our report dated February 21, 2007,
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1.

Business

Equity Residential (“EQR”),
a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993, is an S&P
500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high
quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. EQR has
elected to be taxed as a REIT.

EQR is the general
partner of, and as of December 31, 2006 owned an approximate 93.6% ownership
interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership
(the “Operating Partnership”). The Company is structured as an umbrella
partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), under which all property ownership and business
operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.
References to the “Company” include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those
entities owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.

As of December 31, 2006,
the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities,
owned all or a portion of 617

properties in 25
states and the District of Columbia consisting of 165,716 units. The ownership
breakdown includes (table does not include various uncompleted development
properties):

The “Wholly Owned
Properties” are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting. The
Company beneficially owns 100% fee simple title to 545 of the 546 Wholly Owned
Properties. The Company owns the building and improvements and leases the land
underlying the improvements under a long-term ground lease that expires in 2026
for one property. This one property is consolidated and reflected as a real
estate asset while the ground lease is accounted for as an operating lease in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

.

The “Partially Owned
Properties - Consolidated” are controlled by the Company but have partners with
minority interests and are accounted for under the consolidation method of
accounting. The “Partially Owned Properties - Unconsolidated” are partially
owned but not controlled by the Company and consist of investments in
partnership interests and/or subordinated mortgages that are accounted for
under the equity method of accounting. The “Military Housing (Fee Managed)”
property consists of an investment in a limited liability company that, as a
result of the terms of the operating agreement, is accounted for as a
management contract right with all fees recognized as fee and asset management
revenue.

2.             Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of
Presentation

Due to the Company’s
ability as general partner to control either through ownership or by contract
the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, other than entities that own
controlling interests in the

F-12

Partially Owned Properties - Unconsolidated and
certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating
Partnership and each such subsidiary has been consolidated with the Company for
financial reporting purposes. Effective March 31, 2004, the consolidated
financial statements also include all variable interest entities for which the
Company is the primary beneficiary.

The Company’s mergers and
acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in accordance with either
Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 16,

Business Combinations

, or SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

. SFAS No. 141
requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting. The fair value of the
consideration given by the Company in the mergers were used as the valuation
basis for each of the combinations. The accompanying consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows include the results of the properties purchased through
the mergers and through acquisitions from their respective closing dates.

Real
Estate Assets and Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate

The Company allocates the
purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets
acquired based on their fair values in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 141. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase
price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent
appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing
of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing
comparable properties in our portfolio, and other market data. The Company also
considers information obtained about each property as a result of its
pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating
the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company
allocates the purchase price of acquired real estate to various components as
follows:

•

Land
– Based on actual purchase price if acquired separately or market
research/comparables if acquired with an operating property.

•

Furniture,
Fixtures and Equipment – Ranges between $8,000 and $13,000 per apartment unit
acquired as an estimate of the fair value of the appliances & fixtures
inside a unit. The per-unit amount applied depends on the type of apartment
building acquired. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over
an estimated useful life of five years.

•

In-Place
Leases – The Company considers the value of acquired in-place leases that meet
the definition outlined in SFAS No. 141, paragraph 37. The amortization period
is the average remaining term of each respective in-place acquired lease.

•

Other
Intangible Assets – The Company considers whether it has acquired other
intangible assets that meet the definition outlined in SFAS No. 141, paragraph
39, including any customer relationship intangibles. The amortization period is
the estimated useful life of the acquired intangible asset.

•

Building
– Based on the fair value determined on an “as-if vacant” basis. Depreciation
is calculated on the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of
thirty years.

Replacements inside a unit such as appliances and carpeting are
depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life. Expenditures for ordinary
maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant
renovations and improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the
asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally five to ten
years. Initial direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense
approximates the deferral and amortization of initial direct leasing costs over
the lease terms. Property sales or dispositions are recorded when title
transfers to unrelated third parties, contingencies have been removed and
sufficient cash consideration has been received by the Company. Upon
disposition, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
respective accounts. Any gain or loss on sale is recognized in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

The Company classifies
real estate assets as real estate held for disposition when it is certain a
property will be disposed of in accordance with SFAS No. 144 (see further
discussion below).

F-13

The Company classifies
properties under development and/or expansion and properties in the lease up
phase (including land) as construction in progress until construction has been
completed and all certificates of occupancy permits have been obtained.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill

In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. SFAS No. 142 prohibits
the amortization of goodwill and requires that goodwill be reviewed for
impairment at least annually. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

SFAS
Nos. 142 and 144 were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. The Company adopted these standards effective January 1, 2002. See Notes
13 and 19 for further discussion.

The
Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments
in real estate and goodwill, for indicators of permanent impairment. The
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors
such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of
each asset and legal and environmental concerns. Future events could occur
which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and
an impairment loss is warranted.

For long-lived assets to
be held and used, the Company compares the expected future undiscounted cash
flows for the long-lived asset against the carrying amount of that asset. If
the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying
amount of the asset, the Company further analyzes each individual asset for
other temporary or permanent indicators of impairment. An impairment loss would
be recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the
carrying amount of the asset if the Company deems this difference to be
permanent.

For long-lived assets to
be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value
of the asset, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount
of the asset measured at the time that the Company has determined it will sell
the asset. Long-lived assets held for disposition and the related liabilities
are separately reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their
estimated fair values, less their costs to sell, and are not depreciated after
reclassification to real estate held for disposition.

Cost Capitalization

See
the

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation of
Investment in Real Estate

section for discussion of the policy with
respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance
costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of
employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the
supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects. These costs are
reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.

The
Company follows the guidance in SFAS No. 67,

Accounting
for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects

, for
all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining
whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as
incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and
payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and
who spend all of their time on development activities, with capitalization
ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of
occupancy. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in
progress for each specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all
payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except
as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy
issuance and on specific major renovation at selected properties when additional
incremental employees are hired.

F-14

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all
demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of
deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or
less, at the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains
its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions. The combined account
balances at one or more institutions typically exceed the Federal Depository
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a
concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC
insurance coverage. The Company believes that the risk is not significant, as
the Company does not anticipate the financial institutions’ non-performance.

Deferred
Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs
include fees and costs incurred to obtain the Company’s lines of credit and
long-term financings. These costs are amortized over the terms of the related
debt. Unamortized financing costs are written-off when debt is retired before
the maturity date. The accumulated amortization of such deferred financing
costs was $24.5 million and $18.3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative
Instruments

The
valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107,

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

,
and SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos. 137/138/149),

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

, requires the Company to make estimates and judgments
that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible,
bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative
instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are
not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with
similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial
instruments.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest
rate changes. The Company limits these risks by following established risk
management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge
interest rate risk on debt instruments.

The
Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial
institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in
conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are
designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from those
instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net
income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

On
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 and its amendments (SFAS Nos.
137/138/149), which requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either
assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure
those instruments at fair value. Additionally, the fair value adjustments will
affect either shareholders’ equity or net income depending on whether the
derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so,
the nature of the hedging activity. When the terms of an underlying transaction
are modified, or when the underlying transaction is terminated or completed,
all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked-to-market with
changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument
matures. Any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet
the hedging criteria of SFAS No. 133 is marked-to-market each period. The
Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The
fair value of the Company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were
approximately $3.2 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2006.

The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments, other than mortgage
notes payable, unsecured notes and derivative instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, lines of credit and other financial instruments, approximate their
carrying or contract values. See Note 11 for further discussion of derivative
instruments.

F-15

Revenue
Recognition

Rental income
attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized
monthly as it is earned, which is not materially different than on a
straight-line basis. Leases entered into between a resident and a property, for
the rental of an apartment unit, are generally year-to-year, renewable upon
consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. Fee and asset management
revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis.

Share-Based Compensation

The
Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment,

as
required effective January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all companies to
expense share-based compensation (such as share options), as well as making
other revisions to SFAS No. 123. As the Company began expensing all share-based
compensation effective January 1, 2003, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not
have a material effect on its consolidated statements of operations or
financial position.

The
cost related to share-based employee compensation included in the determination
of net income for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 is equal to that
which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been
applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS No. 123. The
cost related to share-based employee compensation included in the determination
of net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 is less than that which
would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to
all awards since the original effective date of SFAS No. 123. The following
table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair
value based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards for
the year ended December 31, 2004 (amounts in thousands except per share
amounts):

The fair value of the option
grants as computed under SFAS No. 123 would be recognized over the vesting
period of the options. The fair value for the Company’s share options was
estimated at the time the share options were granted using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

F-16

The valuation method and
assumptions are the same as those the Company used in accounting for option
expense in its consolidated financial statements. The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. This
model is only one method of valuing options and the Company’s use of this model
should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy. Because the
Company’s share options have characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the
existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the
fair value of its share options and the actual value of the options may be
significantly different.

Income
Taxes

Due to the structure of
the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations of its operating
properties, no provision for federal income taxes has been made at the EQR
level. Historically, the Company has generally only incurred certain state and
local income, excise and franchise taxes. The Company has elected Taxable REIT
Subsidiary (“TRS”) status for certain of its corporate subsidiaries, primarily
those entities engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities and as a
result, these entities incurred federal and state income taxes.

The Company provided for current
income, franchise and excise taxes allocated as follows in the consolidated
statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
(amounts in thousands):

(1)

Primarily includes state and local income,
excise and franchise taxes. In 2006, also includes $2.9 million of federal
income taxes related to a forfeited deposit on a terminated sale transaction and
included in income from continuing operations. In 2005, also includes $2.0
million of federal income taxes related to the sale of land parcels owned by a
TRS and included in income from continuing operations.

(2)

Primarily represents federal income taxes
incurred on the gains on sales of condominium units owned by a TRS and included
in discontinued operations. Also represents state and local income, excise and
franchise taxes on operating properties sold and included in discontinued
operations.

The Company utilized
approximately $43.9 million of net operating losses (“NOL”) during the year
ended December 31, 2005 and had no NOL carryforwards available as of January 1,
2007 or 2006.

During the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company’s tax treatment of dividends and
distributions were as follows:

F-17

The aggregate cost of
land and depreciable property for federal income tax purposes as of December
31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $10.2 billion and $9.4 billion,
respectively.

Minority
Interests

Operating
Partnership:  Net income is allocated to
minority interests based on their respective ownership percentage of the
Operating Partnership. The ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the
number of units of limited partnership interest (“OP Units”) held by the
minority interests by the total OP Units held by the minority interests and EQR.
Issuance of additional common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value
per share (the “Common Shares”), and OP Units changes the ownership interests
of both the minority interests and EQR. Such transactions and the related proceeds
are treated as capital transactions.

Partially Owned
Properties:  The Company reflects
minority interests in partially owned properties on the balance sheet for the
portion of properties consolidated by the Company that are not wholly owned by
the Company. The earnings or losses from those properties attributable to the
minority interests are reflected as minority interests in partially owned
properties in the consolidated statements of operations.

U

se of Estimates

In preparation of the
Company’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as
well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been made to the prior period
financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation. These
reclassifications have not changed the results of operations or shareholders’
equity.

Other

The
Company adopted FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46,

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities,

as required, effective March 31, 2004.
The adoption required the consolidation of all previously unconsolidated
development projects. FIN No. 46 requires the Company to consolidate the
assets, liabilities and results of operations of the activities of a variable
interest entity, which for the Company includes only its development
partnerships, if the Company is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s
residual returns and/or is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from such
entity’s activities. Due to the March 31, 2004 effective date, the Company has
only consolidated the results of operations beginning April 1, 2004. The
adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have any effect on net income as the aggregate
results of operations of these development properties were previously included
in (loss) income from

F-18

investments in unconsolidated entities.

The Company adopted the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 150 and FSP No. FAS 150-3,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of
both Liabilities and Equity,

effective December 31, 2003. SFAS No.
150 and FSP No. FAS 150-3 require the Company to make certain disclosures
regarding noncontrolling interests that are classified as equity in the
financial statements of a subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in
the parent’s financial statements under SFAS No. 150 (e.g., minority interests
in consolidated limited-life subsidiaries). The Company is presently the
controlling partner in various consolidated partnerships consisting of 25
properties and 4,873 units and various uncompleted development properties
having a minority interest book value of $26.8 million at December 31, 2006. Some
of these partnerships contain provisions that require the partnerships to be
liquidated through the sale of its assets upon reaching a date specified in
each respective partnership agreement. The Company, as controlling partner, has
an obligation to cause the property owning partnerships to distribute proceeds
of liquidation to the Minority Interests in these Partially Owned Properties
only to the extent that the net proceeds received by the partnerships from the
sale of its assets warrant a distribution based on the partnership agreements. As
of December 31, 2006, the Company estimates the value of Minority Interest
distributions would have been approximately $106.7 million (“Settlement Value”)
had the partnerships been liquidated. This Settlement Value is based on
estimated third party consideration realized by the partnerships upon
disposition of the Partially Owned Properties and is net of all other assets
and liabilities, including yield maintenance on the mortgages encumbering the
properties, that would have been due on December 31, 2006 had those mortgages
been prepaid. Due to, among other things, the inherent uncertainty in the sale
of real estate assets, the amount of any potential distribution to the Minority
Interests in the Company’s Partially Owned Properties is subject to change. To
the extent that the partnerships’ underlying assets are worth less than the
underlying liabilities, the Company has no obligation to remit any consideration
to the Minority Interests in Partially Owned Properties.

The Company adopted EITF
Issue No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or
the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

(Issue “04-5”),
effective January 1, 2006. Issue 04-5 provides guidance in determining whether
a general partner controls a limited partnership. The Company consolidated its
Lexford syndicated portfolio consisting of 20 separate partnerships (10
properties) containing 1,272 units, all of which were sold October 5, 2006. The
adoption did not have a material effect on the results of operations or
financial position. See Note 4 for further discussion of the adoption of EITF
Issue No. 04-5.

In March 2005, the FASB
issued FIN No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations,

an interpretation of SFAS No. 143,

Asset Retirement Obligations

. A conditional asset retirement
obligation refers to a legal obligation to retire assets where the timing
and/or method of settlement are conditioned on future events. FIN No. 47
requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional
asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability’s fair value can be
reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN No. 47 for the
year ended December 31, 2005. The adoption did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2006, the FASB
ratified the consensus in FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes

. FIN No. 48 creates a single model to address
uncertainty in income tax positions and prescribes a minimum recognition
threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the
financial statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure and transition and, clearly scopes income taxes out of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

. The Company will adopt FIN No.
48 as required effective January 1, 2007. While still under review, based on
analyses completed and knowledge of the Company’s tax positions to date, adoption
of FIN No. 48 is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated
results of operations or financial position.

Shareholders’ Equity and Minority Interests

The following tables present the changes in the Company’s
issued and outstanding Common Shares and OP Units for the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004:

In February 1998, the
Company filed and the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 Registration Statement
to register $1.0 billion of equity securities. In addition, the Company carried
over $272.4 million related to a prior registration statement. As of February 7,
2007, $956.5 million in equity securities remained available for issuance under
this registration statement.

During the
year ended December 31, 2006, the Company repurchased 1,897,912 of its Common
Shares on the open market at an average price of $43.85 per share. The Company
paid approximately $83.2 million for these shares, which were retired
subsequent to the repurchase.

The equity positions of various
individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating
Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the “Minority
Interests – Operating Partnership”. Subject to certain restrictions, the
Minority Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR
Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

Net proceeds from the Company’s Common
Share and Preferred Share (see definition below) offerings are contributed by
the Company to the Operating Partnership. In return for those contributions,

F-20

EQR receives a
number of OP Units in the Operating Partnership equal to the number of Common
Shares it has issued in the equity offering (or in the case of a preferred
equity offering, a number of preference units in the Operating Partnership
equal in number and having the same terms as the Preferred Shares issued in the
equity offering). As a result, the net offering proceeds from Common Shares and
Preferred Shares are allocated between shareholders’ equity and Minority
Interests – Operating Partnership to account for the change in their respective
percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

The Company’s declaration of trust
authorizes the Company to issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares of
beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share (the “Preferred Shares”), with
specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board of Trustees may
determine, which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to
the rights of holders of the Company’s Common Shares.

The following table
presents the Company’s issued and outstanding Preferred Shares as of December
31, 2006 and 2005:

(1)

On or after the redemption date, redeemable
preferred shares (Series D, K and N) may be redeemed for cash at the option of
the Company, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the
liquidation price per share, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any.

(2)

On or after the redemption date, convertible
preferred shares (Series E & H) may be redeemed under certain circumstances
at the option of the Company for cash (in the case of Series E) or Common

Preferred Shares. In addition, on or after the Conversion Date, the convertible
Preference Interests may be converted under certain circumstances at the option
of the holder (in whole but not in part) to Common Shares based upon the
contractual conversion rate, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any. Prior
to the Conversion Date, the convertible Preference Interests may be converted under
certain circumstances at the option of the holder (in whole but not in part) to
Common Shares based upon the contractual conversion rate, plus accrued and

15, 2026. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.85%. The notes are
exchangeable into EQR Common Shares, at the option of the holders, under
specific circumstances or on or after August 15, 2025, at an initial exchange
rate of 16.3934 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an
initial exchange price of $61.00 per share). The initial exchange rate is
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including upon an increase in
the Company’s dividend rate. Upon an exchange of the notes, the Operating
Partnership will settle any amounts up
to the principal amount of the notes in cash and the remaining exchange value,
if any, will be settled, at the Operating Partnership’s option, in cash, EQR Common Shares or a
combination of both.

On
or after August 18, 2011, the

Operating Partnership may redeem the notes at a redemption price
equal to the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon. Upon notice of redemption by the Operating Partnership, the holders may elect to exercise their
exchange rights In addition, on August 18, 2011,

F-28

August 15, 2016 and August 15, 2021 or
following the occurrence of certain change in control transactions prior to
August 18, 2011, note holders may require the

Operating Partnership to repurchase the notes for an amount equal
to the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon.

Note
holders may also require an exchange of the notes should the closing sale price
of Common Shares exceed 130% of the exchange price for a certain period of time
or should the trading price on the notes be less than 98% of the product of the
closing sales price of Common Shares multiplied by the applicable exchange rate
for a certain period of time.

During
the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company:

•

Issued
$500.0 million of ten and one-half year 5.125% fixed-rate public notes,
receiving net proceeds of $496.2 million;

•

Had
$300.0 million in fixed rate public notes remarketed as originally contemplated
in a remarketing agreement entered into in connection with the original
issuance of the notes, with the interest rate changing from 6.63% to 6.584%
effective April 14, 2005 (notes still mature on April 13, 2015);

•

Repaid
$190.0 million of fixed rate public notes at maturity; and

•

Repaid
$4.3 million of other unsecured notes.

Aggregate payments of
principal on unsecured notes payable for each of the next five years and
thereafter are as follows (amounts in thousands):

(1)

Principal payments on unsecured
notes includes amortization of any discounts or premiums related to the notes. Premiums
and discounts are amortized over the life of the unsecured notes.

(2)

Includes the $650.0 million of
3.85% convertible unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2026.

10.

Lines
of Credit

The Operating Partnership
has an unsecured revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to
$1.0 billion maturing on May 29, 2008, with the ability to increase available
borrowings by an additional $500.0 million under certain circumstances. Advances
under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at
various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s
credit rating or based on bids received from the lending group. EQR has
guaranteed the Operating Partnership’s credit facility up to the maximum amount
and for its full term.

On August 30, 2005, the
Operating Partnership entered into a one-year $600.0 million revolving credit
facility maturing on August 29, 2006. This credit facility was repaid in full
and terminated on January 20, 2006.

On July 6, 2006, the
Operating Partnership entered into a one-year $500.0 million revolving credit
facility maturing on July 6, 2007. This facility was repaid in full and
terminated on October 13, 2006. Advances under this facility bore interest at
variable rates based on LIBOR at various interest periods plus a spread
dependent upon the Operating Partnership’s credit rating. EQR guaranteed this
credit facility up to the maximum amount and for its full term.

F-29

As of December 31, 2006
and 2005, $460.0 million and $769.0 million, respectively, was outstanding and $69.3
million and $50.2 million, respectively, was restricted (dedicated to support
letters of credit and not available for borrowing) on the credit facilities. During
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the weighted average interest rates
were 5.40% and 3.80%, respectively.

11.

Derivative Instruments

The following table
summarizes the consolidated derivative instruments at December 31, 2006 (dollar
amounts are in thousands):

(1)
Fair Value Hedges – Converts outstanding fixed rate debt to a floating interest
rate.

(2)
Forward Starting Swaps – Designed to partially fix the interest rate in advance
of a planned future debt issuance.

(3)
Development Cash Flow Hedges – Converts outstanding floating rate debt to a
fixed interest rate.

On December 31, 2006, the
net derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as other assets of
approximately $0.1 million and as other liabilities of approximately $16.3 million.
As of December 31, 2006, there were approximately $14.6 million in deferred
losses, net, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Based on the
estimated fair values of the net derivative instruments at December 31, 2006,
the Company may recognize an estimated $2.4 million of accumulated other
comprehensive loss as additional interest expense during the year ending
December 31, 2007.

In January 2006, the
Company received approximately $10.7 million to terminate six forward starting
swaps in conjunction with the issuance of $400.0 million of ten and one-half
year unsecured notes. The $10.7 million has been deferred as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be recognized as a reduction of
interest expense over the life of the unsecured notes.

12.          Earnings
Per Share

The following tables set
forth the computation of net income per share – basic and net income per share
– diluted (amounts in thousands except per share amounts):

F-30

Convertible preferred shares/units
that could be converted into 1,163,908, 1,772,048 and 3,215,472 weighted
average Common Shares for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive. In
addition, the effect of the Common Shares that could ultimately be issued upon
the conversion/exchange of the

Operating Partnership’s $650.0
million exchangeable senior notes were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive.

For additional disclosures regarding
the employee share options and restricted shares, see Notes 2 and 14.

13.

Discontinued Operations

The Company has presented
separately as discontinued operations in all periods the results of operations
for all consolidated assets disposed of on or after January 1, 2002 (the date
of adoption of SFAS No. 144), all operations related to condominium conversion
properties effective upon their respective transfer into a TRS and all
properties held for sale.

The
components of discontinued operations are outlined below and include the
results of operations for the respective periods that the Company owned such
assets during each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004
(amounts in thousands).

F-31

Note:  Discontinued operations includes the Lexford
Housing Division.

(1)

Includes
expenses paid in the current period for properties sold or held for sale in
prior periods related to the Company’s period of ownership.

(2)

Includes
only interest expense specific to secured mortgage notes payable for properties
sold and/or held for sale.

For the properties sold
during 2006 (excluding condominium conversion properties), the investment in
real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, and the mortgage notes payable
balances at December 31, 2005 were $1.3 billion and $348.4 million,
respectively.

The net real estate basis
of the Company’s condominium conversion properties owned by the TRS and
included in discontinued operations (excludes the Company’s five halted
conversions as they are now held for use), which were included in investment in
real estate, net in the consolidated balance sheets, was $95.4 million and $121.3
million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

14.

Share
Incentive Plans

On
May 15, 2002, the shareholders of EQR approved the Company’s 2002 Share
Incentive Plan. The maximum aggregate number of awards that may be granted
under this plan may not exceed 7.5% of the Company’s outstanding Common Shares
calculated on a “fully diluted” basis and determined annually on

F-32

the first day of each calendar year. As of
January 1, 2007, this amount equaled 23,574,211, of which 13,521,150 is
available for future issuance. No awards may be granted under the 2002 Share
Incentive Plan after February 20, 2012.

Pursuant to the 2002
Share Incentive Plan and the Fifth Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and
Share Award Plan (collectively the “Share Incentive Plans”), officers, trustees
and key employees of the Company may be granted share options to acquire Common
Shares (“Options”) including non-qualified share options (“NQSOs”), incentive
share options (“ISOs”) and share appreciation rights (“SARs”), or may be
granted restricted or non-restricted shares, subject to conditions and
restrictions as described in the Share Incentive Plans. Finally, certain
executive officers of the Company participate in the Company’s performance
based restricted share plan. Options, SARs, restricted shares and performance
shares are sometimes collectively referred to herein as “Awards”.

The Options are generally
granted at the fair market value of the Company’s Common Shares at the date of
grant, vest in three equal installments over a three year period, are
exercisable upon vesting and expire ten years from the date of grant. The
exercise price for all Options under the Share Incentive Plans is equal to the
fair market value of the underlying Common Shares at the time the Option is
granted. The Fifth Amended and Restated 1993 Share Option and Share Award Plan
will terminate at such time as all outstanding Awards have expired or have been
exercised/vested. The Board of Trustees may at any time amend or terminate the
Share Incentive Plans, but termination will not affect Awards previously
granted. Any Options which had vested prior to such a termination would remain
exercisable by the holder.

As to the restricted shares that
have been awarded through December 31, 2006, these shares generally vest three
years from the award date. During the three-year period of restriction, the
Company’s unvested restricted shareholders receive quarterly dividend payments on
their shares at the same rate and on the same date as any other Common Share
holder. In addition, the Company’s unvested restricted shareholders have the
same voting rights as any other Common Share holder. As a result, dividends
paid on unvested restricted shares are included as a component of retained
earnings (deficit) and have not been considered in reducing net income
available to Common Shares in a manner similar to the Company’s preferred share
dividends for the earnings per share calculation. If employment is terminated
prior to the lapsing of the restriction, the shares are generally canceled.

In addition, each year prior to
2007, selected executive officers of the Company received performance-based
awards. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company has elected to discontinue the
award of new performance-based award grants. The executive officers have the
opportunity to earn in Common Shares an amount as little as 0% to as much as
225% of the target number of performance-based awards. The owners of
performance-based awards have no right to vote, receive dividends or transfer
the awards until Common Shares are issued in exchange for the awards. The
number of Common Shares the executive officer actually receives on the third
anniversary of the grant date will depend on the excess, if any, by which the
Company’s Average Annual Return (i.e., the average of the Common Share
dividends declared during each year as a percentage of the Common Share price
as of the first business day of the first performance year and the average
percentage increase in funds from operations (“FFO”) for each calendar year on
a per share basis over the prior year) for the three performance years exceeds
the average of the 10-year Treasury Note interest rate as of the first business
day in January of each performance year (the “T-Note Rate”).

F-33

If the Company’s Average

Annual Return
  exceeds the T-Note Rate by:

Less

than

0.99%

1-1.99%

2%

3%

4%

5%

6%

Greater

than

7%

Then
  the executive officer will receive Common Shares equal to the target number
  of awards times the

following %:

0%

50%

100%

115%

135%

165%

190%

225%

If the Company’s Average Annual
Return exceeds the T-Note Rate by an amount which falls between any of the
percentages in excess of the 2% threshold, the performance-based award will be
determined by extrapolation between the two percentages. Fifty percent of the
Common Shares to which an executive officer may be entitled under the
performance share grants will vest, subject to the executive’s continued
employment with the Company, on the third anniversary of the award (which will
be the date the Common Shares are issued); twenty-five percent will vest on the
fourth anniversary and the remaining twenty-five percent will vest on the fifth
anniversary. The Common Shares will also fully vest upon the executive’s death,
retirement at or after age 62, disability or upon a change in control of the
Company.

The following tables summarize compensation
information regarding the performance shares, restricted shares, share options
and ESPP for the three years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (amounts in
thousands):

Compensation expense is recognized for all Awards over
the vesting period. The total compensation expense related to Awards not yet
vested at December 31, 2006 is $23.7 million, which is expected to be
recognized over a weighted average term of 1.6 years.

See Note 2 for additional information regarding the
Company’s share-based compensation.

intrinsic value and weighted average remaining contractual life in years of options
exercisable as of December 31, 2006 is $156.8 million and 5.1 years,
respectively.

As of December 31, 2005
and 2004, 6,864,922 Options (with a weighted average exercise price of $25.60)
and 6,851,442 Options (with a weighted average exercise price of $24.47) were
exercisable, respectively.

Employee
Plans

The Company established
an Employee Share Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) to provide employees and trustees
the ability to annually acquire up to $100,000 of Common Shares of the Company.
In 2003, the Company’s shareholders approved an increase in the aggregate
number of Common Shares available under the ESPP to 7,000,000 (from 2,000,000).
The Company has 4,270,759 Common Shares available for purchase under the ESPP
at December 31, 2006. The Common Shares may be purchased quarterly at a price
equal to 85% of the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a share on the last
day of such quarter; and (b) the greater of: (i) the closing price for a share
on the first day of such quarter, and (ii) the average closing price for a
share for all the business days in the quarter. The following table summarizes
information regarding the Common Shares issued under the ESPP:

The Company established a
defined contribution plan (the “401(k) Plan”) to provide retirement benefits
for employees that meet minimum employment criteria. The Company matches dollar
for dollar up to the first 3% of eligible compensation that a participant
contributes to the 401(k) Plan (2% for 2004). Participants are vested in the
Company’s contributions over five years. The Company made contributions in the
amount of $3.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively, and expects to make contributions in the amount of
approximately $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

The
Company may also elect to make an annual discretionary profit-sharing
contribution as a percentage of each individual employee’s eligible
compensation under the 401(k) Plan. The Company expects to make contributions
in the amount of approximately $3.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2006. The Company made contributions of approximately $2.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2005 and did not make a contribution for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

The
Company established a supplemental executive retirement plan (the “SERP”) to
provide certain officers and trustees an opportunity to defer a portion of their
eligible compensation in order to save for retirement. The SERP is restricted
to investments in Company Common Shares, certain marketable securities that
have been specifically approved, and cash equivalents. The deferred
compensation liability represented in the SERP and the securities issued to
fund such deferred compensation liability are consolidated by the Company and
carried on the Company’s balance sheet, and the Company’s Common Shares held in
the SERP are accounted for as a reduction to paid in capital.

16.

Distribution
Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan

On November 3, 1997, the
Company filed with the SEC a Form S-3 Registration Statement to register
14,000,000 Common Shares pursuant to a Distribution Reinvestment and Share
Purchase Plan (the “DRIP Plan”). The registration statement was declared
effective on November 25, 1997. The Company has 11,571,277 Common Shares
available for issuance under the DRIP Plan at December 31, 2006.

The DRIP Plan provides
holders of record and beneficial owners of Common Shares and Preferred Shares
with a simple and convenient method of investing cash distributions in
additional Common Shares (which is referred to herein as the “Dividend
Reinvestment – DRIP Plan”). Common Shares may also be purchased on a monthly
basis with optional cash payments made by participants in the DRIP Plan and
interested new investors, not currently shareholders of the Company, at the
market price of the Common

F-36

Shares less a discount ranging between 0% and 5%, as determined in
accordance with the DRIP Plan (which is referred to herein as the “Share
Purchase – DRIP Plan”). Common Shares purchased under the DRIP Plan may, at the
option of the Company, be directly issued by the Company or purchased by the
Company’s transfer agent in the open market using participants’ funds.

17.

Transactions
with Related Parties

The Company provided
asset and property management services to certain related entities for
properties not owned by the Company. Fees received for providing such services
were approximately $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million for the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company leases its
corporate headquarters from an entity controlled by EQR’s Chairman of the Board
of Trustees. The lease terminates on July 31, 2011. Amounts incurred for such
office space for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, were approximately $2.8 million, $2.1 million and $1.9 million. The
Company believes these amounts equal market rates for such space.

The Company had the
following additional non-continuing related party transactions:

•

The Company reimbursed its Chief
Operating Officer for the actual operating costs (excluding acquisition costs)
of operating his personal aircraft for himself and other employees on Company
business in 2005 and 2004. Amounts incurred were approximately $0.4 million and
$0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

•

The
Company leased space in an office building in Augusta, Georgia indirectly owned
by one of EQR’s former trustees since May 2003 and directly owned by an entity
affiliated with the same EQR trustee from 1998 to 2003 (individual was a
trustee through May 2004). Approximately $0.2 million was incurred for such
office space for the year ended December 31, 2004.

18.

Commitments
and Contingencies

The Company, as an owner
of real estate, is subject to various Federal, state and local environmental
laws. Compliance by the Company with existing laws has not had a material
adverse effect on the Company. However, the Company cannot predict the impact
of new or changed laws or regulations on its current properties or on
properties that it may acquire in the future.

The Company is party to a
housing discrimination lawsuit brought by a non-profit civil rights
organization in April 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Maryland. The suit alleges that the Company designed and built approximately
300 of its properties in violation of the accessibility requirements of the
Fair Housing Act and Americans With Disabilities Act. The suit seeks actual and
punitive damages, injunctive relief (including modification of non-compliant
properties), costs and attorneys’ fees. The Company believes it has a number of
viable defenses, including that a majority of the named properties were
completed before the operative dates of the statutes in question and/or were
not designed or built by the Company. Accordingly, the Company is defending the
suit vigorously. Due to the pendency of the Company’s defenses and the
uncertainty of many other critical factual and legal issues, it is not possible
to determine or predict the outcome of the suit and as a result, no amounts
have been accrued at December 31, 2006. While no assurances can be given, the
Company does not believe that the suit, if adversely determined, would have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

The
Company does not believe there is any other litigation pending or threatened
against it that, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably may be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

During the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company established a reserve and recorded a
corresponding expense, net of insurance receivables, for estimated uninsured
property damage at

F-37

certain of its properties caused by various hurricanes in each
respective year. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company received $12.1
million in insurance proceeds and recorded an additional $6.2 million of
receivables in anticipation of proceeds expected. As of December 31, 2006, a
receivable of $5.1 million and a liability of $3.2 million are included in
other assets and rents received in advance and other liabilities, respectively,
on the consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31,
2006, the Company has eleven projects

totaling 3,448 units

in various
stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30,
2009. The primary development agreements currently in place have the following
key terms:

•

The first development partner has
the right, at any time following completion of a project, to stipulate a value
for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the Company
based on such value. If the Company chooses not to purchase the interest, the
Company must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such
value. The Company’s partner must exercise this right as to all projects
subject to the agreement within five years after the receipt of the final
certificate of occupancy on the last developed property.

•

The second
development partner has the right, at any time following completion of a
project, to require the Company to purchase the partner’s interest in that
project at a mutually agreeable price. If the Company and the partner are
unable to agree on a price, both parties will obtain appraisals. If the
appraised values vary by more than 10%, both the Company and its partner will
agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to
its determination of value. The Company may elect at that time not to purchase
the property and instead, authorize its partner to sell the project at or above
the agreed-upon value to an unrelated third party.

Five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on
the last developed property, the Company must purchase, at the agreed-upon
price, any projects remaining unsold.

•

The
third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following
stabilization, as defined, to market a subject project for sale. Thereafter,
either the Company or its development partner may market a subject project for
sale. If the Company’s development partner proposes the sale, the Company may
elect to purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the
sale until two independent appraisers appraise the project. If the two
appraised values vary by more than 5%, a third appraiser will be chosen to
determine the fair market value of the property. Once a value has been
determined, the Company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its
development partner to sell the project at the agreed-upon value.

In addition, the
Company has various deal-specific development agreements with partners, the
overall terms of which are similar in nature to those described above.

The Company’s guaranty of a
credit enhancement agreement with respect to certain tax-exempt bonds issued to
finance certain public improvements at a multifamily development project was
terminated effective May 2, 2005 as the tax-exempt bonds were redeemed in full
and the associated letter of credit was cancelled.

During the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, total operating lease payments incurred for office
space, including a portion of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and
utilities, aggregated $6.7 million, $6.1 million and $5.8 million,
respectively.

The Company has entered
into a retirement benefits agreement with its Chairman of the Board of Trustees
and deferred compensation agreements with its chief operating officer and two
former chief executive officers. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004, the Company recognized compensation expense of $1.1 million, $2.2
million and $39,000, respectively, related to these agreements.

The following table
summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations for minimum rent payments

F-38

under operating leases and deferred compensation for the next five
years and thereafter as of December 31, 2006:

(a)

Minimum basic rent due for various
office space the Company leases and fixed base rent due on a ground lease for
one property.

(b)

Estimated payments to the Company’s
Chairman, two former CEO’s and its chief operating officer based on planned
retirement dates.

19.

Impairment

The Company recorded
approximately $30.0 million of asset impairment charges related to its write-down
of the entire carrying value of the goodwill on its corporate housing business
during the year ended December 31, 2006. Following the guidance in SFAS No.
142, this charge was the result of the continued poor operating performance of
the corporate housing business and management’s expectations for future
performance. This charge is reflected on the consolidated statements of
operations as impairment.

The Company also took an
impairment charge of $2.0 million related to the write-off of various deferred
sales costs following the decision to halt the condominium conversion and sale
process at five assets. The remaining $2.0 million of impairment losses in 2006
along with the $0.6 million and $1.5 million of losses in 2005 and 2004,
respectively, represent the write-off of various pursuit and out-of-pocket
costs for terminated acquisition, disposition and development transactions.

20.

Reportable
Segments

Operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is
evaluated regularly by senior management. Senior management decides how
resources are allocated and assesses performance on a monthly basis.

The Company’s primary business is owning, managing,
and operating multifamily residential properties, which includes the generation
of rental and other related income through the leasing of apartment units to
residents. Senior management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment
communities individually and geographically, and both on a same store and
non-same store basis; however, each of our apartment communities generally has
similar economic characteristics, residents, products and services. The
Company’s operating segments have been aggregated by geography in a manner
identical to that which is provided to its chief operating decision maker.

The Company’s fee and asset management, development
(including FIN No. 46 partially owned properties), condominium conversion and
corporate housing (Equity Corporate Housing or “ECH”) activities are immaterial
and do not individually meet the threshold requirements of a reportable segment
as provided for in SFAS No. 131 and as such, have been aggregated in the tables
presented below.

All revenues are from external customers and there is
no customer who contributed 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues during
the three years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, or 2004.

The primary financial measure for the Company’s rental
real estate properties is net operating income (“NOI”), which represents rental
income less:  1) property and maintenance
expense; 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense; and 3) property management
expense (all as reflected in the accompanying statements of operations). The
Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of
the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct
measure of the actual operating results of the Company’s apartment communities.
Current year NOI is compared to prior year NOI and current year budgeted NOI as
a measure of financial performance. The following table presents NOI for each
segment from our rental real estate specific to continuing operations as well as
total assets for the years ended December 31, 2006, and 2005, respectively
(amounts in thousands):

F-39

following:

•

$3.7
