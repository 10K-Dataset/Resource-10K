                   PART I


ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF TEXTRON*

           Textron is a multi-industry company with operations  in
two  business sectors - Manufacturing and Financial Services.  The
Manufacturing  sector  consists  of  four  business   segments   -
Aircraft, Automotive, Industrial, and Systems and Components.  The
business segments of the Financial Services sector are Finance and
Paul Revere.

     Financial information by business segment and geographic area
is  incorporated herein by reference to pages 28,  53  and  54  of
Textron's 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders.

Manufacturing
    Information regarding the segments of the Manufacturing sector
is  contained  on  pages 29 through 31, 41 and 61  through  63  of
Textron's  1994  Annual Report to Shareholders,  which  pages  are
incorporated herein by reference.

     The  Aircraft segment consists of Bell Helicopter and Cessna.
Bell  Helicopter  is a leading manufacturer of  light  and  medium
helicopters  for  civil and military uses.  Bell  is  teamed  with
Boeing   Helicopters  in the development of the  V-22  tilt  rotor
aircraft  for  the U.S. Department of Defense.  In the  light  and
medium  helicopter  market, Bell Helicopter  has  two  major  U.S.
competitors  and  one major European competitor.  Certain  of  its
competitors are substantially larger and more diversified aircraft
manufacturers.   Bell  Helicopter markets its  products  worldwide
through  its  own  sales  force  as well  as  through  independent
representatives.   Price, financing terms,  aircraft  performance,
reliability  and product support are significant  factors  in  the
sale  of  helicopters.  Revenues of Bell Helicopter accounted  for
approximately  14%,  13% and 11% of Textron's  total  revenues  in
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
____________________

*  Reference  herein  to  "Textron"  includes  Textron  Inc.,  its
divisions and subsidiaries.   A Textron "Division" is an operating
unit  which  may  be  comprised of an unincorporated  division  of
Textron, a subsidiary of Textron, or an unincorporated division of
a subsidiary.



     Cessna  is  the world's largest designer and manufacturer  of
light  and  mid-sized  business  jets  and  single-engine  utility
turboprop aircraft.  Cessna is also developing the Citation  X,  a
larger  business  jet  with first deliveries scheduled  for  1996.
Cessna  recently announced its intention to re-commence production
of  the  Cessna  172, 182 and 206 piston-engine  general  aviation
aircraft upon completion of new manufacturing facilities.   Cessna
markets  its  products worldwide primarily through its  own  sales
force as well as through independent representatives.  Cessna  has
five  major competitors, two of which are located in the U.S.  and
three  overseas.   Cessna's fanjets and  turboprops  compete  with
other   aircraft  that  are  comparable  in  size,  speed,  range,
capacity,  handling  characteristics and price.   Reliability  and
product support are also significant factors in the sale of  these
aircraft.

     The  Divisions  of  the  Automotive segment  supply  products
primarily  to  automotive  original equipment  manufacturers.   In
April  1994, Textron established Textron Automotive Company as  an
umbrella organization for the Divisions of the Automotive segment.
In  July 1994, the Davidson Exterior Trim Division was merged with
Textron  Acustar Plastics to become Textron Automotive  Exteriors,
and the Davidson Interiors Division was renamed Textron Automotive
Interiors.   The headquarters of these Divisions and  the  Randall
and  McCord  Winn  Divisions  have been  relocated,  with  Textron
Automotive  Company, to the Detroit, Michigan area.   Products  of
the  Automotive  segment are marketed through the sales  force  of
each  Division.   In general, these Divisions operate  in  markets
that  are  very  competitive.  These Divisions  compete  in  their
markets on the basis of price, product quality and delivery.

     The Divisions of the Industrial segment sell products to  the
industrial  and  consumer markets.  Products are marketed  through
the   sales   force  of  each  Division,  and,  where  applicable,
independent distributors, sales representatives and retailers.  In
general,  these  Divisions  operate  in  markets  that  are   very
competitive.  In varying degrees, these Divisions compete in their
markets  on  the basis of price, product quality and  performance,
brand  image,  service  and delivery.  In August  1994,  Textron's
Homelite Division was sold to Deere & Company.

      The   Divisions  of  the  Systems  and  Components   segment
manufacture  products primarily for the commercial  aerospace  and
defense  industries.  All Divisions of the Systems and  Components
segment  are  subject to keen competition.  Each Division  markets
its  products  through its own sales force and, where  applicable,
independent  representatives.  The principal  competitive  factors
are price, reliability, product performance and, where applicable,
product  support.   In October 1994, the Textron Lycoming  Turbine
Engine  Division was sold to AlliedSignal Inc.  Effective  January
11,  1995,  the  Aircraft Engine Components Textron  Division  was
merged into the Airfoil Textron Division; the name of the combined
division has been changed to Turbine Engine Components Textron.




Financial Services

     Information regarding the segments of the Financial  Services
sector is contained on pages 26, 27, 31, 32, 41, 57, 58 and 63  of
Textron's  1994  Annual Report to Shareholders,  which  pages  are
incorporated herein by reference.

    Products of the Financial Services sector are marketed through
company-owned  sales  offices and, where  applicable,  independent
brokers.   The  insurance  and  consumer  and  commercial  finance
businesses  are  highly competitive and subject to  regulation  by
various government authorities.

     The  Finance segment consists of Avco Financial Services  and
Textron  Financial Corporation.  Avco Financial Services  competes
with  other consumer finance companies as well as companies  which
finance  the  sale of their own merchandise or the merchandise  of
others,  industrial  banks, and the personal loan  departments  of
commercial  banks and credit unions.  Revenues of  Avco  Financial
Services accounted for approximately 14%, 15% and 16% of Textron's
total  revenues  in  1994, 1993 and 1992,  respectively.   Textron
Financial  Corporation  competes  with  other  commercial  finance
companies  as  well  as  institutional lenders,  primarily  banks.
Price  and  service are the principal competitive factors  in  the
Finance segment.

      Paul   Revere   is  the  leading  provider   of   individual
non-cancellable  disability  insurance  in  North  America.   Paul
Revere  competes  with  many  other insurance  companies  offering
similar  products.  Insurance companies compete on  the  basis  of
many factors including financial strength, pricing and other terms
and   conditions  of  products,  commission  structure,  perceived
stability  of  the insurer, claims paying ratings,  service,  name
recognition and reputation.

Backlog
     Information  regarding Textron's backlog  of  government  and
commercial orders by business segment at the end of the  past  two
fiscal  years  is  contained on page 28 of Textron's  1994  Annual
Report  to  Shareholders,  which page is  incorporated  herein  by
reference.

     Approximately 49% of Textron's total backlog at December  31,
1994  represents orders which are not expected to be filled within
the  1995 fiscal year.  Approximately 64% of the total backlog  is
funded.



Government Contracts
     In  1994,  37%  and 53% of the revenues of the  Aircraft  and
Systems and Components segments, respectively, constituting 17% of
Textron's  consolidated revenues, were generated  by  or  resulted
from contracts with the United States Government.  U.S. Government
business   is  subject  to  competition,  changes  in  procurement
policies   and   regulations,  the  continuing   availability   of
Congressional  appropriations, world  events,  and  the  size  and
timing of programs in which Textron may participate.
     A  substantial portion of Textron's government contracts  are
fixed-price  or fixed-price incentive contracts.  Contracts  which
contain  incentive  pricing terms provide for upward  or  downward
adjustments  in the prices paid by the U.S. Government  thereunder
upon  completion  of the contract or any agreed  portion  thereof,
based  on  cost  or  other performance factors.   U.S.  Government
contracts generally may be terminated in whole or in part  at  the
convenience  of  the U.S. Government or if the  contractor  is  in
default.   Upon  termination of a contract for the convenience  of
the  U.S.  Government,  the contractor  is  normally  entitled  to
reimbursement for allowable costs incurred  (up to a maximum equal
to  the  contract price) and an allowance for profit or adjustment
for  loss  if  the contractor would have incurred a loss  had  the
entire contract been completed.  If, however, a contract is  termi
nated for default:  (i) the contractor is paid such amount as  may
be agreed upon for manufacturing materials and partially completed
products accepted by the U.S. Government; (ii) the U.S. Government
is   not  liable  for  the  contractor's  costs  with  respect  to
unaccepted items and is entitled to repayment of advance  payments
and  progress payments, if any, related to the terminated portions
of the contract; and (iii) the contractor may be liable for excess
costs  incurred  by  the U.S. Government in procuring  undelivered
items  from  another  source.   Additional  information  regarding
defense  expenditures  is contained on  pages  29  through  31  of
Textron's  1994  Annual Report to Shareholders,  which  pages  are
incorporated herein by reference.

Research and Development
     Information  regarding  Textron's  research  and  development
expenditures  is  contained on pages 40 and 48 of  Textron's  1994
Annual Report to Shareholders, which pages are incorporated herein
by reference.

Patents and Trademarks
     Textron  owns, or is licensed under, a number of patents  and
trademarks   throughout   the  world  relating   to   methods   of
manufacturing and products.  Patents and trademarks have  been  of
value  in the past and are expected to be of value in the  future;
however,  the loss of any single patent or group of patents  would
not,  in the opinion of Textron, materially affect the conduct  of
its business.



Environmental Considerations
    Textron's operations, like those of other companies engaged in
similar  businesses, are subject to numerous laws and  regulations
designed  to protect the environment.   Compliance with such  laws
has  not  had, and is not expected to have, a material  effect  on
capital  expenditures,  earnings or the  competitive  position  of
Textron.   Expenditures for environmental control facilities  have
not  had,  and  are  not expected to have, a  material  effect  on
capital  expenditures,  earnings or the  competitive  position  of
Textron.   Additional information regarding environmental  matters
is  contained  on  pages  25, 40 and 53 of Textron's  1994  Annual
Report  to  Shareholders, which pages are incorporated  herein  by
reference.

Employees
     At  December  31,  1994,  Textron  had  approximately  53,000
employees.

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES
     At  December 31, 1994, Textron operated a total of 138 plants
located  throughout  the United States and 9  plants  outside  the
United States.  Of the total of 147 plants, Textron owned 102  and
the balance was leased.  In the aggregate, the total manufacturing
space was approximately 25 million square feet.
      In  addition, Textron owns or leases offices, warehouse  and
other space at various locations throughout the United States  and
outside  the  United  States.  Textron also owns  or  leases  such
machinery  and equipment as is necessary in the operation  of  its
Divisions.   Textron  considers the  productive  capacity  of  the
plants  operated by each of its business segments to be  adequate.
In  general,  the plants and machinery are in good condition,  are
considered  to  be adequate for the uses to which they  are  being
put, and are substantially in regular use.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
     On  January  19,  1995,  Textron and the  Ohio  Environmental
Protection  Agency  ("Ohio EPA") entered  into  a   consent  order
concerning  previously reported compliance issues related  to  air
emissions  from  Textron's Randall Division plant  in  Wilmington,
Ohio, which included payment of a civil penalty of $267,500.
     In  addition, there are pending or threatened against Textron
and its subsidiaries lawsuits and other proceedings, some of which
allege  violations of federal government procurement  regulations,
involve  environmental  matters, or are or  purport  to  be  class
actions.   Among these suits and proceedings are some  which  seek
compensatory,  treble or punitive damages in substantial  amounts;
fines,   penalties  or  restitution;  the  cleanup  of   allegedly
hazardous   wastes;  or,  under  federal  government   procurement
regulations, could result in suspension or debarment of Textron or
its subsidiaries from U.S. Government contracting for a period  of
time.  These suits and proceedings are being defended or contested
on behalf of Textron and its subsidiaries.



     On  the  basis  of  information presently available,  Textron
believes   that  any  liability  for  the  suits  and  proceedings
mentioned  above,  or  the impact of the application  of  relevant
government  regulations,  would not  have  a  material  effect  on
Textron's net income or financial condition.

ITEM 4.     SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
     No  matters  were  submitted to a vote of Textron's  security
holders  during  the last quarter of the period  covered  by  this
Report.

           SCHEDULE I - CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT
                                        
        For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994
                                        
                                        
      Financial  information  of  the Registrant is  omitted  because  condensed
financial  information  of  the Textron Parent Company  Borrowing  Group,  which
includes  the Registrant and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries  other  than
its  finance  and insurance subsidiaries, is shown on pages 55-56  of  Textron's
1994 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Management believes that the disclosure  of
financial information on the basis of the Textron Parent Company Borrowing Group
results  in  a  more meaningful presentation, since this group  constitutes  the
Registrant's basic borrowing entity and the only restrictions on net  assets  of
Textron's  subsidiaries relate to its finance and insurance  subsidiaries.   The
Registrant's  investment in its finance and insurance subsidiaries is  reflected
on  page  55  of Textron's 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders under the  caption
"Investments in finance and insurance subsidiaries."

      The  Textron  Parent Company Borrowing Group received  dividends  of  $115
million, $94 million and $78 million from its finance and insurance subsidiaries
in  1994,  1993  and  1992, respectively.  The portion  of  the  net  assets  of
Textron's  finance and insurance subsidiaries available for cash  dividends  and
other  payments to the Textron Parent Company Borrowing Group is  restricted  by
the  terms  of lending agreements and insurance statutory requirements.   As  of
December  31,  1994,  approximately $245 million of their  net  assets  of  $2.2
billion  was available to be transferred to the Textron Parent Company Borrowing
Group pursuant to these restrictions.

      For  information  concerning the Textron Parent Company Borrowing  Group's
long-term debt and restrictions contained in its debt agreements, see Note 8  to
