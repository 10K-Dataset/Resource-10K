Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




















Obligations
  and Funded Status

The following summarizes
  the changes in the benefit obligation and in the fair value of plan assets
  and provides a reconciliation of the funded status to the amounts recognized
  in the balance sheet for the pension and postretirement benefit plans, along
  with the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations:






To improve returns at core
  businesses and to complete the integration of certain acquisitions, Textron
  approved and committed to a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of
  2000 based upon targeted cost reductions. This program was expanded in 2001,
  and in October 2002 Textron announced a further expansion of the program as
  part of its strategic effort to improve operating efficiencies, primarily in
  its industrial businesses. Textron’s restructuring program includes corporate
  and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions, consolidation of
  facilities primarily in the United States and Europe, rationalization of
  certain product lines, outsourcing of non-core production activity, the
  divestiture of non-core businesses, and streamlining of sales and
  administrative overhead. Under this restructuring program, Textron has
  reduced its workforce by approximately 11,000 employees from continuing
  operations, representing approximately 19% of its global workforce since the
  restructuring was first announced. A total of 107 facilities have been closed
  under this program, including 45 manufacturing plants, primarily in the
  Industrial and Fastening Systems segments.

In total, Textron estimates
  that the entire program for continuing operations will be approximately $540
  million (including $11 million related to the divested Automotive Trim
  business (“Trim”)). As of January 1, 2005, $519 million of cost has been
  incurred relating to continuing operations (including $11 million related to
  Trim), with $213 million in the Industrial segment, $219 million in the
  Fastening Systems segment, $38 million in the Cessna segment, $29 million in
  the Bell segment, $9 million in the Finance segment and $11 million at
  Corporate. Costs incurred through January 1, 2005 include $268 million in
  severance costs, $98 million in asset impairment charges (net of gains on the
  sale of fixed assets), $54 million in contract termination costs and $99
  million in other associated costs.
