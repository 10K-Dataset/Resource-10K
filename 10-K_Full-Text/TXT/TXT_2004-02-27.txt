PART I

Item
1.

Business of
Textron

Business Segments

We are a global multi-industry company with
operations in five business segments — Bell, Cessna,
Fastening Systems, Industrial and Finance. Our business segments
include operations that are unincorporated divisions of Textron
Inc. or its subsidiaries and others that are separately
incorporated subsidiaries.

Bell Segment

The Bell segment is comprised of Bell Helicopter
and Textron Systems.

Bell Helicopter

Bell Helicopter is one of the largest suppliers
of helicopters, tiltrotors, and helicopter-related spare parts
and services in the world. Bell Helicopter manufactures for both
military and commercial applications. A commercial tiltrotor
model is also in development. Bell Helicopter’s revenues
accounted for approximately 18%, 16% and 14% of our total
revenues in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

Bell Helicopter supplies advanced military
helicopters and support (including spare parts, support
equipment, technical data, trainers, pilot and maintenance
training, component repairs, aircraft modifications, contractor
maintenance and field and product support engineering services)
to the U.S. Government and to military customers outside
the U.S. Bell Helicopter is one of the leading suppliers of
helicopters to the U.S. Government and, in association with
The Boeing Company, the only supplier of military tiltrotors.
Bell Helicopter makes sales to non-U.S. military customers only
with the concurrence of the U.S. State Department.

Bell Helicopter is teamed with The Boeing Company
to develop, produce and provide life cycle support for the
V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft for the U.S. Department
of Defense. Tiltrotor aircraft are designed to provide the
benefits of both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. The
Department of Defense continues to support the V-22 program via
Acquisition Decision Memorandums that recorded the results of
Defense Acquisition Board meetings in May and July 2003. Through
Production Lot 8, the U.S. Government has procured
seventy-six V-22 aircraft. An expanded V-22 flight test program
is currently under way.

Bell Helicopter is engaged in the engineering and
manufacturing development stage of the H-1 upgrade program for
the U.S. Marine Corps. This program will produce an
advanced attack and a utility model helicopter, the AH-1Z and
UH-1Y, which are uniquely designed to have 84% parts
commonality, which meets the U.S. Government intent to
reduce operational life cycle costs. In December 2003, Bell
Helicopter received a contract from the U.S. Government to
furnish six UH-1Y aircraft and three AH-1Z aircraft for Low Rate
Initial Production (LRIP) Lot 1.

Bell Helicopter is also a leading supplier of
commercially certified helicopters to corporate, offshore
petroleum exploration and development, utility, charter, police,
fire, rescue and emergency medical helicopter operators.

Bell Helicopter is a member of Bell/ Agusta
Aerospace Company, L.L.C., a joint venture with Agusta, a
leading helicopter manufacturer based in Italy, for the design,
manufacture, sale and customer support of a commercial
tiltrotor, the BA609, and a new medium twin-engine helicopter,
the AB139. BA609 development is progressing. Ground run testing
of the BA609 commenced in December 2002 and the aircraft
achieved its maiden flight on March 7, 2003, in helicopter
mode. The aircraft is now undergoing manufacturing modification
to add equipment and upgraded software for additional flight
testing to be conducted beginning in the third quarter of 2004.
The AB139 received IFR certification from the Italian



airworthiness authorities in June 2003, and
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration certification is
planned for June 2004.

Bell Helicopter supports helicopter operators by
providing off-the-shelf spare parts from strategically located
distribution centers throughout the world and real time
technical services through an extensive network of technical
personnel. Bell Helicopter also engineers, manufactures and
distributes spare parts for helicopters made by other original
equipment manufacturers.

In the light and medium helicopter market
segments, Bell Helicopter has two major U.S. competitors and one
major European competitor. Bell Helicopter markets its products
around the world through its own sales force and through
independent representatives. Price, financing terms, aircraft
performance, reliability and product support are significant
factors in the sale of helicopters. Bell Helicopter has
developed the world’s largest distribution system to sell
and support helicopters, serving customers in over 100 countries.

Textron Systems

Textron Systems is a primary supplier to the
defense and aerospace markets. Textron Systems manufactures
“smart” weapons, airborne and ground-based
surveillance systems, aircraft landing systems, hovercraft,
search and rescue vessels, armored vehicles and turrets,
reciprocating piston aircraft engines, and aircraft and missile
control actuators, valves and related components. Textron
Systems is involved in supplying the U.S. Air Force with
some of its premier smart weapons as prime contractor for the
Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) and is a subcontractor to The
Boeing Company for tail actuation systems on the Joint Direct
Attack Munition (JDAM). Textron Systems also holds a primary
systems integrator role on the U.S. Army’s Future
Combat System for unattended ground systems and sensors. While
Textron Systems sells most of its products directly to U.S.
customers, it also sells an increasing number of products in
over 35 other countries through a growing, global network of
sales representatives and distributors.

Actuation products for the aerospace, defense and
industrial markets are sold under trade names of HR Textron and
APCO. Specialty marine, land vehicle, and turret products are
sold under the trade names of Textron Marine & Land Systems
and Cadillac Gage. Weapons, surveillance, and landing systems
are sold under the Textron Systems name. Reciprocating piston
aircraft engines are sold under the Lycoming name directly to
general aviation airframe manufacturers and in the aftermarket
through domestic and international distributors. Lycoming also
is the exclusive supplier of engines for Cessna’s product
line of new single engine aircraft.

Cessna Segment

Based on unit sales, Cessna Aircraft Company is
the world’s largest manufacturer of general aviation
aircraft. Cessna currently has four major product lines:
Citation business jets, single engine turboprop Caravans, Cessna
single engine piston aircraft and after-market services.
Cessna’s revenues accounted for approximately 23%, 31% and
25% of our total revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The family of business jets currently produced by
Cessna includes the Citation CJ1, Citation CJ2, Citation Bravo,
Citation Encore, Citation Excel, and Citation X. The
Citation X is the world’s fastest business jet with a
maximum operating speed of Mach .92. By the end of 2003,
Cessna had delivered its 4,064th business jet. Under development
are the mid-size Citation Sovereign, the light-size Citation CJ3
and entry-level Citation Mustang. First customer deliveries are
scheduled in early 2004 for the Citation Sovereign and late 2004
for the Citation CJ3. First customer deliveries of the Citation
Mustang are anticipated in late 2006. In the second quarter of
2004, Cessna will begin deliveries of the XLS, which is a
faster, longer-range, modernized version of the Excel, and the
2004 Citation X, which has an improved interior design.

The Cessna Caravan is the world’s best
selling utility turboprop. Through the end of 2003, more than
1,413 Caravans have been sold by Cessna since the first Caravan
was delivered in 1985. Caravans are offered in four models: the
Grand Caravan, the Super Cargomaster, the Caravan Floatplane and
the



Caravan 675. Caravans are used in the U.S.
primarily to carry overnight express package shipments.
International uses of Caravans include humanitarian flights,
tourism and freight.

Cessna now has six models in its single engine
piston product line: the four-place 172 Skyhawk, 172 Skyhawk SP,
182 Skylane and Turbo 182 Skylane, and the six-place 206
Stationair and T206 Turbo Stationair. By the end of 2003, Cessna
had delivered 4,915 single engine piston aircraft since
deliveries were restarted in 1997.

Reliability and product support are significant
factors in the sale of these aircraft. The Citation family of
aircraft is supported by 11 Citation Service Centers owned and
operated by Cessna, along with authorized independent service
stations and centers in more than 16 countries throughout the
world. The Cessna-owned Service Centers provide customers 24
hour a day service and maintenance. Cessna Caravan and single
engine piston customers receive product support through
independently owned service stations and 24 hour a day
spare parts support through Cessna.

Cessna markets its products worldwide primarily
through its own sales force, as well as through a network of
authorized independent sales representatives, depending upon the
product line. Cessna has several competitors in the business jet
market. Cessna’s aircraft compete with other aircraft that
vary in size, speed, range, capacity, handling characteristics
and price.

Cessna engages in the business jet fractional
ownership market through a joint venture with TAG Aviation S.A.,
a worldwide aircraft management and charter enterprise. This
joint venture, called CitationShares, began in late 2000.
Initially, it offered shares of Citation aircraft for operation
east of the Rocky Mountains. It has now expanded to the entire
contiguous United States.

Fastening Systems Segment

Our Fastening Systems segment, Textron Fastening
Systems (TFS), offers a full range of fastening
technologies — which include fasteners, engineered
assemblies and automation equipment — to global
customers in the aerospace, automotive, computer, construction,
electronics, electrical equipment, industrial equipment,
non-automotive transportation, telecommunications and white good
markets. Its customers are global and regional original
equipment manufacturers, contract producers, component
manufacturers and distributors. TFS provides products, services
and solutions that simplify manufacturing processes and maximize
efficiencies resulting in lower total system costs to its
customers. Revenues of TFS accounted for approximately 18%, 16%,
and 14% of our total revenues in 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively.

TFS is headquartered in Troy, Michigan, and has
facilities located in the following 17 countries:
Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan,
the U.K. and the U.S.

During the past year, TFS has reorganized its
previously separate businesses into one unified global
operation. TFS also has migrated to the single global Textron
Fastening Systems brand from its previous 27 product and
business brands, although it also continues to use several of
its older brands. This branding strategy is intended to provide
clarity to TFS’s worldwide customers while preserving some
of the product trade names that are well known to them.

TFS produces engineered threaded fasteners,
fastening automation and installation tools, cold formed
components, engineered and laser welded assemblies, blind
fastening systems and metal stampings. TFS’s Full Service
Provider approach integrates its product offering with such
supply chain management services as vendor managed inventory
programs, plant provider programs and global sourcing. TFS
provides a wide range of design and engineering services to its
customers, and also derives a portion of its revenue from
licensing selected intellectual property assets to third parties.

TFS has hundreds of competitors in the global
fastener market, in essentially three tiers: global
multinationals with a global market presence, typically strong
in a market or in one or more product lines; mid-sized regionals
with some global activity but primarily focused on regional
market; and small local firms with a limited range within a
particular product category. Competition is based primarily on
price,



quality, delivery, service, support and
reputation. In addition, larger customers of fastening systems
and engineered assemblies primarily tend to procure products and
services from the larger suppliers. TFS’s broad range of
products and customers and markets reduces its risk of a
business loss that would have a material adverse effect on
Textron.

Industrial Segment

The Industrial Segment is comprised of our
E-Z-GO, Jacobsen, Kautex, and Tools & Components businesses.
On August 1, 2003, Textron sold the OmniQuip telehandler
business to JLG Industries, Inc., completing the divesture of
all product lines of the OmniQuip business acquired by Textron
in 1999.

E-Z-GO

E-Z-GO designs, manufactures and sells golf cars
and off-road utility vehicles powered by electric and internal
combustion engines under the E-Z-Go name, as well as
multipurpose utility vehicles under the E-Z-Go and Cushman brand
names.

E-Z-GO’s commercial customers consist
primarily of golf courses, resort communities and
municipalities, as well as commercial and industrial users such
as airports and factories. E-Z-GO’s off-road utility
vehicles and golf cars are also sold into the consumer market.
Sales are made through a network of distributors and directly to
end-users. Many of E-Z-GO’s sales are financed through
Textron Financial Corporation.

E-Z-GO has two major competitors for golf cars,
and a number of smaller competitors for utility vehicles.
Competition is based primarily on price, quality, product
support, performance, reliability and reputation.

Jacobsen

Jacobsen designs, manufactures and sells
professional turf maintenance equipment, lawn care machinery and
specialized industrial vehicles. Major brand names include
Ransomes, Jacobsen, Cushman, Ryan, Steiner, Brouwer, Bunton and
Bob-Cat.

Jacobsen’s commercial customers consist
primarily of golf courses, resort communities and
municipalities, as well as commercial and industrial users such
as airports, factories and professional lawn care services.
Sales are made through a network of distributors and directly to
end-users. Many sales are financed through Textron Financial
Corporation.

Jacobsen has two major competitors for
professional turf maintenance equipment and a number of smaller
competitors for specialized industrial vehicles and professional
lawn care machinery. Competition is based primarily on price,
quality, product support, performance, reliability and
reputation.

Textron’s Energy and Williams business
reports through the Jacobsen management structure. Energy and
Williams designs and manufacturers hydraulic pumps, cylinders,
and valves for a variety of agricultural and industrial
equipment applications. Energy and Williams faces competition
from a number of large and small competitors based primarily on
price, quality, product support, performance, reliability and
reputation.

Kautex

Kautex, headquartered in Bonn, Germany, is a
leading global manufacturer of blow-molded fuel systems and
other blow-molded parts for automobile original equipment
manufacturers and other industrial customers throughout Europe,
North America, South America and parts of Asia. Kautex
manufactures fuel systems for Japanese OEMs through a
majority-owned joint venture in Japan. Through a wholly owned
subsidiary in Shanghai, China, Kautex supplies the growing
Chinese market. In North America, Kautex also produces metal
fuel systems and engine camshafts for the automotive market and
automatic assembly machines and systems, perishable tools and
abrasives, and hydraulic components for industrial



markets. In Germany, Kautex produces plastic
containers and sheeting for household and industrial uses.
Kautex also manufactures windshield and headlamp washer systems.

Revenues of Kautex accounted for approximately
15%, 12% and 9% of our total revenue in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Kautex has a number of competitors worldwide,
some of whom are owned by the automotive original equipment
manufacturers that comprise Kautex’s targeted customer
base. Competition is typically based on a number of factors
including price, quality, reputation, prior experience and
available manufacturing capacity.

Textron
Tools & Components

Textron Tools & Components includes our
Greenlee and Fluid & Power businesses.

Greenlee consists of Greenlee, Klauke, Tempo and
InteSys. Greenlee, Klauke, and Tempo manufacture powered
equipment, electrical test and measurement instruments, hand and
hydraulic powered tools, and electrical and fiber optic
connectors under the Greenlee, Fairmont, Klauke and Tempo brand
names. The products are principally used in the electrical
construction and maintenance, telecommunications and plumbing
industries, and are distributed through a global network of
sales representatives and distributors, and also directly to
home improvement retailers and original equipment manufacturers.

These products are sold to a variety of customers, including
original equipment manufacturers, governments, distributors and
end-users. Fluid & Power faces competition from other
manufacturers based primarily on price, quality, product
support, performance, reliability, delivery and reputation.

Finance
Segment

Our Finance segment consists of Textron Financial
Corporation and its subsidiaries. Textron Financial Corporation
is a diversified commercial finance company with core operations
in six segments:



•

Resort Finance

extends loans to developers of
    vacation interval resorts, secured primarily by notes receivable
    and interval inventory; and

•

Structured Capital

engages in tax-oriented, long-term
    leases of large-ticket equipment and real estate, primarily with
    investment grade lessees.

Textron Financial Corporation’s other
financial services and products include transaction syndication,
equipment appraisal and disposition, and portfolio servicing.
Some of these ancillary services are offered through Asset
Control LLC and TBS Business Services, Inc.

Textron Financial Corporation’s financing
activities are confined almost exclusively to secured lending
and leasing to commercial markets. Textron Financial
Corporation’s services are offered primarily in North
America. However, Textron Financial Corporation finances Textron
products worldwide, principally Bell helicopters and Cessna
aircraft.

In 2003, 2002 and 2001 Textron sales financed by
Textron Financial Corporation were $0.8 billion,
$1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Textron
also received proceeds in those years of $56 million,
$104 million and $62 million from the sale of
equipment from its manufacturing operations to Textron Financial
for use under operating lease agreements.

The commercial finance businesses in which
Textron Financial Corporation operates are highly fragmented and
extremely competitive. Textron Financial Corporation is subject
to competition from various types of financing institutions,
including banks, leasing companies, insurance companies,
commercial finance companies and finance operations of equipment
vendors. Competition within the commercial finance industry is
primarily focused on price, terms, structure and service.

Textron Financial Corporation’s largest
business risk is the collectibility of its finance receivable
portfolio. During 2003, and excluding transactions for which
Textron Financial Corporation has recourse to Textron (and for
which allowance for loan losses are established at the
manufacturing level), nonperforming assets, which include
nonaccrual finance receivables and repossessed assets, decreased
$52 million to 2.8% ($162 million) of finance assets
from 3.4% ($214 million) at December 28, 2002. The
most significant component of the decrease in 2003 relates to a
$43 million decline in liquidating portfolios. Textron
Financial Corporation estimates that nonperforming assets will
generally be in the range of 2% to 4% of finance assets
depending on economic conditions. The allowance for losses on
receivables as a percentage of nonaccrual finance receivables
was 78% at January 3, 2004, compared to 82% at
December 28, 2002. The decrease in the percentage in 2003
reflects management’s assessment of the adequacy of
collateral values supporting the changes in nonaccrual finance
receivables.

Backlog

Information regarding our backlog of government
and commercial orders at the end of the past two fiscal years is
contained on pages 19 through 21 of our 2003 Annual Report
to Shareholders. These pages are incorporated by reference into
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Approximately 54% of our total backlog of
$7.5 billion at January 3, 2004, represents orders
which are not expected to be filled within our 2004 fiscal year.
At January 3, 2004, approximately 93% of the total
government backlog of $1.9 billion was funded.

U.S. Government Contracts

In 2003, 14% of our consolidated revenues were
generated by or resulted from contracts with the
U.S. Government. U.S. Government business is subject to
competition, changes in procurement policies and regulations,
the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations,
world events, and the size and timing of programs in which
Textron may participate.

Our contracts with the U.S. Government
generally may be terminated in whole or in part at the
convenience of the U.S. Government or if we are in default.
If the U.S. Government terminates a contract for
convenience, we normally will be entitled to payment for
unreimbursed costs of performance for work



done under the contract plus profit on those
costs, adjusted to reflect any rate of loss had the contract
been completed, plus termination costs. If, however, the
U.S. Government terminates a contract for default,
generally: (a) we will be paid an agreed-upon amount for
manufacturing materials delivered and accepted, for the
protection and preservation of property, and for partially
completed products accepted by the U.S. Government;
(b) the U.S. Government will not be liable for our
costs with respect to unaccepted items and will be entitled to
repayment of advance payments and progress payments related to
the terminated portions of the contract; and (c) we will be
liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in
procuring undelivered items from another source.

Research and Development

Information regarding our research and
development expenditures is contained on pages 66 through 67 of
our 2003 Annual Report to Shareholders. These pages are
incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Patents and Trademarks

We own, or are licensed under, numerous patents
throughout the world relating to products, services and methods
of manufacturing. Patents have been of value in the past and are
expected to be of value in the future. However, the loss of any
single patent or group of patents would not, in our opinion,
materially affect the conduct of our business.

We also own trademarks, trade names and service
marks that are important to our business. Some of these
trademarks, trade names and service marks are used in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K including: APCO; AB139; BA609;
Bell Helicopter; Benzlers; Bob-Cat; Boesner; Brouwer; BSK;

182 Skylane; V-22 Osprey; these marks and their related
trademark designs and logotypes (and variations of the
foregoing) are trademarks, trade names or service marks of
Textron Inc., its subsidiaries, affiliates, or joint ventures.

Environmental Considerations

Our operations are subject to numerous laws and
regulations designed to protect the environment. Compliance with
these laws and expenditures for environmental control facilities
have not had a material effect on our capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position. Additional information
regarding environmental matters is contained on pages 31
through 32 of our 2003 Annual Report to Shareholders. These
pages are incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Employees

At January 3, 2004, we had approximately
43,000 employees.

Item 2.

Properties

On January 3, 2004, we operated a total of
119 plants located throughout the U.S. and 88 plants outside the
U.S. Of the total of 207 plants, we owned 109 and the balance
were leased. In the aggregate, the total manufacturing space was
approximately 36.8 million square feet.

In addition, we own or lease offices, warehouse
and other space at various locations throughout the U.S. and
outside the U.S. We consider the productive capacity of the
plants operated by each of our business segments to be adequate.
In general, our facilities are in good condition, are considered
to be adequate for the uses to which they are being put, and are
substantially in regular use.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

Two identical lawsuits purporting to be class
actions were filed in 2002 in the United States District Court
in Rhode Island against Textron and certain present and former
officers of Textron and Bell Helicopter by Textron shareholders
suing on their own behalf and on behalf of a purported class of
Textron shareholders. A consolidated amended complaint alleges
that the defendants failed to make certain accounting
adjustments in response to alleged problems with Bell
Helicopter’s V-22 and H-1 programs and that the company
failed to timely write down certain assets of its OmniQuip unit.
The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages. Textron
filed a Motion to Dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on
March 26, 2003, and that motion currently is pending.
Textron believes the lawsuit is without merit and intends to
continue to defend it vigorously.



Two identical lawsuits, purporting to be class
actions on behalf of Textron benefit plans and participants and
beneficiaries of those plans during 2000 and 2001, were filed in
2002 in the United States District Court in Rhode Island against
Textron, the Textron Savings Plan and the Plan’s trustee. A
consolidated amended complaint alleges breach of certain
fiduciary duties under ERISA, based on the amount of Plan assets
invested in Textron stock during 2000 and 2001. The complaint
seeks equitable relief and compensatory damages on behalf of
various Textron benefit plans and the participants and
beneficiaries of those plans during 2000 and 2001 to compensate
for alleged losses relating to Textron stock held as an asset of
those plans. Textron’s Motion to Dismiss the consolidated
amended complaint was granted on June 24, 2003. Plaintiffs
filed a notice of appeal of the dismissal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit on July 23, 2003, and that
appeal currently is pending.

We are subject to actual and threatened legal
proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business. These
proceedings include claims arising from private transactions,
government contracts, product liability, employment and
environmental, safety and health matters. Some of these legal
proceedings seek damages, fines or penalties in substantial
amounts or remediation of environmental contamination. Under
federal government procurement regulations, certain claims
brought by the U.S. Government could result in our suspension or
debarment from U.S. Government contracting for a period of time.
On the basis of information presently available, we believe that
these legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our
financial position or results of operations.
