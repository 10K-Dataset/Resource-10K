PART I

Item 1. Business of Textron

Textron Inc. is a global multi-industry company with
operations in 33 countries and with approximately 37,000 employees in our
continuing operations. Our business was founded in 1923 and reincorporated in
Delaware on July 31, 1967. Today, we leverage our global network of
aircraft, industrial and finance businesses to provide customers with
innovative solutions and services.

Business Segments

We operate in four business segments – Bell, Cessna,
Industrial and Finance. Our business segments include operations that are
unincorporated divisions of Textron Inc. or its subsidiaries and others that
are separately incorporated subsidiaries. A description of the business done
and intended to be done by each of our business segments is set forth below.
Financial information by business segment and geographic area appears in Note
21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 74 through 75 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. We also continue to operate in the Fastening
Systems business, which was classified as a discontinued operation for
financial reporting purposes in the fourth quarter of 2005.

Bell Segment

The Bell segment is comprised of Bell Helicopter and
Textron Systems.

Bell Helicopter

Bell Helicopter is one of the largest suppliers of
helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and helicopter-related spare parts and
services in the world. Bell Helicopter manufactures for both military and
commercial applications. Bell Helicopter’s revenues accounted for approximately
21%, 19% and 22% of our total revenues from continuing operations in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

Bell Helicopter supplies advanced military
helicopters and support (including spare parts, support equipment, technical
data, trainers, pilot and maintenance training, component repairs, aircraft
modifications, contractor maintenance and field and product support engineering
services) to the U.S. Government and to military customers outside the United
States. Bell Helicopter is one of the leading suppliers of helicopters to the
U.S. Government and, in association with The Boeing Company, the only supplier
of military tiltrotor aircraft. Bell Helicopter is teamed with The Boeing
Company to develop, produce and support the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft for
the U.S. Department of Defense. Tiltrotor aircraft are designed to provide the
benefits of both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Through Production Lot 9,
the U.S. Government has issued contracts for 83 production V-22 aircraft. The V-22
Operational Evaluation (“OPEVAL”) was successfully completed in 2005, which led
to an Acquisition Decision Memorandum that authorized full-rate production for
the V-22 in future production lots.

Bell Helicopter is nearing completion of the
Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase of the H-1 Upgrade Program for
the U.S. Marine Corps. This program will produce an advanced attack and a
utility model helicopter, the AH-1Z and UH-1Y, respectively, both of which are
designed to have 84% parts commonality, which meets the U.S. Government’s
intent to reduce operational life cycle costs. Bell delivered the first two
aircraft for OPEVAL training in October, and the OPEVAL is planned to begin
shortly after the delivery of the remaining two aircraft in 2006. The U.S.
Government has issued contracts for the production of ten UH-1Y aircraft and
six AH-1Z aircraft through Low Rate Initial Production (“LRIP”) of Lots 1 and
2. This program calls for a total of 280 production units.

In July 2005, Bell Helicopter was awarded a U.S.
Government contract for System Development and Demonstration of the Armed
Reconnaissance Helicopter; this contract includes priced options for LRIP Lot 1
(6-12 aircraft) and Lot 2 (18-36 aircraft). This program calls for a total of
368 production units.

Bell Helicopter is also a leading supplier of
commercially certified helicopters to corporate, offshore petroleum exploration
and development, utility, charter, police, fire, rescue and emergency medical
helicopter operators.


Bell Helicopter is a member of Bell/Agusta Aerospace
Company LLC (“BAAC”), a joint venture with Agusta S.p.A. and two of its
affiliated companies (collectively, “Agusta”), a leading helicopter
manufacturer based in Italy, for the design, manufacture, sale and customer
support of the revolutionary civil tiltrotor aircraft, the Model BA609. On December 20,
2005, Bell Helicopter and Agusta entered into a realignment of BAAC under which
Bell sold its interest in the venture’s medium twin Model AB139 helicopter to
Agusta so that Bell could focus on its own medium twin products and BAAC could
focus exclusively on the Model BA609. The Model BA609 met a major milestone in
2005 by achieving forward flight in airplane mode for the first time. In 2005,
the Model BA609 also achieved speeds in excess of 220 miles per hour and an
altitude of over 15,000 feet.

Bell Helicopter and AgustaWestland North America Inc.
formed the AgustaWestlandBell LLC (“AWB LLC”) in January 2004 for the
joint design, development, manufacture, sale, customer training and product
support of the US101 helicopter and certain variations and derivatives thereof,
to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the U.S. Government. On January 28,
2005, Lockheed Martin, with AWB LLC as its principal subcontractor, was
selected to design, develop, manufacture and support the Presidential
helicopter for the U.S. Marine Corps Marine 1 Helicopter Squadron (VH-71)
Program. Bell Helicopter plans to assemble the production aircraft at its
Assembly & Integration Center in Amarillo, Texas.

Bell’s helicopter business competes against a number
of competitors based in the United States and other countries, and its spare
parts business competes against numerous competitors around the world.
Competition is based primarily on price, quality, product support, performance,
reliability and reputation.

Textron Systems

Textron Systems is a primary supplier to the defense,
aerospace and general aviation markets. Its principal strategy is to address
the emphasis being placed by the U.S. Department of Defense on network centric
warfare and the leveraging of advances in information technology by focusing on
the development and production of networked sensors, weapons and the associated
algorithms and software. Textron Systems manufactures “smart” weapons, airborne
and ground-based surveillance systems, aircraft landing systems, hovercraft,
search and rescue vessels, armored vehicles and turrets, reciprocating piston
aircraft engines, and aircraft and missile control actuators, valves and
related components. Textron Systems is involved in supplying the U.S. Air Force
with some of its premier smart weapons as prime contractor for the Sensor Fuzed
Weapon and is a subcontractor to The Boeing Company for tail actuation systems
on the Joint Direct Attack Munition and the next generation Small Diameter
Bomb. Textron Systems is a tier one supplier of unattended ground sensors and
intelligent munitions systems for the U.S. Army’s Future Combat System. While
Textron Systems sells most of its products directly to U.S. customers, it also
sells an increasing number of products in over 35 other countries through a
growing, global network of sales representatives and distributors.

Actuation products for the aerospace, defense and industrial
markets are sold under trade names of HR Textron and APCO. Specialty marine,
land vehicle and turret products are sold under the trade names of Textron
Marine & Land Systems and Cadillac Gage. The recognized need for
armored vehicles for secure transport of U.S. and other armed forces has
resulted in increased demand for the highly protected and cost effective
vehicles offered by Textron Systems. Weapons, surveillance and landing systems
are sold under the Textron Systems name. Reciprocating piston aircraft engines
are sold under the Lycoming name directly to general aviation airframe
manufacturers and in the aftermarket through domestic and international
distributors. Lycoming also is the exclusive supplier of engines for Cessna’s
product line of new single engine aircraft.

Textron Systems competes against a number of
competitors in the United States and other countries on the basis of
technology, performance, price, quality and reliability, product support,
installed base and reputation.

Cessna Segment

Based on unit sales, Cessna Aircraft Company is the
world’s largest manufacturer of general aviation aircraft. Cessna currently has
four major product lines: Citation business jets, single engine turboprop
Caravans, Cessna single engine piston aircraft and aftermarket services.
Revenues in the Cessna segment accounted for approximately 35%, 30% and 29% of
our total revenues from continuing operations in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The family of business jets currently produced by
Cessna includes the Citation CJ1, Citation CJ1+, Citation CJ2, Citation CJ3,
Citation Bravo, Citation Encore, Citation XLS, Citation Sovereign and Citation
X. The Citation X is the world’s fastest business jet with a maximum operating
speed of Mach .92. By the end of 2005, Cessna had delivered its 4,500th
business jet. Currently, the entry-level Citation Mustang is under development.
First customer deliveries of the Citation CJ1+, an upgrade to the CJ1,
commenced in December 2005, and customer deliveries of the Citation CJ2+,
an upgrade to the CJ2, are scheduled to commence in 2006. The first Mustang
that will be finished on the production line at our


Independence, Kansas facility will be delivered to
Cessna’s marketing department as a demonstrator in 2006. The first customer
delivery of the Mustang will be in 2007. First deliveries of the Encore+, an
upgrade of the Citation Encore, are scheduled to commence in 2007.

The Cessna Caravan is the world’s best selling utility
turboprop. Through the end of 2005, more than 1,565 Caravans have been sold by
Cessna since the first Caravan was delivered in 1985. Caravans are offered in
three models: the Grand Caravan, the Super Cargomaster and the Caravan 675.
Caravans are used in the United States. primarily to carry overnight express
package shipments and also are used for personal transportation. International
uses of Caravans include humanitarian flights, tourism and freight transport.

Cessna now has six models in its single engine piston
product line: the four-place 172 Skyhawk and 172 Skyhawk SP, 182 Skylane and
Turbo 182 Skylane, and the six-place 206 Stationair and T206 Turbo Stationair.
Certification of the Garmin 1000 (“G1000”) avionics package has been completed
for all single engine models. By the end of 2005, Cessna had delivered 6,382
single engine piston aircraft since deliveries were restarted in 1997.

The Citation family of aircraft is currently
supported by a total of 10 Citation Service Centers owned and operated by
Cessna, along with authorized independent service stations and centers in more
than 18 countries throughout the world. The Wichita Citation Service Center is
the world’s largest general aviation maintenance facility. The Cessna-owned
Service Centers provide customers 24-hour service and maintenance. Cessna also
provides 24-hour spare parts support for Citation aircraft. Cessna Caravan and
single engine piston customers receive product support through independently
owned service stations and 24-hour spare parts support through Cessna.

Cessna markets its products worldwide primarily
through its own sales force, as well as through a network of authorized
independent sales representatives, depending upon the product line. Cessna has
several competitors in various market segments. Cessna’s aircraft compete with
other aircraft that vary in size, speed, range, capacity, handling
characteristics and price.

Cessna engages in the business jet fractional
ownership market through a joint venture with TAG Aviation USA, Inc., a
worldwide aircraft management and charter enterprise. This joint venture,
called CitationShares, began in late 2000 and offers shares of Citation
aircraft for operation in the entire contiguous United States, and in Canada,
Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and Bermuda. CitationShares also has a
limited advance purchase jet aircraft charter offering, called the Vector
Jetcard. Cessna’s current ownership interest in CitationShares is 82.2%.

Industrial Segment

The Industrial segment is comprised of our E-Z-GO,
Jacobsen, Kautex, Greenlee and Fluid & Power businesses.

E-Z-GO

E-Z-GO designs, manufactures and sells golf cars and
off-road utility vehicles powered by electric and internal combustion engines
under the E-Z-GO name, as well as multipurpose utility vehicles under the
E-Z-GO and Cushman brand names.

E-Z-GO’s commercial customers consist primarily of
golf courses, resort communities and municipalities, as well as commercial and
industrial users such as airports and factories. E-Z-GO’s off-road utility
vehicles and golf cars are also sold into the consumer market. Sales are made
through a network of distributors and directly to end users. Many of E-Z-GO’s
sales are financed through Textron Financial Corporation.

E-Z-GO has two major competitors for golf cars and
several other competitors for utility vehicles. Competition is based primarily
on price, quality, product support, performance, reliability and reputation.

Jacobsen

Jacobsen designs, manufactures and sells professional
turf maintenance equipment, lawn care machinery and specialized industrial
vehicles. Major brand names include Ransomes, Jacobsen, Cushman, Ryan, Steiner,
Brouwer, Bunton and Bob-Cat.

Jacobsen’s commercial customers consist primarily of
golf courses, resort communities and municipalities, as well as commercial and
industrial users such as airports, factories and professional lawn care
services. Sales are made through a network of distributors and directly to end
users. Many sales are financed through Textron Financial Corporation.

Jacobsen has two major competitors for professional
turf maintenance equipment and several other competitors for specialized
industrial vehicles and professional lawn care machinery. Competition is based
primarily on price, quality, product support, performance, reliability and
reputation.


Kautex

Kautex, headquartered in Bonn, Germany, is a leading
global manufacturer of blow-molded fuel systems and other blow-molded parts for
automobile original equipment manufacturers and, to a lesser extent, other
industrial customers. Kautex operates plants near its major customers all
around the world. Kautex is also a leading supplier of windshield and headlamp
washer systems in the original equipment automobile market. In North America,
Kautex produces metal fuel fillers and engine camshafts for the automotive
market. In Germany, Kautex produces plastic containers for household and
industrial uses.

Revenues of Kautex accounted for approximately 15%,
19% and 18% of our total revenues from continuing operations in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Kautex has a number of competitors worldwide, some of
whom are owned by the automotive original equipment manufacturers that compose
Kautex’s targeted customer base. Competition is typically based on a number of
factors, including price, quality, reputation, prior experience and available
manufacturing capacity.

Greenlee

Greenlee consists of Greenlee, Klauke and Tempo.
These companies manufacture powered equipment, electrical test and measurement
instruments, hand and hydraulic powered tools, and electrical and fiber optic
connectors under the Greenlee, Fairmont, Klauke, Progressive and Tempo brand
names. The products are principally used in the electrical construction and
maintenance, telecommunications and plumbing industries. Greenlee distributes
its products through a global network of sales representatives and
distributors, and also directly to home improvement retailers and original
equipment manufacturers. Rothenberger L.L.C., a 50-50 joint venture between
Greenlee Plumbing Inc. and Rothenberger USA, Inc., a subsidiary of
Rothenberger AG, sells hand and powered tools for the plumbing and mechanical
industries in North America. The Greenlee businesses face competition from
numerous manufacturers based primarily on price, quality, performance,
reliability, delivery and reputation.

Fluid & Power

Fluid & Power consists of four product
lines: Gear Technologies, Hydrocarbon Processing Products, Polymer Systems and
Hydraulics. Gear Technologies designs and manufactures industrial gears,
mechanical transmission systems, worm gear speed reducers, screwjacks, gear

under the David Brown Union Pump and David Brown Guinard Pump brands. Polymer
Systems designs and manufactures industrial pumps, extrusion equipment and
screen changers for the polymer industry under the Maag brand name. Hydraulics
designs, manufactures and sells hydraulic pumps, valves and pilot controls
under the David Brown, Hydreco and Powauto brands. These products are sold to a
variety of customers, including original equipment manufacturers, governments,
distributors and end users. Fluid & Power faces competition from other
manufacturers based primarily on price, quality, product support, performance,
reliability, delivery and reputation.

Finance Segment

Our Finance segment consists of Textron Financial
Corporation and its subsidiaries. Textron Financial Corporation is a
diversified commercial finance company with core operations in six markets:

•

Aircraft Finance

provides financing for new and used Cessna
business jets, single engine turboprops, piston-engine airplanes, Bell
helicopters and other general aviation aircraft;

•

Asset-Based Lending

provides asset-based loans to middle-market
companies in several industries, and provides factoring arrangements primarily
for freight companies;

•

Distribution Finance

primarily offers inventory finance programs
for dealers of products manufactured by Textron and for dealers of a variety of
other household, housing, leisure, agricultural and technology products;

•

Golf Finance

primarily makes mortgage loans for the
acquisition and refinancing of golf courses and provides term financing for
E-Z-GO golf cars and Jacobsen turf-care equipment;

•

Resort Finance

primarily extends loans to developers of
vacation interval resorts, secured primarily by notes receivable and interval
inventory; and

•

Structured Capital

primarily engages in long-term leases of
large-ticket equipment and real estate, primarily with investment grade
lessees.


Textron Financial Corporation’s other financial
services and products include transaction syndication, equipment appraisal and
disposition, and portfolio servicing offered through Textron Business Services, Inc.

Textron Financial Corporation’s financing activities
are confined almost exclusively to secured lending and leasing to commercial
markets. Textron Financial Corporation’s services are offered primarily in
North America. However, Textron Financial Corporation finances certain Textron
products worldwide, principally Bell helicopters and Cessna aircraft.

In 2005, 2004 and 2003, Textron Financial Corporation
paid Textron $0.8 billion, $0.9 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively,
relating to the sale of manufactured products to third parties that were
financed by Textron Financial Corporation. Textron also received proceeds in
those years of $41 million, $77 million and $56 million, respectively, from the
sale of equipment from its manufacturing operations to Textron Financial for
use under operating lease agreements.

The commercial finance environment in which Textron
Financial Corporation operates is highly fragmented and extremely competitive.
Textron Financial Corporation is subject to competition from various types of
financing institutions, including banks, leasing companies, insurance
companies, commercial finance companies and finance operations of equipment
vendors. Competition within the commercial finance industry is primarily
focused on price, terms, structure and service.

Textron Financial Corporation’s largest business risk
is the collectibility of its finance receivable portfolio. See “Finance
Portfolio Quality” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations on page 23 for a detailed discussion
of the credit quality of this portfolio.

Discontinued Operations – Fastening
Systems

In December 2005, we committed to a plan to sell
our Fastening Systems business, Textron Fastening Systems (“TFS”), in its
entirety. This plan was approved by our Board of Directors on December 7,
2005, and the results of operations for TFS are now reported as discontinued
operations for financial reporting purposes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information.

TFS offers a full range of fastening technologies –
which include fasteners, engineered assemblies and automation equipment – to
global customers in the aerospace, automotive, computer, construction,
electronics, electrical equipment, industrial equipment, non-automotive
transportation, telecommunications and white good markets. Its customers are
global and regional original equipment manufacturers, contract producers,
component manufacturers and distributors. TFS provides products, services and
solutions that simplify manufacturing processes and maximize efficiencies
resulting in lower total system costs to its customers.

Revenues of TFS totaled $1.9 billion, $1.9 billion
and $1.7 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are recorded within
discontinued operations.

TFS is headquartered in Troy, Michigan, and has
facilities located in the following 17 countries: Australia, Austria, Brazil,
Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico,
Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

TFS produces engineered threaded fasteners, fastening
automation and installation tools, cold formed components, engineered
assemblies, blind fastening systems and metal stampings, and sells the new
Intevia intelligent fastening system. TFS’ Full Service Provider approach
integrates its product offering with supply chain management services such as
vendor managed inventory programs, plant provider programs and global sourcing.
TFS provides a wide range of design and engineering services to its customers,
and derives a portion of its income from licensing selected intellectual
property assets to third parties.

TFS has hundreds of competitors in the global
fastener market in essentially three tiers: global multinationals with a global
market presence, typically strong in a market or in one or more product lines;
mid-sized regionals with some global activity but primarily focused on regional
markets; and small local firms with a limited range within a particular product
category. Competition is based primarily on price, quality, delivery, service,
support and reputation. TFS’ broad range of products, customers and markets
reduces its risk of a business loss that would have a material adverse effect
on Textron Inc.


Backlog

U.S. Government backlog was $3.3 billion at the end
of 2005 and 2004, including backlog at Bell Helicopter of $2.2 billion in 2005
and $2.5 billion in 2004. Approximately 98% of the 2005 backlog was funded at December 31,
2005. Unfunded backlog represents the award value of U.S. Government contracts
received, generally related to cost-plus type contracts, in excess of the
funding formally appropriated by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government is obligated
only up to the funded amount of the contract. Additional funding is
appropriated as the contract progresses.

Commercial backlog from unaffiliated customers was
$7.4 billion and $6.3 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively, including backlog
at Cessna of $6.3 billion in 2005 and $5.3 billion in 2004. A significant
portion of Cessna’s backlog represents orders from a major fractional jet
customer. Orders from this fractional aircraft operator are included in backlog
when the customer enters into a definitive master agreement and has established
preliminary delivery dates for the aircraft. Preliminary delivery dates are
subject to change through amendment to the master agreement. Final delivery
dates are established approximately 12 to 18 months prior to delivery. Orders
from other customers are included in backlog upon the customer entering into a
definitive purchase order and receipt of required deposits.

The 2005 year-end backlog with the major fractional
jet customer was approximately $1.5 billion. The remaining $4.8 billion of
Cessna’s backlog at the end of 2005 is with other commercial customers covering
a wide spectrum of industries. This backlog includes $0.6 billion in orders for
the new Mustang aircraft with the first customer deliveries in 2007.

Approximately 45% of our total backlog of $10.7
billion at December 31, 2005 represents orders which are not expected to
be filled within our 2006 fiscal year.

U.S. Government Contracts

In 2005, 18% of our consolidated revenues were
generated by or resulted from contracts with the U.S. Government. This business
is subject to competition, changes in procurement policies and regulations, the
continuing availability of Congressional appropriations, world events, and the
size and timing of programs in which we may participate.

Our contracts with the U.S. Government generally may
be terminated by the U.S. Government for convenience or default in whole or in
part. If the U.S. Government terminates a contract for convenience, we normally
will be entitled to payment for the cost of contract work performed before the
effective date of termination plus reasonable profit on such work, adjusted to
reflect any rate of loss had the contract been completed, plus reasonable costs
of settlement of the work terminated. If, however, the U.S. Government
terminates a contract for default, generally: (a) we will be paid the
contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted, an agreed-upon
amount for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection
and preservation of property, and for partially completed products accepted by
the U.S. Government; (b) the U.S. Government will not be liable for our
costs with respect to unaccepted items and will be entitled to repayment of
advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of
the contract; and (c) we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the
U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source.

Research and Development

Information regarding our research and development
expenditures is contained in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
on page 74 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Patents and Trademarks

We own, or are licensed under, numerous patents
throughout the world relating to products, services and methods of
manufacturing. Patents have been of value in the past and are expected to be of
value in the future. However, the loss of any single patent or group of patents
would not, in our opinion, materially affect the conduct of our business. We
also own or license trademarks, trade names and service marks that are
important to our business. Some of these trademarks, trade names and service
marks are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports,
including: 429; AB Benzlers; AH-1Z; APCO; BA609; Bell/Agusta Aerospace Company,

(and variations of the foregoing) are trademarks, trade names or service marks
of Textron Inc., its subsidiaries, affiliates or joint ventures.

Environmental Considerations

Our operations are subject to numerous laws and
regulations designed to protect the environment. Compliance with these laws and
expenditures for environmental control facilities have not had a material
effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Additional information regarding environmental matters is contained in Note 17
to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

Employees

At December 31, 2005, we had approximately
37,000 employees in our continuing operations and approximately 9,000 employees
in the discontinued operations of our Textron Fastening Systems business.

Available Information

We make available free of charge on our Internet
website (http://www.textron.com) our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to
those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we
electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Our business, financial condition and results of
operations are subject to various risks, including those discussed below, which
may affect the value of our securities. The risks discussed below are those
that we believe are currently the most significant, although additional risks
not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also
impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps
materially.

We may be unable to effectively
mitigate pricing pressures.

In some markets, particularly where we deliver
component products and services to original equipment manufacturers, we face
ongoing customer demands for price reductions, which are sometimes
contractually obligated. In some cases, we are able to offset these reductions
through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved
operating and supply chain efficiencies. However, if we are unable to
effectively mitigate future pricing pressures, our financial results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Delays in aircraft delivery
schedules or cancellation of orders may adversely affect our financial results.

Aircraft customers, including sellers of fractional
share interests, may respond to weak economic conditions by delaying delivery
of orders or canceling orders. Weakness in the economy may also result in fewer
hours flown on existing aircraft and, consequently, lower demand for spare
parts and maintenance. Weak economic conditions may also cause reduced demand
for used business jets. We may accept used aircraft on trade-in that would be
subject to fluctuations in the fair market value of the aircraft while in
inventory. Reduced demand for new and used business jets, spare parts and
maintenance can have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations.

Developing new products and
technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties.

Delays or cost overruns in the development and
acceptance of new products, or certification of new aircraft products and other
products, could affect our financial results of operations. These delays could
be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles, production changes to meet
customer demands, coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the
part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed. We also could be
adversely affected if the general efficacy of our research and development
investments to develop products is less than expected.

We have customer concentration with
the U.S. Government.

During 2005, we derived approximately 18% of our
revenue from sales to a variety of U.S. Government entities. Our ability to compete
successfully for and retain this business is highly dependent on technical
excellence, management proficiency, strategic alliances, cost-effective
performance and the ability to recruit and retain key personnel. U.S.
Government programs are subject to uncertain future funding levels, which can


result in the extension or termination of programs. Our
business is also highly sensitive to changes in national and international
priorities and U.S. Government budgets.

U.S. Government contracts may be
terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions.

The U.S. Government typically can terminate or modify
any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by
failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. A termination
arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have an adverse
effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.

If any of our contracts are terminated by the U.S.
Government, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining
terms of such contracts, and our financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely affected. In addition, on those contracts for which we are
teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could
terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of
the quality of our services as a subcontractor.

In addition to unfavorable termination provisions,
our U.S. Government contracts contain provisions that allow the U.S. Government
to unilaterally suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of
alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations, reduce the value of
existing contracts, issue modifications to a contract, and control and
potentially prohibit the export of our products, services and associated
materials.

Cost overruns on U.S. Government
contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business.

Contract and program accounting require judgment
relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making
assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature
of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at
completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be
made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs include
expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Incentives or penalties
related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and
profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to
assess anticipated performance. Estimates of award fees are also used in
estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards.

Because of the significance of the estimates
described above, it is likely that different amounts could be recorded if we
used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely
affect our future financial results of operations.

Under fixed-price contracts, we receive a fixed price
irrespective of the actual costs we incur, and consequently, any costs in
excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us. Under time and materials
contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for
certain expenses. Under cost reimbursement contracts, which are subject to a
contract-ceiling amount, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee,
which may be fixed or performance based. However, if our costs exceed the
contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or
applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such
costs. Under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs we incur
in performing under the contract, our financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected. Cost overruns also may adversely affect
our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards.

We may make acquisitions that
increase the risks of our business.

We may enter into acquisitions in the future in an
effort to enhance shareholder value. Acquisitions involve a certain amount of
risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected
benefits. Such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired
businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner; challenges
in achieving expected strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits;
the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and
that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful
in those markets; the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the
future results of operations would have merited; the potential loss of key
employees of the acquired businesses; and the risk of diverting the attention
of senior management from our existing operations.

Our operations could be adversely
affected by interruptions of production that are beyond our control.

Our business and financial results may be affected by
certain events that we cannot anticipate or that are beyond our control, such
as natural disasters and national emergencies, that could curtail production at
our facilities and cause delayed deliveries and cancelled orders. In addition,
we purchase components and raw materials from numerous suppliers, and even if
our facilities are not directly affected by such events, we could be affected
by interruptions of production at such suppliers. Such suppliers may be less
likely than our own facilities to be able to quickly recover from such events,
and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit
their ability to conduct their operations.


Our business could be adversely
affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues.

Approximately 18,500 of our employees are unionized,
which represented approximately 40% of our employees at December 31, 2005,
including employees of the discontinued business of Textron Fastening Systems.
As a result, we may experience work stoppages, which could negatively impact
our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, resulting in strain
on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues. In addition,
the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive
pressures in the marketplace, which could have an adverse effect on our
financial results of operations.

In addition to our workforce, the workforces of many
of our customers and suppliers are represented by labor unions. Work stoppages or
strikes at the plants of our key customers could result in delayed or cancelled
orders for our products. Work stoppages and strikes at the plants of our
key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes. Any of these results
could adversely affect our financial results of operations.

Our Textron Finance borrowing group’s
business is dependent on its continuing access to the capital markets.

Our financings are conducted through two borrowing
groups, Textron Finance and Textron Manufacturing. Textron Finance consists of
Textron Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries, which are the entities
through which we operate in the Finance segment. Textron Finance relies on its
access to the capital markets to fund asset growth, fund operations and meet debt
obligations and other commitments. Textron Finance raises funds through
commercial paper borrowings, issuances of medium-term notes and other term debt
securities, and syndication and securitization of receivables. Additional
liquidity is provided to Textron Finance through bank lines of credit. Much of
the capital markets funding is made possible by the maintenance of credit
ratings that are acceptable to investors. If the credit ratings of Textron
Finance were to be lowered, it might face higher borrowing costs, a disruption
of its access to the capital markets or both. Textron Finance could also lose
access to financing for other reasons, such as a general disruption of the
capital markets. Any disruption of Textron Finance’s access to the capital markets
could adversely affect its business and our profitability.

If Textron Finance is unable to
maintain portfolio credit quality, our financial performance could be adversely
affected.

A key determinant of financial performance at Textron
Finance will be its ability to maintain the quality of loans, leases and other
credit products in its finance asset portfolios. Portfolio quality may
adversely be affected by several factors, including finance receivable
underwriting procedures, collateral quality, geographic or industry
concentrations, or general economic downturns. Any inability by Textron Finance
to successfully collect its finance receivable portfolio and to resolve problem
accounts may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, and financial condition.

We are subject to legal proceedings
and other claims.

We are subject to legal proceedings and other claims
arising out of the conduct of our business, including proceedings and claims
relating to private sector transactions; government contracts; production
partners; product liability; employment; and environmental contamination. Under
federal government procurement regulations, certain claims brought by the U.S.
Government could result in our being suspended or debarred from U.S. Government
contracting for a period of time. On the basis of information presently
available, we do not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a
material effect on our financial position or results of operations. However,
litigation is inherently unpredictable, and we could incur judgments or enter
into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our
financial position or our results of operations in any particular period.

The levels of our reserves are
subject to many uncertainties and may not be adequate to cover writedowns or
losses.

In addition to reserves at Textron Finance, we
establish reserves in our manufacturing segments to cover uncollectible
accounts receivable, excess or obsolete inventory, fair market value writedowns
on used aircraft and golf cars, recall campaigns, warranty costs and
litigation. These reserves are subject to adjustment from time to time
depending on actual experience and are subject to many uncertainties, including
bankruptcy or other financial problems at key customers.

In the case of litigation matters for which reserves
have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable, it is
reasonably possible such matters could be decided against us and could require
us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently
estimable.

The effect on our financial results of many of these
factors depends in some cases on our ability to obtain insurance covering
potential losses at reasonable rates.


Currency, raw material price and
interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks,
including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, raw
material prices and interest rates. We monitor and manage these exposures as an
integral part of our overall risk management program. In some cases, we
purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our financial results
of operations from these fluctuations. Nevertheless, changes in currency
exchange rates, raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial
adverse effects on our financial results of operations.

The increasing costs of certain
employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results.

Our earnings and cash flow may be impacted by the
amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans.
This is particularly true for our pension plans, which are dependent on actual
plan asset returns and factors used to determine the value and current costs of
plan benefit obligations.

In addition, medical costs are rising at a rate
faster than the general inflation rate. Continued medical cost inflation in
excess of the general inflation rate increases the risk that we will not be
able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits. Increases to the costs
of pension and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial
results of operations.

Unanticipated changes in Textron’s
tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our
profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United
States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international
tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different
jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes
in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes
in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or in tax laws, which
could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred
tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. In
addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various
jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our
profitability.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None

Item 2. Properties

In December 2005, our Board of Directors
authorized the divestiture of the Textron Fastening Systems business as
discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31,
2005, the Fastening Systems business included 19 plants located throughout the
United States and 20 plants outside of the United States. Of the total of 39
plants operated in the Fastening Systems business, we owned 28, with the
balance leased, and had total manufacturing space of approximately 10.7 million
square feet.

On December 31, 2005, excluding Textron
Fastening Systems’ plants, we operated a total of 77 plants located throughout
the United States and 58 plants outside the United States. Of the total of 135
plants, we owned 65 and the balance was leased. In the aggregate, the total
manufacturing space was approximately 21.4 million square feet.

We also own or lease offices, warehouse and other space
at various locations. We consider the productive capacity of the plants
operated by each of our business segments to be adequate. In general, our
facilities are in good condition, are considered to be adequate for the uses to
which they are being put and are substantially in regular use.


Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Two identical lawsuits purporting to be class actions
were filed in 2002 in the United States District Court in Rhode Island against
Textron and certain present and former officers of Textron and Bell Helicopter
by Textron shareholders suing on their own behalf and on behalf of a purported
class of Textron shareholders. A consolidated amended complaint alleged that
the defendants failed to make certain accounting adjustments in response to
alleged problems with Bell Helicopter’s V-22 and H-1 programs and that the
company failed to timely write down certain assets of its OmniQuip unit. The
complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages. On June 15, 2004, the
District Court ruled that the plaintiffs could not maintain the claims that
were based on allegations relating to the

H-1 program or to OmniQuip, and also ruled that all claims against one of the
individual defendants should be dismissed. The District Court certified the
class of shareholders on May 11, 2005. All claims in the litigation were
subsequently settled for a cash amount to be paid by Textron’s insurer. The
settlement was preliminarily approved by the District Court on January 31,
2006.

Separately, two identical lawsuits, purporting to be
class actions on behalf of Textron benefit plans and participants and
beneficiaries of those plans during 2000 and 2001, were filed in 2002 in the
United States District Court in Rhode Island against Textron, the Textron
Savings Plan and the Plan’s trustee. A consolidated amended complaint alleges
breach of certain fiduciary duties under ERISA, based on the amount of Plan
assets invested in Textron stock during 2000 and 2001. The complaint seeks
equitable relief and compensatory damages on behalf of various Textron benefit
plans and the participants and beneficiaries of those plans during 2000 and
2001 to compensate for alleged losses relating to Textron stock held as an
asset of those plans. Textron’s Motion to Dismiss the consolidated amended
complaint was granted on June 24, 2003. On May 7, 2004, the United
States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed dismissal of all claims
against the Plan’s trustee and against the Plan itself, and also affirmed
dismissal of certain other claims against Textron. However, the Court of
Appeals ruled that plaintiffs should be permitted to attempt to develop their
breach of fiduciary duty claims, and remanded those claims to the District
Court. Textron believes this lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend
this action vigorously.

We are subject to actual and threatened legal
proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business. These proceedings
include claims arising from private transactions, government contracts, product
liability, employment and environmental, safety and health matters. Some of
these legal proceedings seek damages, fines or penalties in substantial amounts
or remediation of environmental contamination. Under federal government
procurement regulations, certain claims brought by the U.S. Government could
result in our suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting for a
period of time. On the basis of information presently available, we believe
that these legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

Textron Inc. is a multi-industry company that
leverages its global network of businesses to provide customers with innovative
solutions and services in four business segments: Bell, Cessna, Industrial and
Finance. Textron is known around the world for its powerful brands spanning the
business jet, aerospace and defense, plastic fuel systems, golf car and
turf-care markets, among others.

The global economy continued to grow in most of our
major markets in 2005, despite early weakness in some regions, including parts
of Europe. The U.S. economy, in particular, proved resilient in the face of
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Overall capital spending continued to grow at a
steady and sustainable rate. Our company’s performance is strongly related to
this key economic factor, which reflects investments in longer lasting items
such as equipment, facilities and vehicles.

We had strong sales in 2005 – particularly in our
aerospace and defense businesses. We were able to deliver exceptional organic
growth (gains from existing business, excluding the effects of acquisitions and
other changes) of 19%, which is the result of our commitment to bringing new
products and services to our customers. Orders were strong, most notably at
Bell, where a steady flow of military orders resulted from continued spending
in the defense sector and we received robust orders in our commercial
helicopter business. Cessna also saw a significant increase in new business jet
orders as a result of strength in the aircraft sector and the popularity of its
new model introductions, and our Finance segment experienced significant
improvement in its portfolio credit quality with fewer charge-offs and a
decrease in nonperforming assets. However, Industrial volumes were down
slightly from 2004 largely due to a downturn in the North American automotive
industry.

While we were impacted by inflation and higher
pension costs in 2005, we were able to absorb the impact of these factors
primarily as a result of the increased volumes and the benefit of our
transformation strategy to reduce costs, introduce new products and enhance our
portfolio of businesses. We will continue to execute our transformation
strategy and position Textron to take advantage of the improved economic
conditions.

To strengthen our overall position in our markets, we
have continued to improve upon our portfolio of businesses. During 2005, we
sold our interest in the Model AB139 helicopter program to Agusta, our partner
in the BAAC venture. We also purchased US Helicopter to increase Bell’s ability
to provide after-sales service, bought out Kautex’s Japanese joint venture
partner to take advantage of a rapidly growing market, and set up a new joint
venture with a German company, Rothenberger AG, to expand our presence in North
American plumbing tools. In December 2005, our Board of Directors
authorized management’s plan for the divestiture of our Textron Fastening
Systems business. With this approval, we have committed to actively market this
business and anticipate no significant changes to the approved plan and the completion
of the sale within the next twelve months. As a result, this business was
reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2005.

Consolidated Results of Operations

  Revenues – $10.0 Billion

  Segment Profit* – $1.1 Billion

* Segment profit represents the
measurement used by Textron to evaluate performance for decision-making
purposes. Segment profit for manufacturing segments excludes interest expense,
certain corporate expenses, special charges, and gains and losses from the disposition
of significant business units. The measurement for the Finance segment includes
interest income and expense and excludes special charges.

Revenues

Revenues increased $1.7 billion in 2005 primarily due
to higher manufacturing sales volume of $1.3 billion, higher pricing of $159
million, the additional revenue of $115 million from acquisitions and higher
revenue in the Finance segment of $83 million.

Revenues increased $263 million in 2004 primarily due
to favorable foreign exchange of $167 million, the additional revenue of $76
million from the consolidation of CitationShares, higher manufacturing volume
of $31 million and higher pricing of $30 million, partially offset by lower
Finance revenues of $27 million.


Segment Profit

Segment profit increased $296 million in 2005
primarily due to higher sales volume of $319 million, higher pricing of $159
million and higher profit in the Finance segment of $26 million. These increases
were partially offset by inflation of $227 million.

Segment profit increased $145 million in 2004
primarily due to $242 million in cost-reduction initiatives, a $50 million
benefit from restructuring activities and $30 million of higher pricing. These increases
were partially offset by inflation of $167 million.

Special Charges

Special charges are summarized below:

Restructuring Program

Textron substantially completed its company-wide
restructuring program at the end of 2005. Textron approved and committed to a
restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2000 to improve returns at core
businesses and to complete the integration of certain acquisitions. This
program was expanded in 2001 and in 2002 as part of Textron’s strategic effort to
improve operating efficiencies. Textron’s restructuring program included
corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions, consolidation
of facilities, rationalization of certain product lines, outsourcing of
non-core production activity, the divestiture of non-core businesses and the
streamlining of sales and administrative overhead. Under this program, Textron
reduced its workforce by approximately 8,000 employees from continuing
operations, representing approximately 19% of its global workforce since the
program was first announced, and has closed 85 facilities.

As of December 31, 2005, Textron had incurred
total program costs of $306 million, which is composed of $164 million in
severance costs, $44 million in contract termination costs, $34 million in
asset impairment charges (net of gains on the sale of fixed assets) and $64
million in other associated costs. Total program costs incurred by segment
include $219 million in the Industrial segment, $38 million in the Cessna
segment, $29 million in the Bell segment, $9 million in the Finance segment and
$11 million at Corporate.

Other Charges (Gain)

Textron records any charges incurred or gains
realized in connection with the 2001 disposition of the Automotive Trim
business (“Trim”) as Special Charges. In connection with this disposition of
Trim to subsidiaries of Collins & Aikman Corporation (“C&A”),
Textron Finance has recourse to Textron Manufacturing for equipment leases with
the subsidiaries. The outstanding balance on these leases totaled approximately
$70 million at December 31, 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the
lease term for these leases expired and C&A failed to make one of its lease
payments. While Textron Finance is currently in negotiations with C&A to
renew these leases, Textron Manufacturing recorded an additional reserve of $10
million in the fourth quarter of 2005 based on uncertainties related to these
leases.

In addition to the Textron Finance equipment leases,
certain operating leases were transferred and assigned to subsidiaries of
C&A upon the sale of Trim. As discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Textron has guaranteed C&A’s payments under these
operating leases and certain environmental matters. In May 2005, C&A
and substantially all of its U.S. subsidiaries, including C&A Products Co.
(“C&A Products”), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and in July 2005,
C&A’s European subsidiaries filed a group-wide administration order in the
United Kingdom. These filings effectively reduced Textron’s ability to seek
recourse from C&A under the indemnity provisions of the purchase and sale
agreement, should a default occur. Based on C&A’s recent failure to pay
certain leases, as well as the negotiations entered into as part of the
potential sale of C&A’s European operations, Textron recorded $11 million
in the fourth quarter of 2005 to cover its exposure under these leases, along
with certain environmental and workers’ compensation matters.

Textron also acquired preferred stock in C&A Products
and C&A common stock in connection with the Trim disposition. Based on
C&A Products’ filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and relevant
market considerations, Textron recorded charges of approximately $91 million in
2005 to write off the remaining book value of its investment in the preferred
stock. In 2004, Textron sold its remaining investment in the C&A common
stock for cash proceeds of $34 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $12
million.


In 2003, Textron redeemed its 7.92% Junior
Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2045. The debentures were held
by Textron’s wholly owned trust, and the proceeds from their redemption were
used to redeem all of the $500 million Textron Capital I trust preferred
securities. Upon the redemption, $15 million of unamortized issuance costs were
written off and recorded in Special Charges.

Corporate Expenses and Other, Net

Corporate expenses and other, net increased $42
million in 2005, principally due to $16 million for higher compensation and
pension costs, $9 million for corporate initiatives and $7 million for the
corporate portion of share-based compensation expense recorded under a newly
adopted accounting standard.

Corporate expenses and other, net increased $34
million in 2004 primarily due to $14 million of nonrecurring income in 2003, $6
million in higher premiums for Directors and Officers insurance, $5 million in
funding to Textron’s charitable trust and $4 million in higher executive compensation
primarily related to improved operating results. The nonrecurring income in
2003 included $7 million related to an expired royalty agreement and $7 million
in proceeds from life insurance policies.

Income from Continuing Operations

Fluctuations in income from continuing operations are
primarily driven by segment profit changes as discussed above. In addition,
Textron recorded certain items that affected the comparability of operating
results in the last three years which are summarized in the table below:

Gain on sale of businesses includes a gain of $15
million on the sale of Textron’s remaining interest in a previously divested
business.

Share-Based Compensation

During the first quarter of 2005, Textron elected to
adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123
(Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123-R”), using the
modified prospective method. The adoption resulted in recognition of
share-based compensation expense related primarily to the expensing of stock
options in continuing operations of approximately $14 million ($10 million
after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2005, including the net impact
of the cumulative effect of adoption of approximately $1 million in the first
quarter, and $2 million ($1 million after tax) in discontinued operations.

Income Taxes

A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax
rate to the effective income tax rate is provided below:

Discontinued Operations

In December 2005, our Board of Directors
authorized the divestiture of the Textron Fastening Systems business. With this
approval, we have committed to actively market this business and anticipate no
significant changes to the approved plan and the completion of the sale within
the next twelve months.


Discontinued operations include Textron Fastening
Systems and the InteSys, OmniQuip and small business direct businesses as
discontinued operations, net of applicable income taxes, for all periods
presented in accordance with SFAS. No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional discussion of these divestiture activities.

Operating results of the discontinued businesses are
as follows:

In 2005, the loss from discontinued operations
includes a $335 million goodwill impairment charge related to the Textron
Fastening Systems business. In addition, we recorded an after-tax charge of
approximately $52 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, which includes $37
million related to previously deferred foreign currency translation losses and
$2 million of tax charges, both related to the non-U.S.-based business, as well
as $7 million related to curtailment losses for employee retirement plans.
After these charges, management assessed the estimated fair value of the
business and determined that no further adjustment to the carrying value was
required. In addition, approximately $6 million in after-tax deal-related costs
primarily for professional services and advisory fees were incurred during the
fourth quarter. In 2003, the loss from discontinued operations includes a $30
million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge related to the OmniQuip
business.

In 2005, Textron recorded a net $46 million gain on
disposal, primarily related to a tax benefit recorded upon the sale of InteSys.
There was no gain or loss on the sale of OmniQuip and the small business direct
businesses in 2003.

Special charges represent restructuring costs
incurred by Textron Fastening Systems, InteSys and OmniQuip in connection with
the company-wide restructuring program.

Outlook

We expect higher revenues in 2006 as a result of
revenue increases at Bell, Cessna and Finance, while the Industrial businesses
are expected to be down slightly. At Bell, revenues are expected to increase
primarily due to higher commercial helicopter deliveries. At Cessna, we expect
an increase in revenue due to higher sales of jets based on our current
delivery schedule.

Textron’s commercial backlog from unaffiliated
customers was $7.4 billion and $6.3 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and is primarily related to Cessna. U.S. Government backlog was
$3.3 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004, which was substantially all in the
Bell segment. See “Backlog” in Item 1. Business of Textron on page 6 for
more information.

Segment Analysis

Bell


The Bell segment is a supplier of aircraft and weapon
systems providing advanced product and service solutions to both military and
commercial customers. Bell Helicopter is a leading manufacturer of military
helicopters and tiltrotor aircraft for the U.S. Government and commercial
helicopters for corporate, offshore petroleum exploration and development, utility,
charter, police, fire, rescue and emergency medical customers. Textron Systems
is a primary supplier to the defense, aerospace and general aviation markets.

Bell Helicopter participates in several major
programs with the U.S. Government. In association with The Boeing Company, Bell
Helicopter is the only supplier of military tiltrotor aircraft – the V-22. The
U.S. Government has issued contracts for 83 production V-22 aircraft with a
total requirement of 458 aircraft. In September 2005, Bell received
authorization to proceed to full-rate production of the V-22.

Bell Helicopter is nearing completion of the
Engineering and Manufacturing Development (“EMD”) phase of the H-1 Upgrade
Program for the U.S. Marine Corps. This program will produce an advanced attack
and a utility model helicopter, the AH-1Z and UH-1Y, respectively. The
Operational Evaluation for this program is planned to begin shortly after the
delivery of the remaining two aircraft in 2006. The U.S. Government has also
issued contracts for the production of ten UH-1Y aircraft and six AH-1Z
aircraft through Low Rate Initial Production. A contract for an additional lot,
along with a priced option for another lot, is planned to be exercised in the
second quarter of 2006.

Additionally, Bell was awarded a contract for System
Development and Demonstration of the Army’s Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (“ARH”)
with an expected requirement of 368 aircraft. Bell will also participate in the
production of the VH-71 Presidential helicopter fleet through AWB LLC.

During 2005, Bell Helicopter’s commercial business
gained momentum with an increase in orders and deliveries. Bell continued to
invest in commercial programs as evidenced by the significant progress made on
the 429 Global Ranger and other program upgrades in response to customer
requests to improve speed, lower operating costs and reduce noise.

Textron Systems’ principal strategy and focus is to
address the emphasis being placed by the U.S. Department of Defense on network
centric warfare and the leveraging of advances in information technology by
focusing on the development and production of advanced weapon systems.
Additionally, Textron Systems has received orders to deliver more than 1,100
armored security vehicles (“ASV”). Currently, production capacity is ramping up
to meet these deliveries in spite of the disruptions caused by Hurricane
Katrina.

Bell Revenues

U.S. Government Business

U.S. Government revenues increased $491 million in
2005 primarily due to higher revenue of $288 million from the V-22 program,
higher ASV volume of $61 million, the benefit of $36 million from the US
Helicopter acquisition, higher military spares volume of $32 million and
increased sales of $20 million for air-launched weapons. Additionally, Bell
recognized $21 million from the new ARH contract.

U.S. Government revenues decreased $166 million in
2004 largely due to lower revenue of $243 million on the V-22 program primarily
as a result of lower effort on production lots three through six as these
contracts neared completion and a decrease in development activities. Lower
sales of $30 million related to the completion of a contract for training
aircraft in 2003 and an $11 million reduction in revenue, related to a final
agreement with the U.S. Government to settle an overhead cost rate matter, also
contributed to the revenue decrease. These decreases in revenue were partially
offset by $34 million of higher military spares volume, increased sales of $34
million for air-launched weapons and higher H-1 revenue of $34 million.

Commercial Business

Commercial revenues increased $136 million in 2005
primarily due to higher aircraft sales of $68 million, higher spares volume of
$41 million and higher international military sales of $26 million due
primarily to higher ASV deliveries to foreign customers of $58 million that
were partially offset by lower helicopter volume of $32 million.

Commercial revenues increased $72 million in 2004
primarily due to higher international military sales of $64 million, increased
volume in the aircraft engine business of $18 million and higher spares volume
of $14 million. These increases were partially offset by lower Huey II kit
sales of $16 million and lower aircraft sales of $6 million.


Bell Segment Profit

U.S. Government Business

Profit in the U.S. Government business increased $33
million in 2005 principally due to higher V-22 volume of $26 million,
reflecting the delivery of 12 aircraft from Lots 7 and 8, higher volume and improved
performance of air-launched weapons totaling $13 million, and increased ASV
deliveries and improved performance of $10 million. These increases were
partially offset by $18 million of costs associated with Hurricane Katrina.

Profit in the U.S. Government business decreased $31
million in 2004 primarily due to the $20 million impact of lower V-22 revenue,
an $11 million settlement with the U.S. Government and lower volume of training
aircraft of $11 million, partially offset by the $10 million impact of higher
volume of air-launched weapons.

Commercial Business

Commercial profit increased $85 million in 2005
primarily due to the $30 million gain on the sale of our interest in the Model
AB139 helicopter program, the $29 million impact of higher international
military volume and improved performance, higher spares volume of $22 million
and a $13 million impact upon resolution of uncertainties and receipt of cash
related to a prior year collaborative research and development sharing
agreement. In addition, commercial profit reflected a $16 million decrease in
net research and development, as higher gross research and development expenses
of $28 million were more than offset by the commercial share of reimbursements
related to risk-sharing agreements from co-development partners. These
increases were partially offset by $28 million of higher selling and
administrative expense and $18 million in additional reserves recorded by
Lycoming related to the retirement program discussed below and crankshaft
service bulletins discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, Lycoming developed
a plan to institute a retirement program for approximately 5,100 crankshafts,
representing the remaining crankshafts manufactured by the former supplier
using the same forging technique as the crankshafts covered by prior service
bulletins. Accordingly, an additional reserve of $10 million was recorded in
the fourth quarter to cover the expected cost of this planned retirement program.

Commercial profit increased $47 million in 2004
primarily due to the $34 million impact of the higher international military
sales, favorable cost performance in the helicopter business of $31 million
(including the favorable resolution of a $6 million warranty issue provided for
in 2003), the $9 million benefit from a favorable mix of aircraft and the $5
million favorable impact of a nonrecurring 2003 charge related to a recall,
inspection and customer care program at the aircraft engine business, partially
offset by higher engineering expenses of $28 million.

Bell Outlook

Bell’s revenues are expected to increase in 2006,
while margins are expected to drop slightly due to the certain nonrecurring
items that benefited the 2005 results. The U.S. Government business is expected
to benefit from an increase in ASV volume as well as higher revenues from the
ARH and VH-71 program contracts, which is expected to be partially offset by
lower V-22 revenue based on scheduled deliveries. Higher revenue is expected in
our commercial business largely due to increased deliveries in 2005.

Cessna

Cessna Aircraft Company is the world’s largest
manufacturer of general aviation aircraft, based on unit sales. Cessna
currently has four major product lines: Citation business jets, single engine
turboprop Caravans, Cessna single engine piston aircraft and aftermarket
services. Cessna provides dependable aircraft and premier service to corporate
customers in over 75 countries. Cessna also engages in the business jet
fractional ownership market through CitationShares, a venture with TAG Aviation
USA, Inc. During 2005, the economy continued to strengthen, leading to a
significant increase in business jet and single engine aircraft orders. At the
same time, Cessna also realized the benefit of its continued strategy of
investment in new product development receiving FAA certification for the CJ1+
and the CJ2+ in 2005. Cessna also expects to receive certification of the
Mustang in 2006.


Cessna Revenues

The Cessna segment’s revenues increased $1.0 billion
in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to higher Citation business jet
volume of $737 million, higher pricing of $82 million and a benefit from the
consolidation of CitationShares of $78 million. Citation business jet customer
deliveries were 252 in 2005, compared with 179 jets in 2004.

The Cessna segment’s revenues increased $174 million
in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to the $76 million increase from the
consolidation of CitationShares, $39 million of higher pricing and a $12
million benefit from lower to used aircraft overtrade allowances. Citation
business revenue jet deliveries were 179 in 2004, compared with 194 jets in
2003.

Cessna Segment Profit

Segment profit increased $190 million in 2005,
compared with 2004, largely due to the $229 million impact of higher volume
across all product lines and $82 million of higher pricing, partially offset by
$99 million of inflation. Additionally, Cessna was able to significantly
improve profit margins and overcome the challenges associated with ramping up
production and increasing research and development expenses.

Segment profit increased $68 million in 2004,
compared with 2003, largely due to $85 million of improved cost performance,
$39 million of higher pricing, $18 million of lower used aircraft valuation
adjustments, a $12 million benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade
allowances and an $8 million benefit related to the expiration of prior year
residual value guarantees, partially offset by $70 million of inflation and the
unfavorable impact of lower business jet volume and unfavorable mix of $20
million. The benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances and
valuation adjustments was primarily due to fewer trade-ins and a stabilization
in market values for used jets in 2004.

Cessna Outlook

Cessna anticipates another strong year of business
jet deliveries in 2006 with total revenues expected to increase significantly.
Indications are that 2007 will be a strong delivery year as well. In 2006,
profit margins are expected to rise, primarily driven by the increase in
revenue. Cessna will continue to invest in new products such as the Encore+ and
the Mustang, broadening our product line to take advantage of the improving
business jet market.

Industrial

The Industrial segment is composed of five
businesses, including E-Z-GO, Jacobsen, Kautex, Greenlee and Fluid &
Power. Through these businesses, the segment provides its customers with
innovative solutions and services, including golf cars and turf-care equipment,
plastic fuel systems, wire and cable installation equipment, and industrial
pumps and gears. These markets are highly competitive and price sensitive.
Consequently, significant cost reductions are required not only to offset
inflation and price concessions, primarily at Kautex, but also to improve
margins.

Industrial Revenues

The Industrial segment’s revenues increased $8
million in 2005, compared with 2004, as higher pricing of $36 million and
favorable foreign exchange of $31 million were largely offset by lower volume
of $63 million. The lower sales volume primarily reflects decreases of $80
million at Kautex, largely due to product model changeovers, and $39 million at
Jacobsen, primarily related to the strategic realignment of its North American
commercial distribution network. These decreases were partially offset by
higher volume of $31 million at Greenlee.

The Industrial segment’s revenues increased $210
million in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to a favorable foreign
exchange impact of $167 million and higher sales volume of $61 million,
partially offset by $17 million related to the divestiture of a non-core
product line during the second quarter of 2004. The higher sales volume
primarily reflects an increase of $44 million at Kautex, largely due to new
product launches and growth in its international markets, and to a lesser
degree increases of $18 million and $12 million at E-Z-GO and Jacobsen,
respectively.


Industrial Segment Profit

Segment profit decreased $44 million in 2005,
compared with 2004, largely due to inflation of $84 million and the impact of
lower volume and an unfavorable mix of $21 million, partially offset by higher
pricing of $36 million and improved cost performance of $24 million, primarily
at Kautex.

Segment profit increased $44 million in 2004,
compared with 2003, primarily due to $92 million of improved cost performance,
improved credit performance of $16 million, the favorable foreign exchange
impact of $13 million, the $10 million impact of higher volume and lower fair
market value adjustments of $8 million for used golf cars. These increases were
partially offset by inflation of $59 million and lower profit of $24 million at
a North American Kautex plant due to increased costs from manufacturing
inefficiencies.

Industrial Outlook

Industrial revenues are expected to decrease in 2006,
while segment margins are forecasted to improve slightly. The forecasted
decrease in revenues reflects a decline at Kautex, primarily as a result of
model changeovers and the divestiture of a product line in 2005, which is
expected to be partially offset by growth at Greenlee and, to a lesser extent,
increases for the remaining businesses.

Finance

The Finance segment is a diversified commercial
finance business with core operations in aircraft finance, asset-based lending,
distribution finance, golf finance, resort finance and structured capital. Its
financing activities are confined almost exclusively to secured lending and
leasing to commercial markets. Within these core operations, this segment also
provides financing programs for products manufactured by Textron. In 2005,
management continued its focus on growing its core business while liquidating
non-core assets.

Finance Revenues

The Finance segment’s revenues increased $83 million
in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher finance
charges and discounts of $95 million, partially offset by lower prepayment income
of $10 million. The increase in finance charges and discounts was largely due
to a higher interest rate environment, which accounted for $98 million of the
increase, and $62 million related to higher average finance receivables of $855
million, partially offset by lower relative receivable pricing of $65 million.
The increase in average finance receivables was primarily related to growth in
distribution, golf and aircraft finance and asset-based lending, partially
offset by reductions in the liquidating non-core portfolios.

The Finance segment’s revenues decreased $27 million
in 2004, compared with 2003. The decrease was primarily due to lower finance
charges and discounts of $35 million, largely due to the continued liquidation
of non-core assets resulting in lower average finance receivables of $269
million, and a reduction of discount earnings in the distribution finance
business. The decrease was partially offset by higher securitization gains of
$13 million, primarily due to improved yield, and $20 million from an increase
in average finance receivables sold to the distribution finance revolving
conduit, partially offset by a $6 million reduction in resort finance gains.

Finance Segment Profit

Segment profit increased $32 million in 2005,
compared with 2004, primarily due to a $29 million decrease in the provision
for loan losses as a result of sustained improvements in portfolio quality, and
an $18 million increase in net interest margin, which was partially offset by
higher selling and administrative expenses of $15 million. The increase in net
interest margin was primarily attributable to portfolio growth. Selling and
administrative expenses increased primarily due to $9 million in higher
variable compensation associated with portfolio growth and $5 million related
to improved profitability and increased pension and benefits cost.

Segment profit increased $17 million in 2004,
compared with 2003, primarily due to a $23 million decrease in the provision
for loan losses, reflecting an improvement in portfolio quality, partially
offset by lower net interest margin of $10 million.


Finance Portfolio Quality

The following table presents information about the
credit quality of the Finance segment’s portfolio:

The Finance segment has experienced significant
improvements in portfolio quality over the past two years. The improvements in
credit quality were evident through lower nonperforming asset levels and 60+
days contractual delinquency.

Textron Finance’s nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual accounts that are not guaranteed by Textron Manufacturing, for which
interest has been suspended, and repossessed assets. Nonperforming assets for
each of the last three year-ends by business are as follows:

We believe that nonperforming assets will generally
be in the range of 1% to 4% of finance assets depending on economic conditions.
Textron Finance experienced significant improvement in total nonperforming
assets with a $29 million decrease in 2005 and a $22 million decrease in 2004.
The decrease in 2005 was primarily attributable to core businesses, including
$22 million in resort finance and $13 million in golf finance, largely related
to improved general economic conditions. These decreases were partially offset
by an increase in liquidating portfolios. These non-core businesses continue to
compose a disproportionate amount of Textron Finance’s nonperforming assets
accounting for 41% of total nonperforming assets while comprising less than 5%
of the total finance assets at December 31, 2005.

Finance Outlook

In 2006, we expect the Finance segment’s profit to
increase primarily as a result of improved net interest margin related to higher
average finance receivables.


Special Charges by Segment

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Textron’s financings are conducted through two
borrowing groups: Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance. This framework is
designed to enhance Textron’s borrowing power by separating the Finance
segment. To support creditors in evaluating the separate borrowing groups,
Textron presents separate balance sheets and statements of cash flows for each
borrowing group. Textron Manufacturing consists of Textron Inc., the parent
company, consolidated with the entities that operate in the Bell, Cessna and
Industrial business segments, whose financial results are a reflection of the
ability to manage and finance the development, production and delivery of
tangible goods and services. Textron Finance consists of Textron’s wholly owned
commercial finance subsidiary, Textron Financial Corporation, consolidated with
its subsidiaries. The financial results of Textron Finance are a reflection of
its ability to provide financial services in a competitive marketplace, at
appropriate pricing, while managing the associated financial risks. The
fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities result in
different measures used by investors, rating agencies and analysts.

A portion of Textron Finance’s business involves
financing retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment
manufactured by Textron Manufacturing. The cash flows related to these captive
financing activities are reflected as operating activities (by Textron
Manufacturing) and as investing activities (by Textron Finance) based on each
group’s operations. These captive financing transactions have been eliminated,
and cash from customers or from securitizations is recognized in operating
activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows when received.

Textron Inc. provides a support agreement to Textron
Finance that requires Textron Inc. to maintain 100% ownership of Textron
Finance. The agreement also requires Textron Finance to maintain fixed charge
coverage of no less than 125% and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less
than $200 million. Textron Finance’s bank agreements prohibit the termination
of the support agreement.

Textron’s financial position continued to be strong
at the end of 2005 and included aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $796
million, compared with $697 million at the end of 2004. During 2005, cash flows
from operations were the primary source of funds for our operating needs,
dividends and capital expenditures. Management analyzes operating cash flows
for Textron Manufacturing by tracking free cash flow, which is calculated using
net cash provided by operating activities, adding back proceeds on the sale of
property, plant and equipment, then subtracting capital expenditures, including
those financed with capital leases.


Operating Cash Flows of Continuing
Operations

Operating cash flows on a consolidated basis have
remained fairly consistent over the past few years. These consolidated cash
flows exclude net captive financing activity (cash outflows from finance
receivable originations, net of cash inflows from repayments, sales and
securitizations) between Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance. In 2005 and
2004, this net captive financing activity increased Textron Manufacturing’s
separate cash flows by $100 million and $165 million, respectively, while in
2003, cash flows were decreased by $86 million. Excluding these net changes
from Textron Manufacturing’s cash flows, the increase in 2005 is largely due to
increased income from operations, while the increase in 2004 is largely due to
increased customer deposits in the Bell and Cessna segments resulting from an
increase in orders for jets and commercial helicopters.

Textron Manufacturing’s operating cash flows include
after-tax cash used to fund Textron’s restructuring program of $12 million in
2005, $24 million in 2004 and $34 million in 2003. This program was
substantially completed at the end of 2005 with forecasted cash payments in
2006 of approximately $4 million.

Investing Cash Flows of Continuing
Operations

Over the past three years, Textron’s consolidated
cash flows used in investing activities have been largely driven by an increase
in net financing activities at Textron Finance. The 2005 and 2004 increases in
cash used in investing activities in the consolidated cash flows reflect a
higher use of cash resulting from the increase in finance receivable
originations, net of cash collections from repayments, sales and
securitizations, of $198 million and $744 million, respectively.

Textron Manufacturing increased its use of cash for
investing activities by $204 million in 2005 primarily with a $118 million
increase in capital expenditures and a $38 million decrease in proceeds that
were received in 2004 from the sale of C&A common stock. The increase in
capital expenditures is primarily related to higher spending at the Bell
segment in response to increased production demands. Capital expenditures for
Textron Manufacturing totaled $371 million in 2005, $282 million in 2004 and
$272 million in 2003, including expenditures purchased through capital leases
of $15 million in 2005, $44 million in 2004 and $26 million in 2003.

The separate borrowing group cash flows of Textron
Finance reflect investing activities that include $824 million, $892 million
and $886 million in non-cash activity for finance receivables originated in
connection with the sale of Textron Manufacturing’s inventory in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. Cash received from customers and securitizations related to
the sale of this inventory is also included within Textron Finance’s investing
activities totaling $724 million, $727 million and $972 million in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. Within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows these
amounts have been eliminated from investing activities and are recorded as a
net amount in operating cash flows under the caption “Captive Finance
Receivables, Net.”

Financing Cash Flows of Continuing
Operations

The 2005 increase in cash provided by financing
activities in the consolidated cash flows was largely due to an increase in
debt outstanding at both Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance. The
increase in Textron Manufacturing principally reflects a retirement of debt of
$300 million in 2004 and the issuance of $281 million in short term debt in
2005. Textron Finance increased its debt outstanding to fund asset growth.
These


increases were partially offset by higher cash
outflows from a $182 million increase in purchases of Textron common stock, $81
million in lower proceeds from employee stock ownership plans and a $54 million
increase in dividend payments, primarily due to the timing of dividend payments
with four quarters paid in 2005 and only three quarters paid in 2004.

In 2004, the decrease in cash used by financing
activities in the consolidated cash flows principally reflects a $715 million
increase in cash provided by Textron Finance reflecting an increase in debt
outstanding to fund asset growth, partially offset by a decrease at Textron
Manufacturing largely due to higher cash outflows from a $351 million increase
in purchases of Textron common stock.

Principal Payments and Retirements
of Long-Term Debt

In 2005, 2004 and 2003, Textron Manufacturing made
principal payments of $417 million, $360 million and $503 million,
respectively. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, Textron Finance made principal payments
on long-term debt of $0.8 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

Stock Repurchases

On January 26, 2006, Textron’s Board of
Directors authorized a new 12-million-share repurchase program. This program
supercedes Textron’s previous authorization, which was exhausted in January. In
2005, 2004 and 2003, Textron repurchased approximately 8,035,000, 6,534,000 and
1,951,000 shares of common stock, respectively, under its Board-authorized
share repurchase programs for an aggregate cost of $606 million, $425 million
and $66 million, respectively.

Dividends

Textron’s Board of Directors approved dividends of
$1.40 per common share in 2005. On January 26, 2006, the Board of
Directors authorized a $0.15 per share increase in Textron’s annualized common
stock dividend to $1.55 per share and, accordingly, a quarterly dividend of
$0.3875 per share for holders of record at the close of business on March 10,
2006. Dividend payments to shareholders totaled $189 million, $135 million and
$222 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2003 payments include an
additional payment made for the fourth quarter dividend, which is typically
paid in the following year.

Discontinued Operations Cash Flows

Cash flows from discontinued operations include
Textron Manufacturing’s Fastening Systems, OmniQuip and InteSys businesses, and
Textron Finance’s small business finance operation. See Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for details concerning these dispositions. In
2003, cash provided by investing activities included the receipt of $421
million in cash upon the sale of substantially all of the small business
finance operation, and $198 million in tax refunds and cash proceeds related to
the sale of the OmniQuip business, partially offset by $197 million in finance
receivable originations, net of repayments.

Capital Resources

Textron Manufacturing’s debt (net of cash)-to-capital
ratio as of December 31, 2005 was 26%, compared with 25% at January 1,
2005. Textron Manufacturing’s gross debt-to-capital ratio as of December 31,
2005 was 37%, compared with 33% at January 1, 2005. Textron Manufacturing
has established a gross debt-to-capital ratio target in the mid-thirties.
Consistent with the methodology used by members of the financial community,
leverage of the manufacturing operations excludes the debt of Textron Finance.
In turn, Textron Finance limits its borrowings to an amount, taking into
account the risk profile of its assets, consistent with a single A credit
rating. Surplus capital of Textron Finance is returned to Textron Inc.

Borrowings have historically been a secondary source
of funds for Textron Manufacturing and, along with the collection of finance
receivables, are a primary source of funds for Textron Finance. Both Textron
Manufacturing and Textron Finance utilize a broad base of financial sources for
their respective liquidity and capital needs. Our credit ratings are
predominantly a function of our ability to generate operating cash flow and
satisfy certain financial ratios. Since high-quality credit ratings provide us
with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost, we
target a long-term A rating from the independent debt-rating agencies. In November 2005,
Fitch upgraded its outlook for Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance to
positive, while Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s have assessed the
outlook for both groups as stable. The credit ratings of these three
debt-ratings agencies are as follows:


For liquidity purposes, Textron Manufacturing and
Textron Finance have a policy of maintaining sufficient unused lines of credit
to support their outstanding commercial paper. None of these lines of credit
was used at December 31, 2005 or January 1, 2005. Textron
Manufacturing has primary revolving credit facilities of $1.3 billion that
expire in 2010. Textron Manufacturing’s credit facilities permit Textron
Finance to borrow under those facilities. Textron Finance also has $1.5 billion
in bank lines of credit, of which $500 million expires in July 2006 and
$1.0 billion expires in 2010. Textron Finance’s facility that expires in 2006
includes a one-year term out option that effectively extends its expiration
into 2007. At December 31, 2005, the lines of credit not reserved as
support for commercial paper and letters of credit were $1.2 billion for
Textron Manufacturing and $300 million for Textron Finance.

Under a shelf registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Textron Finance may issue public debt
securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of $4.0
billion. Under this registration statement, Textron Finance issued $1.4 billion
of term debt and CAD 0.1 billion of term debt during 2005. The proceeds from
these issuances were used to fund receivable growth and repay short-term debt.
At December 31, 2005, Textron Finance had $1.8 billion available under
this registration statement. Textron Manufacturing may issue public debt and
other securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of
$2.0 billion under its shelf registration statement filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. At December 31, 2005, Textron Manufacturing had
$1.6 billion available under this registration statement.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes Textron Manufacturing’s
known contractual obligations to make future payments or other consideration
pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2005, as well as an
estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied:

Long-term debt and capital lease obligations included
in the table above do not include interest payments. Operating leases represent
undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases.

Textron maintains defined benefit pension plans and
postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in the table above are discounted
estimated benefit payments to be made by Textron related to unfunded pension
and other postretirement benefit plans. Actual benefit payments are dependent
on a number of factors, including mortality assumptions, expected retirement
age, rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates, which are subject
to change in future years. Textron also expects to make contributions to its
funded pension plans in the range of $25 million to $30 million per year over
the next five years, which are not reflected in this table.


Other Long-Term Liabilities primarily include
undiscounted amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,
2005 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and
estimated environmental remediation costs. Payments under deferred compensation
arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected
retirement age, mortality, stock price and rates of return on participant
deferrals. Timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs
are largely based on historical experience.

Purchase obligations represent undiscounted
obligations for which Textron is committed to purchase goods and services as of
December 31, 2005. Textron’s ultimate liability for these obligations may
be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase
contracts, the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by
recourse under firm contracts with the U.S. Government under normal termination
clauses.

Effective January 2, 2005, Textron engaged a
third-party service provider to assume oversight of its information technology
infrastructure, including maintenance, operational oversight and purchases of
hardware (the “IT Contract”). The IT Contract covers a 10-year period and is
subject to variable pricing and quantity provisions for both purchases of
computer hardware and system design modifications. Textron retains the right to
approve significant design, equipment purchase and related decisions by the
service provider. Textron has the ability to terminate the IT Contract prior to
its full term and would consequently be subject to variable termination fees
that decline over time and do not exceed $63 million in 2006.

In addition to the amounts included above, Textron
Manufacturing has contractual obligations related to certain businesses
reported as discontinued operations, primarily related to purchase obligations
and post-retirement benefit obligations other than pensions. These amounts are
estimated to be paid as follows: $54 million in less than one year, $11 million
in two years, $1 million in three years, $1 million in four years, $1 million
in five years and $27 million in more than five years.

The following table summarizes Textron Finance’s
known contractual obligations to make future payments. Due to the nature of
finance companies, Textron Finance also has contractual cash receipts that will
be received in the future. Textron Finance generally borrows funds at various
contractual maturities to match the maturities of its finance receivables. The
contractual payments and receipts as of December 31, 2005 are detailed
below:

Finance receivable receipts are based on contractual
cash flows. These amounts could differ due to prepayments, charge-offs and
other factors. Contractual receipts and payments exclude finance charges and
discounts from receivables, debt interest payments, proceeds from sale of
operating lease equipment and other items.

As shown in the preceding table, cash collections
from finance assets are expected to be sufficient to cover maturing debt and
other contractual liabilities. At December 31, 2005, Textron Finance had
$2.2 billion in debt and $439 million in Other Liabilities that are payable
within the next 12 months.


At December 31, 2005, Textron Finance had unused
commitments to fund new and existing customers under $1.2 billion of committed
revolving lines of credit, compared with $1.0 billion at January 1, 2005.
Since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will
expire unused, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent
future cash requirements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Textron has joint venture agreements with external
financing arrangements for which Textron has guaranteed approximately $15
million in debt obligations, including approximately $5 million related to
discontinued operations. Textron would be required to make payments under these
guarantees if a joint venture defaults under the debt agreements.

Bell Helicopter and AgustaWestland North America Inc.
(“AWNA”) formed the AgustaWestlandBell LLC (“AWB LLC”) in January 2004 for
the joint design, development, manufacture, sale, customer training and product
support of the US101 helicopter, recently designated the VH-71 helicopter, and
certain variations and derivatives thereof, to be offered and sold to
departments or agencies of the U.S. Government.

In March 2005, AWB LLC received a $1.2 billion
cost reimbursement-type subcontract from Lockheed Martin for the System
Development and Demonstration phase of the U.S. Marine Corps Marine 1
Helicopter Squadron (VH-71) Program. On March 11, 2005, Bell Helicopter
guaranteed to Lockheed Martin the due and prompt performance by AWB LLC of all
its obligations under this subcontract, provided that Bell Helicopter’s
liability under the guaranty shall not exceed 49% of AWB LLC’s aggregate
liability to Lockheed Martin under the subcontract. AgustaWestland N.V., AWNA’s
parent company, has guaranteed the remaining 51% to Lockheed Martin. Bell
Helicopter and AgustaWestland N.V. have entered into cross-indemnification
agreements in which each party indemnifies the other related to any payments required
under these agreements that result from the indemnifying party’s workshare
under any subcontracts received.

For 2005, AWB LLC’s maximum obligation is 20% of the
total contract value, which equates to $232 million based on the current
contract value of $1.2 billion. In 2006, AWB LLC’s maximum obligation increases
to 40%, or $464 million, and thereafter increases to 50%, or $580 million.
Accordingly, the maximum amount of Bell Helicopter’s liability under the
guarantee is $114 million at December 31, 2005 and will be $227 million in
2006 and $284 million thereafter through completion.

Textron Manufacturing enters into a forward contract
in Textron common stock on an annual basis. The contract is intended to hedge
the earnings and cash volatility of stock-based incentive compensation indexed
to Textron stock. The forward contract requires annual cash settlement between
the counterparties based upon a number of shares multiplied by the difference
between the strike price and the prevailing Textron common stock price. As of December 31,
2005, the contract was for approximately 1.7 million shares with a strike price
of $70.80. The market price of the stock was $76.98 at December 31, 2005,
resulting in a receivable of $10 million, compared with a receivable of $31
million at January 1, 2005.

Textron Finance sells finance receivables utilizing
both securitizations and whole-loan sales. As a result of these transactions,
finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet, and the proceeds
received are used to reduce the recorded debt levels. Despite the reduction in
the recorded balance sheet position, Textron Finance generally retains a
subordinate interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations,
which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments.
These retained interests are more fully discussed in the Securitizations section of
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Textron Finance utilizes these
off-balance sheet financing arrangements (primarily asset-backed
securitizations) to further diversify funding alternatives. These arrangements
are an important source of funding that provided net proceeds from continuing
operations of $361 million and $394 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Proceeds from securitizations includes proceeds received related to incremental
increases in the level of distribution finance receivables sold and excludes
amounts received related to the ongoing replenishment of the outstanding sold
balance of these receivables with short durations. Textron Finance has used the
proceeds from these arrangements to fund the origination of new finance
receivables and to retire commercial paper.

Whole-loan finance receivable sales in which Textron
Finance maintains a continuing interest differ from securitizations as loans
are sold directly to investors and no portion of the sale proceeds is deferred.
Limited credit enhancement is typically provided for these transactions in the
form of a contingent liability related to finance receivable credit losses and,
to a lesser extent, prepayment risk. Textron Finance has a contingent liability
related to the sale of equipment lease rents in 2003 and 2001. The maximum
liability at December 31, 2005 was $42 million. Textron Finance has valued
this contingent liability based on assumptions for annual credit losses and
prepayment rates of 0.25% and 7.50%, respectively. An instantaneous 20% adverse
change in these rates would have an insignificant impact on the valuation of
this recourse liability.

Termination of Textron Finance’s off-balance sheet
financing arrangements would significantly reduce its short-term funding
alternatives. While these arrangements do not contain provisions that require
Textron Finance to repurchase significant balances of receivables previously
sold, there are risks that could reduce the availability of these funding
alternatives in the future. Potential barriers to the continued use of these
arrangements


include deterioration in finance receivable portfolio
quality, downgrades in Textron Finance’s debt credit ratings and a reduction of
new finance receivable originations in the businesses that utilize these
funding arrangements. Textron Finance does not expect any of these factors to
have a material impact on its liquidity or income from continuing operations.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our Consolidated Financial
Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and
application of accounting policies. The accounting policies that we believe are
most critical to the portrayal of Textron’s financial condition and results of
operations are listed below. We believe these policies require our most
difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of
inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which includes other significant
accounting policies.

Receivable and Inventory Reserves

We evaluate the collectibility of our commercial and
finance receivables based on a combination of factors. For larger balance
commercial loans, Textron Finance considers borrower specific information,
industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows, as well as the factors
reviewed for its homogeneous loan pools. In circumstances where we are aware of
a specific customer’s inability to meet its short-term financial obligations to
us (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit scores,
geographic economic conditions, etc.), we record a specific reserve for bad
debts for amounts we estimate to be potentially uncollectible. Receivables are
charged off when deemed uncollectible.

For homogeneous loan pools and all other receivables,
we recognize reserves for bad debts based on current delinquencies, the
characteristics of the existing accounts, historical loss experience, the value
of underlying collateral, and general economic conditions and trends. Textron
Finance estimates that its losses will range from 0.5% to 4.0% of finance
receivables depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool. Finance
receivables are written down to the fair value (less estimated costs to sell)
of the related collateral at the earlier of the date when the collateral is
repossessed or when no payment has been received for six months unless we deem
the receivable collectible.

Reserves on certain finance receivables are
determined using estimates of related collateral values based on historical
recovery rates and current market conditions. Management reviews the market
conditions for used equipment and aircraft inventories on a periodic basis. A
deterioration in market conditions resulting in lower recovery rates would
result in lower estimated collateral values, increasing the amount of reserves
required on related receivables and used inventories on hand. Based on current
market conditions and recovery rates, we believe our reserves are adequate as
of December 31, 2005.

Long-Term Contracts

We recognize revenue and profit as work on certain
government long-term engineering, development and production contracts
progresses using the contract method of accounting, which relies on estimates
of the total contract cost and revenue. Estimated contract cost and revenue are
based on current contract specifications, expected engineering requirements and
the achievement of contract milestones, including product deliveries. Contract
costs are typically incurred over a period of several years, and the estimation
of these costs requires substantial judgment. The cost estimation process is
based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program
managers along with finance professionals. We update our projections of costs
at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change. Adjustments
to projected costs are recognized in net earnings when determinable. Favorable
changes in estimates result in additional profit recognition, while unfavorable
changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized earnings.
Any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified.
Earnings on long-term contracts could be reduced by a material amount resulting
in a charge to income if (a) total estimated contract costs are
significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications
prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are
significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or
inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during
the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet
contract milestones.

Goodwill

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually
in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances,
such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes
in the business climate, indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be
impaired. We completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2005
using the estimates from our long-term strategic plans. No adjustment was
required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed.

Goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net
book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair values
are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using
assumptions consistent with market participants. The determination of
discounted cash flows is based on the businesses’ strategic plans and
long-range planning forecasts. The revenue growth rates included in the plans
are management’s


best estimates based on current and forecasted market
conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting
unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions.
If different assumptions were used in these plans, the related undiscounted
cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different, potentially
resulting in an impairment charge.

Within our Industrial segment, the Fluid Handling
Products component has assumed an annual operating profit growth rate of
approximately 9% over the five-year planning period driven by anticipated
revenue growth of approximately 4% annually along with increased profit margins
from improvements resulting from ongoing transformation efforts. A 100-basis-point
reduction in the estimated operating profit growth rate from those used in our
discounted cash flow model to approximately 8% would reduce the estimated fair
value by up to approximately $20 million, and may result in the carrying value
of the business exceeding its estimated fair value, potentially resulting in an
impairment charge. At December 31, 2005, the goodwill allocated to this
business totaled approximately $200 million.

Securitized Transactions

Securitized transactions involve the sale of finance
receivables to qualified special purpose trusts. While the assets sold are no
longer on our balance sheet, our retained interests are included in Other
Assets. We may retain an interest in the transferred assets in the form of
interest-only securities, seller certificates, cash reserve accounts, and
servicing rights and obligations. Our retained interests are subordinate to
other investors’ interests in the securitizations. Generally, we do not provide
legal recourse to third-party investors that purchase interests in our
securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained interest
only securities, seller certificates and cash reserve accounts.

We estimate the fair value of the retained interests
based on the present value of future cash flows expected using our best
estimates of prepayment speeds, credit losses and discount rates commensurate
with the risks involved. These assumptions are reviewed each quarter, and the
retained interests are written down when the carrying value exceeds the fair
value based on revised estimates and the decline is estimated to be other than
temporary. Based on our sensitivity analysis, as discussed in Note 5 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, a 20% adverse change in either the
prepayment speed, expected credit losses or the residual cash flows discount
rate would not result in a material charge to income.

Pension and Other Postretirement
Benefits

We maintain various pension and postretirement plans
for our employees globally. These plans include significant pension and
postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial
valuations. Key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related
expenses include expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount
rates and healthcare cost projections. These assumptions are evaluated and
updated annually by management in consultation with outside actuaries and
investment advisors. Other assumptions used include employee demographic
factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and the rate of
compensation increases.

To determine the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as
historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate
of return on plan assets will increase pension expense. For 2005, we have
reduced the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in
calculating pension expense to 8.57% from 8.72% in 2004. While over the past
ten years, returns for the largest pool of managed retirement assets have
exceeded 9.97%, the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return
assumption was lowered to reflect the generally expected moderation of
long-term rates of return in the financial markets, as well as the change in
our investment portfolio mix. Our qualified domestic plans compose over 83% of our
total pension obligations. In 2005, the assumed rate of return for our
qualified domestic plans was 8.75%. A 50-basis-point decrease in this long-term
rate of return would result in a $21 million annual increase in pension expense
for our qualified domestic plans.

The discount rate enables us to state expected future
benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the
current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled.
This rate should be in line with rates for high-quality fixed income
investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, which
fluctuate as long-term interest rates change. A lower discount rate increases
the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense. In
2005, we decreased our weighted-average discount rate used in calculating
pension expense to 5.69% from 6.17% in 2004. For our qualified domestic plans,
the assumed discount rate was 5.75% for 2005. A 50-basis-point decrease in this
discount rate would result in a $32 million annual increase in pension expense
for our qualified domestic plans.

The estimated accumulated benefit obligations for
certain pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets at December 31,
2005. However, strong asset returns and contributions to the plans reduced the
shortfall during 2005. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash adjustment to
shareholders’ equity for the minimum pension liability of $34 million, net of
income taxes, in the fourth quarter of 2005.

The trend in healthcare costs is difficult to
estimate, and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities. The
2005 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rate, which is the
weighted-average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of
covered benefits, was 11%. The medical rate is assumed to decrease to 5% by
2009 and then remain at that level. The prescription drug rate is expected to
rise to 12%


in 2006, then decrease to 5% by 2013 and then remain
at that level. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the
impact of a one-percentage-point change in the cost trend rate.

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for
the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the
evaluation of available evidence, we recognized future tax benefits, such as
net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that we believe it is more
likely than not that we will realize these benefits. We periodically assess the
likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect
any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding
adjustment to earnings or Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), as appropriate.

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we
look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable
income in prior carryback years, the feasibility of tax planning strategies and
estimated future taxable income. The valuation allowance can be affected by
changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future
taxable income estimates. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for further detail.

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to
ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result
in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any
uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately
provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters.
However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to
our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations, new
regulatory or judicial pronouncements, or other relevant events. As a result,
our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis.

Recently Adopted Accounting
Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
(“SFAS No. 123-R”), which replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” and supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. SFAS No. 123-R requires
companies to measure compensation costs for share-based payments to employees,
including stock options, at fair value and expense such compensation over the
service period beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15,
2005. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed the
transition date for companies to the first fiscal year beginning after June 15,
2005, effectively delaying Textron’s required adoption of SFAS No. 123-R
until the first quarter of 2006.

Textron elected to adopt SFAS No. 123-R in the
first quarter of 2005 using the modified prospective method. Under this
transition method, compensation expense recognized in 2005 includes: a)
compensation cost for all stock options and restricted stock granted prior to
but not yet vested as of January 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair
value estimated and recognized in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123
and b) compensation cost for all stock options and restricted stock granted
subsequent to January 1, 2005, and all share-based compensation awards
accounted for as liabilities, based upon the measurement and recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123-R. For awards granted or modified in 2005 and
prospectively, compensation costs for awards with only service conditions that
vest ratably are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period for each separately vesting portion of the award. Compensation costs for
awards granted prior to 2005 are recognized using the attribution methods
required under SFAS No. 123. Upon adoption, Textron re-measured its
share-based compensation awards that are accounted for as liabilities at fair
value. The cumulative effect of adoption upon this re-measurement resulted in
an increase to net income of approximately $1 million in the first quarter of
2005, which is not considered to be material and is recorded in selling and
administrative expense.

Adoption of SFAS No. 123-R resulted in
recognition of stock option costs in 2005. The stock option costs are included
primarily in selling and administrative expense and totaled approximately $15
million for continuing operations and $2 million for discontinued operations in
2005. In accordance with the modified prospective method, prior periods have
not been restated. No compensation expense related to stock option grants has
been recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2003 and 2004, as
all of the options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of
the underlying stock on the date of grant.

As of December 31, 2005, $58 million represents
the total compensation cost associated with unvested share-based compensation
awards subject only to service conditions that has not yet been recognized.
Textron expects that this compensation will be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately two years. As of December 31,
2005, $25 million represents the total compensation cost associated with
unvested share-based compensation awards subject to performance vesting
conditions that has not yet been recognized. Textron expects that this
compensation will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
two years.


SFAS No. 123-R requires that the excess tax
benefits received related to stock option exercises be presented as financing
cash inflows. For 2005, $14 million of these excess tax benefits have been presented
as cash provided by financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows.

The valuation of stock options requires numerous
assumptions. Textron determines the fair value of each option as of the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires inputs
for the expected volatility of Textron’s common stock price, expected life of
the option and expected dividend yield, among others. In addition, we estimate
the number of options expected to eventually vest. Expected volatility
estimates are based on implied volatilities from traded options on Textron
common stock, historical volatilities and other factors. Textron uses
historical data to estimate option exercise behavior, adjusted to reflect
anticipated increases in expected life.

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional details.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risks

Our financial results are affected by changes in U.S.
and foreign interest rates. As part of managing this risk, we enter into
interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floating-rate debt to
fixed-rate debt and vice versa. The overall objective of our interest rate risk
management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating- and fixed-rate
debt. We continuously monitor our mix of floating- and fixed-rate debt and
adjust the mix, as necessary, based on our evaluation of internal and external
factors. The difference between the rates Textron Manufacturing received and
the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly
impact interest expense in 2005, 2004 or 2003.

Within the Finance segment, a strategy of matching
floating-rate assets with floating-rate liabilities limits our risk to changes
in interest rates. This strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange
agreements. At December 31, 2005, floating-rate liabilities in excess of
floating-rate assets were $156 million, net of $2.9 billion of interest rate
exchange agreements which effectively converted fixed-rate debt to a
floating-rate equivalent and $122 million of interest rate exchange agreements
which effectively converted fixed-rate finance receivables to a floating-rate
equivalent. For Textron Finance, interest rate exchange agreements designated
as hedges of debt had the effect of decreasing interest expense by $11 million,
$40 million and $43 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Foreign Exchange Risks

Our financial results are affected by changes in
foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets
in which products are manufactured and/or sold. For 2005, the impact of foreign
exchange rate changes from 2004 increased revenues by approximately $31 million
(0.4%) and decreased segment profit by approximately $3 million (0.4%).

Textron Manufacturing manages its exposures to
foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign
currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that
certain exposures are naturally offset. During 2005, Textron Manufacturing
primarily used borrowings denominated in euro and British pound sterling for
these purposes.

In managing its foreign currency transaction
exposures, Textron Manufacturing also enters into foreign currency forward
exchange and option contracts. These contracts are generally used to fix the
local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The notional
amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency options and
currency swaps was approximately $699 million at the end of 2005 and $493
million at the end of 2004.

Quantitative Risk Measures

In the normal course of business, we enter into
financial instruments for purposes other than trading. To quantify the market
risk inherent in our financial instruments, we utilize a sensitivity analysis.
The financial instruments that are subject to market risk (interest rate risk,
foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk) include finance receivables
(excluding lease receivables), debt (excluding lease obligations), interest
rate exchange agreements, foreign exchange contracts, marketable equity
securities and marketable security price forward contracts.

Presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair
value of financial instruments outstanding at year-end. We estimate the fair
value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and
independent investment bankers. This sensitivity analysis is most likely not
indicative of actual results in the future. The following table illustrates the
sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial
instruments assuming a 10% decrease in interest rates, a 10% strengthening in exchange
rates against the U.S. dollar and a 10% decrease in the quoted market prices of
applicable marketable equity securities.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report
of Management

Management is responsible for the integrity and
objectivity of the financial data presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include
amounts based on management’s best estimates and judgments. Management is also
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting for Textron Inc., as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).
With the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation
under the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, we have
concluded that Textron Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.

The independent registered public accounting firm,
Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements
of Textron Inc. and has issued an attestation report on our assessment of the
effectiveness of Textron’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, as stated in its reports, which are included herein.

We conduct our business in accordance with the
standards outlined in the Textron Business Conduct Guidelines, which is communicated
to all employees. Honesty, integrity and high ethical standards are the core
values of how we conduct business. Every Textron business prepares and carries
out an annual Compliance Plan to ensure these values and standards are
maintained. Our internal control structure is designed to provide reasonable
assurance, at appropriate cost, that assets are safeguarded and that
transactions are properly executed and recorded. The internal control structure
includes, among other things, established policies and procedures, an internal
audit function, and the selection and training of qualified personnel. Textron’s
management is responsible for implementing effective internal control systems
and monitoring their effectiveness, as well as developing and executing an
annual internal control plan.

The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, on
behalf of the shareholders, oversees management’s financial reporting
responsibilities. The Audit Committee, composed of five directors who are not
officers or employees of Textron, meets regularly with the independent
auditors, management and our internal auditors to review matters relating to
financial reporting, internal accounting controls and auditing. Both the
independent auditors and the internal auditors have free and full access to
senior management and the Audit Committee.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Textron Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Report of Management, that Textron Inc. (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the “COSO criteria”). Textron’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Textron
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
Also, in our opinion, Textron Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Textron Inc. as of December 31, 2005 and January 1,
2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
changes in shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005 of Textron Inc. and our report dated February 13,
2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedule

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Textron Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Textron Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and January 1,
2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
changes in shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule contained
on page 77. These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Textron Inc. at December 31, 2005 and January 1,
2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Textron Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2006 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

As discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, in 2005 Textron adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”, and as discussed in
Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2003 Textron adopted SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both
Liabilities and Equity.”

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Textron Inc. (“Textron”) is a global, multi-industry
company with manufacturing and finance operations primarily in North America
and Europe. Textron’s principal markets are summarized below by segment:

Principles of Consolidation and
Financial Statement Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of Textron Inc. and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries (more than
50%) along with variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities-Revised” (“FIN 46-R”).
FIN 46-R requires the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an
enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a
majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of
ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. Variable
interest entities are defined as entities with a level of invested equity
insufficient to fund future activities to operate on a standalone basis, or
whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial
interest. If an entity does not meet the definition of a variable interest
entity under FIN 46-R, Textron accounts for the entity under the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of
Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” which requires the consolidation
of all majority-owned subsidiaries where the company has the ability to
exercise control.

Textron’s financings are conducted through two
borrowing groups: Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance. This framework is
designed to enhance Textron’s borrowing power by separating the Finance
segment. To support creditors in evaluating the separate borrowing groups,
Textron presents separate balance sheets and statements of cash flows for each
borrowing group. Textron Manufacturing consists of Textron Inc., the parent
company, consolidated with the entities that operate in the Bell, Cessna and
Industrial business segments. Textron Manufacturing’s cash flows include
dividends received from Textron Finance but exclude its pre-tax income. Textron
Finance consists of Textron’s wholly owned commercial finance subsidiary,
Textron Financial Corporation, consolidated with its subsidiaries, which are
the entities through which Textron operates its Finance segment. Textron
Finance obtains financing for its operations by borrowing from its own group of
external creditors.

A portion of Textron Finance’s business involves
financing retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment
manufactured by Textron Manufacturing. The cash flows related to these captive
financing activities are reflected as operating activities (by Textron
Manufacturing) and as investing activities (by Textron Finance) based on each
group’s operations. For example, when product is sold to a customer and
financed by Textron Finance, Textron Finance records the origination of the
finance receivable within investing activities as a cash outflow. Textron
Manufacturing records the cash received from Textron Finance on the customer’s
behalf within operating activities. Although cash is transferred between the
businesses, there is no cash transaction for the consolidated group at the time
of the original financing. These captive financing activities, along with all
significant intercompany transactions, are eliminated from the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In 2005, Textron has separately disclosed the
operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows attributable to
its discontinued operations, which in prior periods were reported on a combined
basis as a single amount.  Prior periods
have been revised to conform to this presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these statements
and accompanying notes. Some of the more significant estimates include
inventory


valuation, residual values of
leased assets, allowance for credit losses on receivables, product liability,
workers’ compensation, actuarial assumptions for the pension and postretirement
plans, estimates of future cash flows associated with goodwill and long-lived
assets, environmental and warranty reserves, and amounts reported under
long-term contracts. Management’s estimates are based on the facts and
circumstances available at the time estimates are made, historical experience,
risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends, and management’s
assessments of the probable future outcomes of these matters. Actual results
could differ from such estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and
short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months
or less.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is generally recognized when products are
delivered or services are performed. With respect to aircraft, delivery is upon
completion of manufacturing, customer acceptance, and the transfer of the risk
and rewards of ownership.

When a sale arrangement involves multiple elements,
such as sales of products that include customization and other services, the
deliverables in the arrangement are evaluated to determine whether they
represent separate units of accounting. This evaluation occurs at inception of
the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered. The total fee
from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on its
relative fair value, taking into consideration any performance, cancellation,
termination or refund type provisions. Fair value for each element is
established generally based on the sales price charged when the same or similar
element is sold separately. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition
criteria for each unit of accounting are met.

Revenue from certain qualifying noncancelable
aircraft and other product lease contracts are accounted for as sales-type
leases. The present value of all payments (net of executory costs and any
guaranteed residual values) is recorded as revenue, and the related costs of
the product are charged to Cost of Sales. Generally, these leases are financed
through Textron Finance, and the associated interest is recorded over the term
of the lease agreement using the interest method. Lease financing transactions
that do not qualify as sales-type leases are accounted for under the operating
method with the revenue recorded as earned over the lease period.

Aircraft sales with guaranteed minimum resale values
are viewed as leases and are accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues
Task Force No. 95-1, “Revenue Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed
Minimum Resale Value.” To determine whether the transaction should be
classified as an operating lease or as a sales-type lease, the minimum lease
payments generally represent the difference between the proceeds upon the
equipment’s initial transfer and the present value of the residual value
guarantee to the purchaser as of the first exercise date of the guarantee. If
residual value insurance is obtained, the present value of the residual value
insurance is also included in the minimum lease payments. Textron assesses the
market values of the aircraft using both industry publications as well as
actual sales of used aircraft. For fixed-wing aircraft, specific information
related to the individual aircraft such as hours and condition may be
available, and market value assessments are adjusted accordingly. For rotor
aircraft, the guarantee arrangements require certain physical condition
minimums and/or require the aircraft to be covered under an extended
maintenance plan. Rotor aircraft fair value estimates are valued accordingly.
Losses are recorded currently if the estimated market value of the aircraft at
the exercise date is less than the guaranteed amount.

Long-Term Contracts

Long-term contracts are accounted for under American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position No. 81-1, “Accounting
for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts.”
Revenue under fixed-price contracts is generally recorded as deliveries are
made under the units-of-delivery method. Certain long-term fixed-price
contracts provide for periodic delivery after a lengthy period of time over
which significant costs are incurred or require a significant amount of development
effort in relation to total contract volume. Revenues under those contracts and
all cost-reimbursement-type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred under
the cost-to-cost method. Certain contracts are awarded with fixed-price
incentive fees. Incentive fees are considered when estimating revenues and
profit rates and are recorded when these amounts are reasonably determinable.
Long-term contract profits are based on estimates of total sales value and
costs at completion. Such estimates are reviewed and revised periodically
throughout the contract life. Revisions to contract profits are recorded when
the revisions to estimated sales value or costs are made. Estimated contract
losses are recorded when identified.

Bell Helicopter has a joint venture with The Boeing
Company (“Boeing”) to provide engineering, development and test services
related to the V-22 aircraft, as well as to produce the V-22 aircraft, under a
number of separate contracts with the U.S. Government (the “V-22 Contracts”).
The V-22 Contracts include the development contract and various production
release contracts (i.e., lots) that may run concurrently with multiple
earlier lots still being produced as new lots are started. The development
contract and the first three production lots are under cost-reimbursement-type
contracts, while subsequent lots are under fixed-price-type contracts. The
first three lots under fixed-price incentive contracts have been accounted for
under the cost-to-cost method, primarily as a result of the significant
engineering effort required over a lengthy period of time


during the initial development
phase in relation to total contract volume. The production releases on the
first six production lots include separately contracted modifications to meet
the additional requirements of the U.S. Government’s Blue Ribbon Panel.
Beginning in 2003, the development effort was considered substantially complete
for the new production releases and management believed a consistent production
specification had been met as these units incorporate many of these
modifications on the production line. Accordingly, revenue on the new
production releases that began in 2003 is recognized under the
units-of-delivery method.

Finance Revenues

Finance revenues include interest on finance
receivables, which is recognized using the interest method to provide a
constant rate of return over the terms of the receivables. Finance revenues
also include direct loan origination costs and fees received, which are
deferred and amortized over the contractual lives of the respective receivables
using the interest method. Unamortized amounts are recognized in revenues when
receivables are sold or prepaid. Accrual of interest income is suspended for accounts
that are contractually delinquent by more than three months unless collection
is not doubtful. In addition, detailed reviews of loans may result in
earlier suspension if collection is doubtful. Accrual of interest is resumed
when the loan becomes contractually current, and suspended interest income is
recognized at that time.

Losses on Finance Receivables

Provisions for losses on finance receivables are
charged to income in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance at a level
considered adequate to cover losses in the existing receivable portfolio.
Management evaluates the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the
characteristics of the existing accounts, historical loss experience, the value
of the underlying collateral, and general economic conditions and trends.
Finance receivables are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible.
Finance receivables are written down to the fair value (less estimated costs to
sell) of the related collateral at the earlier of the date the collateral is
repossessed or when no payment has been received for six months unless
management deems the receivable collectible.

Loan Impairment

Textron Finance periodically evaluates finance
receivables, excluding homogeneous loan portfolios and finance leases, for
impairment. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that Textron
Finance will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual
terms of the loan agreement. In addition, Textron Finance identifies loans that
are considered impaired due to the significant modification of the original
loan terms to reflect deferred principal payments generally at market interest
rates but which continue to accrue finance charges since full collection of
principal and interest is not doubtful. Impairment is measured by comparing the
fair value of a loan with its carrying amount. Fair value is based on the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective
interest rate, the loan’s observable market price or, if the loan is collateral
dependent, at the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs. If the fair
value of the loan is less than its carrying amount, Textron Finance establishes
a reserve based on this difference. This evaluation is inherently subjective as
it requires estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows
expected to be received on impaired loans, that may differ from actual
results.

Securitized Transactions

Textron Finance sells or securitizes loans and leases
and may retain an interest in the assets sold in the form of
servicing responsibilities and subordinated interests, including interest-only
securities, seller certificates and cash reserves. These retained interests are
subordinate to other investors’ interests in the securitizations. A gain or
loss on the sale of finance receivables depends, in part, on the previous
carrying amount of the finance receivables involved in the transfer, allocated
between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair
values at the date of transfer. Retained interests are recorded at fair value
as a component of Other Assets.

Textron Finance estimates fair value based on the
present value of future expected cash flows using management’s best estimates
of key assumptions: credit losses, prepayment speeds, forward interest rate
yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. Textron
Finance reviews the fair values of the retained interests quarterly using
updated assumptions and compares such amounts with the carrying value of the
retained interests. When the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the
retained interests and the decline in fair value is determined to be other than
temporary, the retained interest is written down to fair value with a corresponding
charge to income. When a change in the fair value of the retained interest is
deemed temporary, any unrealized gains or losses are included in Shareholders’
Equity as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.

Investments

Investments in marketable equity securities are
classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value as a component
of Other Assets. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of income
taxes, are included in Shareholders’ Equity as a component of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss. Investments in non-marketable equity securities are
accounted for under either the cost or equity method of accounting. Textron
periodically reviews investment securities for impairment based on criteria
that include the duration of the market value decline, Textron’s


ability to hold to recovery,
information regarding the market and industry trends for the investee’s
business, the financial strength and specific prospects of the investee, and
investment analyst reports, if available. If a decline in the fair value of an
investment security is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis is
written down to fair value with a charge to earnings.

In the normal course of business, Textron has entered
into various joint venture agreements that are not controlled by Textron but
where Textron has the ability to exercise significant influence over the
operating and financial policies. Textron’s investments in these ventures are
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. At December 31, 2005
and January 1, 2005, Textron Manufacturing’s investment in these
unconsolidated joint ventures totaled $16 million and $13 million,
respectively, and is included in Other Assets. In addition, at January 1,
2005, distributions from one of the joint ventures exceeded Textron’s
investment by $18 million. Under the equity method, only Textron’s share of the
ventures’ net earnings and losses is included in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. Textron Manufacturing’s share of net income (loss) from these
ventures totaled $1 million in 2005, $(11) million in 2004 and $(14) million in
2003. Since these amounts are not considered material for separate
presentation, they are included within Cost of Sales.

Textron’s joint venture agreement with Boeing creates
contractual, rather than ownership, rights related to the V-22. Accordingly,
Textron does not account for this joint venture under the equity method of
accounting. Textron accounts for all of Bell Helicopter’s rights and
obligations under the specific requirements of the V-22 Contracts allocated to
Bell Helicopter under the joint venture agreement. Revenues and cost of sales
reflect Bell Helicopter’s performance under the V-22 Contracts. All assets used
in performance of the V-22 Contracts owned by Bell Helicopter, including
inventory and unpaid receivables, and all liabilities arising from Bell
Helicopter’s obligations under the V-22 Contracts, are included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Inventories

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or
estimated net realizable value. The cost of approximately 70% of inventories is
determined using the last-in, first-out method (“LIFO”). The cost of remaining
inventories, other than those related to certain long-term contracts, is
generally valued by the first-in, first-out method (“FIFO”). Costs for
commercial helicopters are determined on an average cost basis by model
considering the expended and estimated costs for the current production
release. Customer deposits are recorded against inventory when the right of
offset exists. All other customer deposits are recorded as liabilities.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost
and are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method. Land improvements
and buildings are depreciated primarily over estimated lives ranging from five
to 40 years, while machinery and equipment are depreciated primarily over three
to 15 years. Expenditures for improvements that increase asset values and
extend useful lives are capitalized.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, including intangible assets
subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable. Management assesses the recoverability of the cost of the asset
based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows. In the event an
impairment loss is identified, it is recognized based on the amount by which
the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset. If
an asset is held for sale, management reviews its estimated fair value less
cost to sell. Fair value is determined using pertinent market information,
including appraisals or brokers’ estimates and/or projected discounted cash
flows.

Goodwill

Management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as
declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the
business climate, indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit or
indefinite-lived intangible asset might be impaired. The reporting unit
represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is
prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that
operating segment (a “component”), in which case such component is the
reporting unit. In certain instances, components of an operating segment have
been aggregated and deemed to be a single reporting unit based on similar
economic characteristics of the components. Goodwill is considered to be
impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair
value. Fair values are established primarily using a discounted cash flow
methodology. The determination of discounted cash flows is based on the
businesses’ strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts. When available,
comparative market multiples are used to corroborate discounted cash flow
results.


Derivative Financial Instruments

Textron is exposed to market
risk primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and
securities pricing. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures,
Textron nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural
offsets. For the residual portion, Textron enters into various derivative
transactions pursuant to Textron’s policies in areas such as counterparty
exposure and hedging practices. All derivative instruments are reported on the
balance sheet at fair value. Designation to support hedge accounting is
performed on a specific exposure basis. Changes in fair value of financial
instruments qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded in income, offset in
part or in whole, by corresponding changes in the fair value of the
underlying exposures being hedged. Changes in fair values of derivatives
accounted for as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective as hedges,
are recorded in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income, net of deferred taxes.
Changes in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are reported in
income. Textron does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities
are translated into U.S. dollars with the adjustments from the currency rate
changes recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account in
Shareholders’ Equity until the related foreign entity is sold or substantially
liquidated. Foreign currency financing transactions, including currency swaps,
are used to effectively hedge long-term investments in foreign operations with
the same corresponding currency. Foreign currency gains and losses on the hedge
of the long-term investments are recorded in the cumulative translation
adjustment account in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss with the offset
recorded as an adjustment to the non-U.S. dollar financing liability.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, and variable-rate receivables and debt
approximate carrying value. The estimated fair values of other financial
instruments, including debt, equity and risk management instruments, have been
determined using available market information and valuation methodologies,
primarily discounted cash flow analysis or independent investment bankers. The
estimated fair value of nonperforming loans included in finance receivables is
based on discounted cash flow analyses using risk-adjusted interest rates or
the fair value of the related collateral. Because considerable judgment is
required in interpreting market data, the estimates are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market.

Product and Environmental
Liabilities

Product liability claims are accrued on the
occurrence method based on insurance coverage and deductibles in effect at the
date of the incident and management’s assessment of the probability of loss
when reasonably estimable.

Accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a
site-by-site basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and
the amount is reasonably estimated. Textron’s environmental liabilities are
undiscounted and do not take into consideration possible future insurance
proceeds or significant amounts from claims against other third parties.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs not specifically
covered by contracts and those related to Textron’s share of research and
development activity in connection with cost-sharing arrangements are charged
to expense as incurred. Research and development costs incurred under contracts
with others are reported as cost of sales over the period that revenue is
recognized, consistent with Textron’s contract accounting policy.

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for
the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the
evaluation of available evidence, Textron recognizes future tax benefits, such
as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that management believes it
is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized. Management
periodically assesses the likelihood that Textron will be able to recover its
deferred tax assets and reflects any changes in estimates in the valuation
allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or Other Comprehensive
Income (Loss), as appropriate. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance,
management looks to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary
differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, the feasibility of tax
planning strategies and estimated future taxable income.

Note 2. Discontinued Operations

Textron’s Consolidated Financial Statements and
related footnote disclosures reflect Textron Fastening Systems and the InteSys,
OmniQuip and small business direct businesses as discontinued operations, net
of applicable income taxes, for all periods presented in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”


Textron Manufacturing generally uses a centralized
approach to the cash management and financing of its operations and,
accordingly, does not allocate debt or interest expense to its discontinued
businesses. Any debt and related interest expense of a specific entity within a
business is recorded by the respective entity. General corporate overhead
previously allocated to the businesses for reporting purposes is excluded from
amounts reported as discontinued operations.

Textron Fastening Systems –

During 2005, the Textron Fastening Systems
business experienced declining sales volumes and profits. Volumes were down due
to soft demand in the automotive market and operating difficulties. Profits
were down due to the lower volumes, a lag in the ability to recover higher
steel costs and inefficiencies associated with the consolidation of
manufacturing operations in North America. Due to the continuation of these
conditions, further softening of demand in the North American automotive market
and an expected decline in the European automotive market, Textron’s Management
Committee initiated a special review at the end of August to consider
strategic alternatives for the segment, including the potential sale of all or
portions of its operations.

On September 6, 2005, Textron’s Board of
Directors approved management’s recommendation to explore strategic
alternatives for the segment. Based on the approval of this recommendation and
the likelihood of execution, Textron determined on September 6, 2005 that
an impairment indicator existed for both the Fastening Systems’ goodwill and
its long-lived assets. In its assessment of potential impairment of the
goodwill, management estimated the fair value of the business using independent
third-party valuations. This fair value amount was then compared to the
carrying amount of the segment. As the carrying amount exceeded the fair value,
management then measured the amount of goodwill impairment loss. The excess of
the fair value of the segment over the fair value amounts assigned to its
assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. The
carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that
goodwill, resulting in an impairment loss of $335 million recorded in the third
quarter of 2005.

In December 2005, Textron’s Board of Directors
authorized the divestiture of the Textron Fastening Systems business. With this
approval, Textron has committed to actively market the segment and anticipates
no significant changes to the approved plan and the completion of the sale
within the next twelve months. Textron recorded an after-tax charge of
approximately $52 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, which includes $37
million related to previously deferred foreign currency translation losses and
$2 million of tax charges, both related to the non-U.S.-based business, as well
as $7 million related to curtailment losses for employee retirement plans.
After these charges, management assessed the estimated fair value of the
business and determined that no further adjustment to the carrying value was
required. In addition, approximately $6 million in after-tax deal-related costs
primarily for professional services and advisory fees were incurred during the
quarter.

InteSys –

Textron reached a final decision in the
fourth quarter of 2004 to sell the remainder of its InteSys operations, which
was previously included in the Industrial segment. The carrying value of this
business approximated fair value at the date of the decision to sell. Textron
sold this business in February 2005 and recorded an after-tax gain of
approximately $49 million, primarily related to a tax benefit.

OmniQuip –

On August 1, 2003, Textron consummated
the sale of its remaining OmniQuip business to JLG Industries, Inc. for
$100 million. Prior to this consummation, Textron recorded $30 million for the
impairment of $15 million in intangible assets and $15 million in goodwill
based on the fair value implied by the sale price under negotiation at that
time.

Textron Manufacturing retained certain liabilities of
the OmniQuip business. These liabilities totaled approximately $23 million at December 31,
2005 and included reserves related to a recourse liability to cover potential
losses on approximately $30 million in finance receivables held by Textron
Finance. See Note 5 for further discussion on transactions between Textron’s
Manufacturing and Finance borrowing groups.

Small Business Direct –

In 2003, Textron Finance sold its small
business direct portfolio for $421 million in cash. Based upon the terms of the
transaction, no gain or loss was recorded. Textron Finance entered into a
loss-sharing agreement related to the sale, which requires Textron Finance to
reimburse the purchaser for 50% of losses incurred on the portfolio above a 4%
annual level. Due to the nature of the loss-sharing agreement, there is no
maximum guarantee amount related to the remaining $380 million portfolio.
Textron Finance originally recorded a liability of $14 million representing the
estimated fair value of the guarantee, which expires in 2008. As of December 31,
2005, Textron Finance has reimbursed the purchaser a total of $4 million under
this agreement, and has recorded an additional $4 million liability based on
revisions to the estimated fair value of the guarantee. These revisions reflect
management’s best estimate of the amounts potentially reimbursable to the
purchaser based on historical loss experience and the estimated attrition of
the portfolio. At December 31, 2005, the estimated fair value of the
guarantee was a $13 million liability.


The assets and liabilities of these discontinued
businesses are as follows:

Operating results of the discontinued businesses are
as follows:

Prior to the disposition of these businesses,
approximately $289 million in restructuring costs related to Textron Fastening
Systems, InteSys and OmniQuip were recorded in Special Charges since the
inception of Textron’s restructuring program.

Note 3. Acquisitions

Textron has a joint venture, CitationShares, with TAG
Aviation USA, Inc. (“TAG”) to sell fractional share interests in business
jets and limited advance purchase jet charter. On June 30, 2004, Textron
acquired an additional 25% interest in CitationShares from TAG for cash and the
assumption of debt guarantees previously provided by TAG. Assets acquired of
$47 million included $22 million of inventory, primarily Citation jets, and
liabilities acquired of $59 million included $47 million of third-party debt
that was immediately repaid. As a result of this transaction, Textron owned 75%
of CitationShares and consolidated its financial results prospectively as of June 30,
2004.

Additional cash consideration may also be
payable to TAG based on CitationShares’ future operating results. In 2005,
Textron increased its ownership interest to 82.2% through additional capital
contributions of $26 million. TAG has the right to sell its remaining interest
to Textron in the years 2009 through 2011, and Textron has the right to
purchase the remaining interest in 2010 or 2011, for an amount based on a
multiple of earnings.


Note 4. Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable is composed of the following:

Unbillable receivables on U.S. Government contracts
arise when the revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately
recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract. Unbillable receivables
within Accounts Receivable totaled $125 million at December 31, 2005 and
$133 million at January 1, 2005. Long-term contract receivables due from
the U.S. Government do not include significant amounts billed but unpaid due to
contractual retainage provisions or subject to collection uncertainty.

Note 5. Finance Receivables and
Securitizations

Finance Receivables

Textron Finance provides financial services primarily
to the aircraft, golf, vacation interval resort, dealer floorplan and middle
market industries under a variety of financing vehicles with various
contractual maturities.

Installment contracts generally require the customer
to pay a significant down payment, along with periodic scheduled principal
payments that reduce the outstanding balance through the term of the loan.
Finance leases include residual values expected to be realized at contractual
maturity. Finance leases with no significant residual value at the end of the
contractual term are classified as installment contracts, as their legal and
economic substance is more equivalent to a secured borrowing than a finance
lease with a significant residual value. Installment contracts and finance
leases have initial terms ranging from two to 20 years and are primarily
secured by the financed equipment.

Distribution finance receivables are generally
secured by the inventory of the financed distributor and include floor plan
financing for third-party dealers for inventory sold by the E-Z-GO and Jacobsen
businesses. Revolving loans are secured by trade receivables, inventory, plant
and equipment, pools of vacation interval notes receivables, pools of
residential and recreational land loans, and the underlying property.
Distribution finance and revolving loans generally mature within one to five
years.

Golf course and resort mortgages are secured by real
property and are generally limited to 75% or less of the property’s appraised
market value at loan origination. Golf course mortgages have initial terms
ranging from five to seven years with amortization periods from 15 to 25 years.
Resort mortgages generally represent construction and inventory loans with
terms up to two years. Leveraged leases are secured by the ownership of the
leased equipment and real property and have initial terms up to approximately
30 years.

The following table displays the contractual maturity
of the finance receivables. It does not necessarily reflect future cash
collections because of various factors, including the repayment or refinancing
of receivables prior to contractual maturity:


Contractual maturities for finance leases classified
as installment contracts include the minimum lease payments, net of the
unearned income to be recognized over the life of the lease. Total minimum
lease payments and unearned income related to these finance leases were $751
million and $164 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005 and $708
million and $136 million, respectively, at January 1, 2005. Minimum lease
payments due under these contracts for each of the next five years are as
follows: $150 million in 2006, $125 million in 2007, $109 million in 2008, $108
million in 2009 and $81 million in 2010.

Textron Finance’s net investment in finance leases,
excluding leases classified as installment contracts, is provided below:

Minimum lease payments due under finance leases for
each of the next five years are as follows: $99 million in 2006, $87 million in
2007, $67 million in 2008, $37 million in 2009 and $11 million in 2010.

The net investment in leveraged leases was as
follows:

Excluding receivables with recourse to Textron
Manufacturing, at the end of 2005 and 2004, Textron Finance had nonaccrual
finance receivables totaling $89 million and $119 million, respectively, of
which $67 million and $85 million, respectively, were impaired. In addition,
Textron Finance had impaired accrual finance receivables totaling $36 million
at December 31, 2005 and $58 million at January 1, 2005. The allowance
for losses on finance receivables related to impaired loans is determined using
assumptions related to the fair market value of the underlying collateral and
totaled $18 million and $16 million at the end of 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The average recorded investment in impaired loans during 2005 was $113 million,
compared with $145 million in 2004. No interest income was recognized on these
loans using the cash basis method.

Textron Finance manages and services finance
receivables for a variety of investors, participants and third-party portfolio
owners. The total managed and serviced finance receivable portfolio, including
owned finance receivables, was $9.9 billion at the end of 2005 and $9.3 billion
at the end of 2004. Managed receivables include owned finance receivables and
finance receivables sold in securitizations and private transactions where
Textron Finance has retained some element of credit risk and continues to
service the portfolio.

At December 31, 2005, Textron Finance’s
receivables were primarily diversified geographically across the United States,
along with 14% in other countries. The most significant collateral
concentration was in general aviation aircraft, which accounted for 19% of
managed receivables. Textron Finance also has industry concentrations in the
golf and vacation interval industries, which each accounted for 17% and 13%,
respectively, of managed receivables at December 31, 2005.


Transactions between Finance and Manufacturing
Groups

A portion of Textron Finance’s business involves
financing retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment
manufactured by Textron Manufacturing. The captive finance receivables for
these inventory sales that are included in Textron Finance’s balance sheet are
composed of the following:

Operating agreements specify that Textron Finance has
recourse to Textron Manufacturing for certain uncollected amounts related to
these transactions. For those receivables for which collection has been
guaranteed by Textron Manufacturing, reserves have been established for losses
on Textron Manufacturing’s balance sheet and are recorded in current or
long-term liabilities. These reserves are established for amounts that are
potentially uncollectible or if the collateral values may be insufficient
to cover the outstanding receivable. If an account is deemed uncollectible and
the collateral is repossessed, Textron Finance will charge Textron
Manufacturing for any deficiency. In some cases, the collateral is not
repossessed by Textron Finance, and the receivable is transferred to Textron
Manufacturing’s balance sheet for additional collection efforts. When this
occurs, any related reserve previously established by Textron Manufacturing is
reclassified from current or long-term liabilities to a contra asset account.

In 2005, 2004 and 2003, Textron Finance paid Textron
Manufacturing $0.8 billion, $0.9 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively,
relating to the sale of manufactured products to third parties that were
financed by Textron Finance, and $41 million, $77 million and $56 million,
respectively, for the purchase of equipment on operating leases. At the end of
2005 and 2004, the amounts guaranteed by Textron Manufacturing totaled $344
million and $384 million, respectively. In addition, at the end of 2005 and
2004, Textron Finance had recourse to Textron Manufacturing for leases with
Collins and Aikman Corporation (“C&A”) totaling approximately $70 million
and $82 million, respectively.

For finance receivables guaranteed by Textron
Manufacturing, Textron Finance continues to recognize income on past-due loans
that meet the nonaccrual criteria. Accordingly, these past-due loans are not
classified as nonaccrual by Textron Finance. Concurrently, Textron
Manufacturing is charged for its obligation to Textron Finance under the
guarantee so that there are no net interest earnings for the loans on a
consolidated basis. At the end of 2005 and 2004, past-due loans guaranteed by
Textron Manufacturing totaled $8 million and $31 million, respectively.
Reserves for losses related to these guarantees are included in Textron
Manufacturing’s Other Current Liabilities and Other Liabilities and totaled $36
million and $48 million at the end of 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Securitizations

Textron Finance received proceeds of $0.4 billion in
both 2005 and 2004 from the securitization and sale (with servicing rights
retained) of finance receivables. Gains from securitized trust sales were
approximately $49 million in 2005, $56 million in 2004 and $43 million in 2003.
At the end of 2005, $2.3 billion in securitized loans were outstanding, with $9
million in past-due loans. Textron Finance has securitized certain receivables
for which it has retained full recourse to Textron Manufacturing.

Textron Finance retained subordinated interests in
the trusts which are approximately 2% to 10% of the total trust. Servicing fees
range from 75 to 150 basis points. During 2005, key economic assumptions used
in measuring the retained interests at the date of each securitization included
prepayment speeds ranging from 17.5% to 24.3%, weighted-average lives ranging
from 0.3 to 3.2 years, expected credit losses ranging from 0.4% to 0.5% and
residual cash flows discount rates ranging from 7.1% to 9.2%. At December 31,
2005, key economic assumptions used in measuring these retained interests were
as follows:


Hypothetical adverse changes of 10% and 20% to either
the prepayment speed, expected credit losses or residual cash flows discount
rates assumptions would not have a material impact on the current fair value of
the residual cash flows associated with the retained interests. These
hypothetical sensitivities should be used with caution, as the effect of a
variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest
is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, a change in
one factor may result in a change in another factor that may magnify
or counteract the sensitivities losses. For example, increases in market
interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit
losses.

Note 6. Inventories

Inventories are composed of the following:

Inventories aggregating $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion
at the end of 2005 and 2004, respectively, were valued by the LIFO method. Had
such LIFO inventories been valued at current costs, their carrying values would
have been approximately $251 million and $221 million higher at those
respective dates. The remaining inventories, other than those related to
certain long-term contracts, are valued primarily by the FIFO method.
Inventories related to long-term contracts, net of progress/milestone payments
were $350 million at the end of 2005 and $259 million at the end of 2004.

Note 7. Property, Plant and
Equipment, net

Property, plant and equipment, net for Textron
Manufacturing is composed of the following:

Note 8. Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

Changes in goodwill are summarized below:


All of Textron’s acquired intangible assets are
subject to amortization and are composed of the following:

Amortization expense totaled $4 million in 2005, $6
million in 2004 and $9 million in 2003. For each of the next five years,
amortization expense is estimated to be approximately $3 million.

Note 9. Debt and Credit Facilities

Debt and credit facilities are composed of the
following:

Textron Manufacturing maintains credit facilities
with various banks for both short- and long-term borrowings. Textron
Manufacturing has primary revolving credit facilities of $1.3 billion that
expire in March 2010. Textron Manufacturing’s credit facilities permit
Textron Finance to borrow under these facilities. At December 31, 2005 and
January 1, 2005, none of the primary revolving credit facilities were used
or reserved as support for commercial paper. The weighted-average interest
rates for these facilities in 2005 and 2004 were 3.0% and 1.7%, respectively.

*

The weighted-average interest
rates on these borrowings before the effect of interest rate exchange
agreements were 4.4% and 2.4% at the end of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and
3.3% for the year 2005 and 1.6% for the year 2004.


Textron Finance has committed bank lines of credit of
$1.5 billion, of which $500 million expires in July 2006 and $1.0 billion
expires in 2010. The $500 million facility includes a one-year term out option
that can effectively extend its expiration into 2007. Textron Finance’s lines
of credit, not reserved as support for outstanding commercial paper or letters
of credit at December 31, 2005, were $300 million. None of these lines of
credit was used at December 31, 2005 or January 1, 2005. Lending
agreements limit Textron Finance’s net assets available for dividends and other
payments to Textron Manufacturing to approximately $384 million of Textron
Finance’s net assets of $1.1 billion at the end of 2005. These lending
agreements also contain various restrictive provisions regarding additional
debt (not to exceed 800% of consolidated net worth and qualifying subordinated
obligations), minimum net worth ($200 million), creation of liens and the
maintenance of a fixed charges coverage ratio (no less than 125%).

The following table shows required payments during
the next five years on debt outstanding at the end of 2005. The payment schedule excludes
amounts that are payable under or supported by the primary revolving credit
facilities or revolving lines of credit:

Textron Manufacturing has agreed to cause Textron
Finance to maintain certain minimum levels of financial performance. No
payments from Textron Manufacturing were necessary in 2005, 2004 or 2003 for
Textron Finance to meet these standards.

Cash paid for interest by Textron Manufacturing
totaled $108 million, $106 million and $113 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and included $5 million, $4 million and $5 million in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively, paid to Textron Finance. Cash paid for interest by
Textron Finance totaled $204 million, $157 million and $182 million in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Note 10. Derivatives and Other
Financial Instruments

Fair Value Interest Rate Hedges

Textron Manufacturing manages interest cost using a
mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. To manage this mix in a cost efficient
manner, Textron Manufacturing enters into interest rate exchange agreements to
swap, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable
interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal
amount. These hedges are considered perfectly effective since the critical
terms of the debt and the interest rate exchange match and the other conditions
of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” are met. The mark-to-market values of both the fair value hedge
instruments and underlying debt obligations are recorded as equal and
offsetting realized gains and losses in Interest Expense. At December 31,
2005, Textron Manufacturing had interest rate exchange agreements with a fair
value liability of $10 million. In addition, Textron Manufacturing had $5
million of deferred gains related to discontinued hedges that are being
amortized as an adjustment to Interest Expense over the remaining life of the underlying
debt of 33 months.

Textron Finance enters into interest rate exchange
agreements in order to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of its
fixed-rate portfolios of receivables and debt due to fluctuations in interest
rates. These agreements convert the fixed-rate cash flows to floating-rate cash
flows. At December 31, 2005, Textron Finance had interest exchange
agreements with a fair value liability of $43 million designated as fair value
hedges, compared with $11 million at January 1, 2005.

Textron Finance utilizes foreign currency interest
rate exchange agreements to hedge its exposure, in a Canadian dollar functional
currency subsidiary, to changes in the fair value of $60 million U.S. dollar
denominated fixed-rate debt as a result of changes in both foreign currency
exchange rates and Canadian Banker’s Acceptance rates. At December 31,
2005, these instruments had a fair value liability of $9 million, compared with
$6 million at January 1, 2005. Textron Finance’s fair value hedges are highly
effective, resulting in an immaterial net impact to earnings due to hedge
ineffectiveness.

Cash Flow Interest Rate Hedges

Textron Finance enters into interest rate exchange,
cap and floor agreements to mitigate its exposure to variability in the cash
flows received from its investments in interest-only securities resulting from
securitizations, which is caused by fluctuations in interest rates. The
combination of these instruments convert net residual floating-rate cash flows
expected to be received by Textron Finance as a result of the securitization
trust’s assets, liabilities and derivative instruments to fixed-rate cash
flows. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded net of the
income


tax effect in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). At December 31,
2005, these instruments had a fair value liability of $5 million, compared with
$8 million at January 1, 2005. Textron Finance expects approximately $0.2
million of net tax deferred gains to be reclassified to earnings related to
these hedge relationships in 2006.

At December 31, 2005, Textron Finance had $4
million of deferred losses, net of income taxes, recorded in Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss) related to terminated forward starting interest
rate exchange agreements. These agreements were executed to hedge the exposure
to the variability in cash flows from anticipated future issuances of
fixed-rate debt and were terminated upon issuance of the debt. Textron Finance
is amortizing the deferred losses into Interest Expense over the remaining life
of the hedged debt of 26 months and expects approximately $2 million, in
deferred losses, net of income taxes, to be reclassified to earnings in 2006.

For cash flow hedges, Textron Finance recorded an
after-tax loss of $5 million in 2005 and $7 million in 2004 and a gain of $12
million in 2003 to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss with no impact to the
Statements of Operations. Textron Finance has not incurred or recognized any
significant net gain or loss in earnings as the result of the ineffectiveness,
or the exclusion of any component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness,
of its cash flow hedges in 2005 and 2004.

Textron had minimal exposure to loss from
nonperformance by the counterparties to its interest rate exchange agreements
at the end of 2005 and does not anticipate nonperformance by counterparties in
the periodic settlements of amounts due. Textron currently minimizes this
potential for risk by entering into contracts exclusively with major,
financially sound counterparties having no less than a long-term bond rating of
“A,” by continuously monitoring such credit ratings and by limiting exposure to
any one financial institution. The credit risk generally is limited to the
amount by which the counterparties’ contractual obligations exceed Textron’s
obligations to the counterparty.

Cash Flow Foreign Exchange Rate
Hedges

Textron manufactures and sells its products in a
number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to
movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary purpose of Textron’s
foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the volatility associated with
foreign currency purchases of materials, foreign currency sales of its products,
and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business.
Textron primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts and purchased options
with maturities of no more than 18 months that qualify as cash flow hedges.
These are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on
forecasted sales, inventory purchases and overhead expenses. The fair value of
these instruments at December 31, 2005 was a $23 million receivable. At
year-end 2005, a $21 million after-tax gain was reported in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss from qualifying cash flow hedges. This gain is generally
expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next 12 months as the underlying
transactions occur. Textron Manufacturing also enters into certain foreign currency
derivative instruments that do not meet hedge accounting criteria and are
primarily intended to protect against exposure related to intercompany
financing transactions and income from international operations. The fair value
of these instruments at the end of 2005 and the net impact of the related gains
and losses on selling and administrative expense in 2005 were not material.

Net Investment Hedging

Textron hedges its net investment position in major
currencies and generates foreign currency interest payments that offset other
transactional exposures in these currencies. To accomplish this, Textron
borrows directly in foreign currency and designates a portion of foreign
currency debt as a hedge of net investments. Textron may also utilize currency
forwards as hedges of its related foreign net investments. Currency effects of
these hedges, which are reflected in the cumulative translation adjustment
account within Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), produced a $49 million
after-tax gain during 2005, leaving an accumulated net income balance of $30
million.

Stock-Based Compensation Hedging

Textron manages the expense related to stock-based
compensation awards using cash settlement forward contracts on its common
stock. The use of these forward contracts modifies compensation expense
exposure to changes in the stock price with the intent to reduce potential
variability. The fair value of these instruments at December 31, 2005 and January 1,
2005 was a receivable of $10 million and $31 million, respectively. Gains and
losses on these instruments are recorded as an adjustment to compensation
expense when the award is charged to expense. These contracts impacted net
income by $8 million in 2005, $28 million in 2004 and $23 million in 2003. Cash
received or paid on the contract settlement is included in cash flows from
operating activities, consistent with the classification of the cash flows on
the underlying hedged compensation expense.


Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of
Textron’s financial instruments that are not reflected in the financial
statements at fair value are as follows:

Finance receivables exclude the fair value of finance
and leveraged leases totaling $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005 and $0.9
billion at January 1, 2005 as these leases are recorded at fair value in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 11. Mandatorily Redeemable
Preferred Securities

Textron adopted SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity,” in the third quarter of 2003. Upon adoption, Textron Finance
classified its obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities previously
classified as equity as a liability.

In June 2004, Textron Financial Corporation
redeemed all of its $26 million Litchfield 10% Series A Junior
Subordinated Debentures, due 2029. The debentures were held by a trust
sponsored and wholly owned by Litchfield Financial Corporation, a subsidiary of
Textron Financial Corporation. The proceeds from the redemption were used to
redeem all of the $26 million Litchfield Capital Trust I 10% Series A
Trust Preferred Securities at par value of $10 per share. There was no gain or
loss on the redemption.

In July 2003, Textron redeemed its 7.92% Junior
Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures, due 2045. The debentures were held
by Textron’s wholly owned trust, and the proceeds from their redemption were
used to redeem all of the $500 million Textron Capital I trust preferred
securities with a 7.92% dividend yield. Upon the redemption, $15 million in
unamortized issuance costs were written off and recorded in Special Charges.

Note 12. Shareholders’ Equity

Capital Stock

Textron has authorization for 15,000,000 shares of
preferred stock and 500,000,000 shares of 12.5 cent per share par value common
stock. Each share of $2.08 Preferred Stock ($23.63 approximate stated value) is
convertible into 4.4 shares of common stock and can be redeemed by Textron for
$50 per share. Each share of $1.40 Preferred Dividend Stock ($11.82 approximate
stated value) is convertible into 3.6 shares of common stock and can be
redeemed by Textron for $45 per share.

Reserved Shares of Common Stock

At the end of 2005, common stock reserved for the
subsequent conversion of preferred stock and shares reserved for the exercise
of stock options were 2,596,000 and 8,146,000, respectively.

Income per Common Share

A reconciliation of income from continuing operations
and basic to diluted share amounts is presented below:


Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Included in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) is an
income tax (expense) benefit of $(12) million, $(22) million and $3 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Note 13. Share-Based Compensation

Summary of Share-Based Compensation
Plans

Textron’s 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”)
authorizes awards to key employees of Textron in the form of options to
purchase Textron shares and restricted stock. Options to purchase Textron
shares have a maximum term of ten years and, beginning with 2004 grants, vest
ratably over a three-year period. Grants awarded prior to 2004 vested ratably
over two years. Restricted stock grants vest one-third each in the third,
fourth and fifth year following the grant. The maximum number of shares
authorized under the Plan includes 17.5 million options to purchase Textron
shares and two million shares of restricted stock. Textron also provides
share-based compensation awards payable in cash, including retention awards to
certain executives and performance share units. Payouts under performance share
units vary based on certain performance criteria measured over a three-year
period. The performance share units vest at the end of three years.

The Deferred Income Plan for Textron Key Executives
(the “DIP”) provides participants the opportunity to voluntarily defer up to
25% of their base salary and up to 100% of annual and long-term incentive
compensation and other compensation. Elective deferrals may be put into either
a stock unit account or an interest bearing account. Textron generally
contributes a 10% premium on amounts deferred into the stock unit account.
Executives who are eligible to participate in the DIP who have not achieved
and/or maintained the required minimum stock ownership level are required to defer
annual incentive compensation in excess of 100% of the executive’s annual
target into a deferred stock unit account and are not entitled to the 10%
premium contribution on the amount deferred. Participants cannot move amounts
between the two accounts while actively employed by Textron and cannot receive
distributions until termination of employment.

Change in Accounting for
Share-Based Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
(Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123-R”), which replaces
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and supercedes
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees” (“APB No. 25”). SFAS No. 123-R requires companies to
measure compensation costs for share-based payments to employees, including
stock options, at fair value and expense such compensation over the service
period beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15,
2005. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed the
transition date for companies to the first fiscal year beginning after June 15,
2005, effectively delaying Textron’s required adoption of SFAS No. 123-R
until the first quarter of 2006.

Prior to 2005, Textron accounted for share-based
payments, including stock options issued under its Plan, using the intrinsic
value method of APB No. 25.

Textron elected to adopt SFAS No. 123-R in the
first quarter of 2005 using the modified prospective method. Under this
transition method, compensation expense recognized in 2005 includes: a)
compensation cost for all stock options and restricted stock granted prior to
but not yet vested as of January 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair
value estimated and recognized in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123
and b) compensation cost for all stock options and restricted stock granted
subsequent to January 1, 2005, and all share-based compensation awards
accounted for as liabilities, based upon the measurement and recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123-R. For awards granted or modified in 2005


and prospectively, compensation costs for awards with
only service conditions that vest ratably are recognized on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of
the award. Compensation costs for awards granted prior to 2005 are recognized
using the attribution methods required under SFAS No. 123. Upon adoption,
Textron re-measured its share-based compensation awards that are accounted for
as liabilities at fair value. The cumulative effect of adoption upon this
re-measurement resulted in an increase to net income of approximately $1
million in the first quarter of 2005, which is not considered to be material
and is recorded in selling and administrative expense. SFAS No. 123-R
requires that the excess tax benefits received related to stock option
exercises be presented as financing cash inflows. For 2005, $14 million of
these excess tax benefits have been presented as cash provided by financing
activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

The compensation expense that has been recorded in
net income for Textron’s share-based compensation plans is as follows:

Included in the table above are net compensation
costs recorded in discontinued operations of $2 million in 2005 and $1 million
in 2004. Share-based compensation costs have been reflected primarily in
selling and administrative expenses. For 2005, the expense includes attribution
of the fair value of options issued, as well as the portion of previously
granted options for which the requisite service was rendered, totaling
approximately $17 million. Of this amount, approximately $15 million has been
recorded in continuing operations and $2 million in discontinued operations.

The net impact of the adoption is as follows for the
year ended December 31, 2005:

Impact of SFAS No. 123-R
Adoption on Prior Periods

No compensation expense related to stock option
grants has been recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
years ended January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, as all of the
options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying stock on the date of grant. Results for prior periods have not been
restated.

The following table illustrates the effect on net
income and earnings per share if Textron had applied the fair value recognition
provisions required by SFAS No. 123-R prior to January 2, 2005:

* Net of related taxes and hedge income
or expense


Stock Options

The stock option compensation cost calculated under
the fair value approach is recognized over the vesting period of the stock
options. The weighted-average fair value of options granted per share was $20,
$14 and $10 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair values of options
granted are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities
from traded options on Textron common stock, historical volatilities and other
factors. Textron uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior,
adjusted to reflect anticipated increases in expected life.

The weighted-average assumptions used in Textron’s
Black-Scholes option-pricing model for awards issued during the respective
periods are as follows:

The following table summarizes information related to
stock option activity for the respective periods:

Stock option activity under the Plan is summarized as
follows:

Options that were outstanding and exercisable as of December 31,
2005 are as follows:

Restricted Stock

The fair value of restricted stock is based on the
trading price of Textron common stock on the date of grant, less required
adjustments to reflect the fair value of the award as dividends are not paid or
accrued until the restricted stock vests. The weighted-average grant-date fair
value of restricted stock granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $71,
$57 and $40 per share, respectively.


Restricted stock activity under the Plan for 2005 is
as follows:

Share-Based Compensation Awards
Accounted for as Liabilities

The fair value of share-based compensation awards
accounted for as liabilities includes performance share units, retention awards
and DIP stock unit awards. The fair value of these awards is based on the
trading price of Textron common stock, less adjustments to reflect the fair
value of the award as dividends are not paid or accrued until vested, and is
remeasured at each reporting period date.

Share-Based Compensation Awards

The value of the share-based compensation awards that
vested and/or were paid during the respective periods is as follows:

As of December 31, 2005, $58 million represents
the total compensation cost associated with unvested awards subject only to
service conditions that has not yet been recognized. Textron expects that this
compensation will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
two years. As of December 31, 2005, $25 million represents the total
compensation cost associated with unvested share-based compensation awards subject
to performance vesting conditions that has not yet been recognized. Textron
expects that this compensation will be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately two years.

Note 14. Pension Benefits and
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

Textron has defined benefit and defined contribution
pension plans that together cover substantially all employees. The cost of the
defined contribution plans amounted to approximately $45 million in 2005, $23
million in 2004 and $15 million in 2003. The increase in cost related to the
defined contribution plans reflects changes to Textron’s matching contribution
rate over the past three years. In April 2003, Textron temporarily
suspended matching contributions to its U.S.-based defined contribution plans
for non-bargained employees. Effective January 1, 2004, the matching
contributions were partially reinstated, with Textron matching $0.25 for each
$1.00 of employee contribution up to a maximum Textron matching contribution of
2.5% of eligible compensation. Matching contributions were raised to their
original level of $0.50 for each $1.00 of employee contribution up to a maximum
Textron matching contribution of 5% of eligible compensation in August 2004.

Defined benefits under salaried plans are based on
salary and years of service. Hourly plans generally provide benefits based on
stated amounts for each year of service. Textron’s funding policy is consistent
with federal law and regulations. Textron also offers healthcare and life
insurance benefits for certain retired employees, which are included below
under the “Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions” caption.


The components of Textron’s net periodic benefit cost
(income) are as follows:

Obligations and Funded Status

The following summarizes the changes in the benefit
obligation and in the fair value of plan assets and provides a reconciliation
of the funded status to the amounts recognized in the balance sheet for the
pension and postretirement benefit plans, along with the assumptions used to
determine benefit obligations:


Pension Benefits

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined
benefit pension plans was $4.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and $5.0
billion at January 1, 2005. Pension plans with accumulated benefit
obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets were as follows at
year-end:

In addition to the plans in the above table, at January 1,
2005 Textron had plans with an aggregate fair value of plan assets of $40
million, a projected benefit obligation of $63 million and an accumulated
benefit obligation of $41 million.


Textron’s pension assets are invested with the
objective of achieving a total rate of return, over the long term, sufficient
to fund future pension obligations and to minimize future pension
contributions. Textron is willing to tolerate a commensurate level of risk to
achieve this objective based on the funded status of the plans and the
long-term nature of Textron’s pension liability. Risk is controlled by
maintaining a portfolio of assets that is diversified across a variety of asset
classes, investment styles and investment managers. All of the assets are
managed by external investment managers, and the majority of the assets are
actively managed. Where possible, investment managers are prohibited from
owning Textron stock in the portfolios that they manage on behalf of Textron.

For U.S. plan assets, comprising the majority of plan
assets, asset allocation target ranges were established consistent with the
investment objectives, and the assets are rebalanced periodically. The expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets was determined based on a variety of
considerations, including the established asset allocation targets and
expectations for those asset classes, historical returns of the plans’ assets
and the advice of outside advisors. At December 31, 2005, the target
allocation range is 44% - 70% for equity securities, 13% - 33% for debt
securities and 7% - 13% for both real estate and for other assets. For foreign
plan assets, allocations are based on expected cash flow needs and assessments
of the local markets. Textron’s percentages of the fair value of total pension
plan assets by major category are as follows:

Postretirement Benefits Other than
Pensions

For measurement purposes, Textron has assumed an
annual medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rate of 11% for
covered healthcare benefits in 2005. The medical rate is assumed to decrease to
5% by 2009 and remain at that level. The prescription drug rate is expected to
rise to 12% in 2006, then decrease to 5% by 2013 and remain at that level.
Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for the healthcare plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed
healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects:

During the third quarter of 2004, Textron adopted
FASB Staff Position No. 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003” (the “Act”). The Act provides for a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare (“Medicare Part D”) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of
retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide benefits that are at least
actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Textron has determined that the
benefits it provides meet the equivalency tests as defined in the Act and has
included the effects of the subsidy as a reduction to the accumulated projected
benefit obligation of approximately $50 million. The total impact of the
subsidy on the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement benefits other than
pensions in 2005 and 2004 was approximately $10 million and $7 million,
respectively.

Estimated Future Cash Flow Impact

In 2006, Textron expects to contribute in the range
of $25 million to $30 million to fund its qualified pension plans and does not
expect to contribute to its other postretirement benefit plans. The benefit
payments provided below reflect expected future employee service, as
appropriate, that are expected to be paid, net of estimated participant
contributions. The benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to
measure Textron’s benefit obligation at the end of fiscal 2005. Pension benefit
payments will primarily be made out of qualified pension trusts. Postretirement
benefits other than pensions are paid out of Textron’s assets.


Note 15. Income Taxes

Textron files a consolidated federal income tax
return for all U.S. subsidiaries and separate returns for foreign subsidiaries.
Income from continuing operations before income taxes and distributions on
preferred securities of subsidiary trusts is as follows:

Income tax expense for continuing operations is
summarized as follows:

The following reconciles the federal statutory income
tax rate to the effective income tax rate reflected in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations:


The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise
to significant portions of Textron’s net deferred tax assets and liabilities
were as follows:

At December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005,
Textron had non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes
of $95 million and $94 million, respectively, of which $78 million and $82
million, respectively, can be carried forward indefinitely. The balance expires
at various dates through 2020. At January 1, 2005, Textron had U.S. net
operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of $64 million that were utilized
in 2005. At December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, Textron had
federal and state credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of $23 million
and $15 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal and state tax
credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2015.

A valuation allowance at December 31, 2005 and January 1,
2005 of $116 million and $125 million, respectively, has been recognized to
offset the related deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing the
benefits of the deferred tax assets. The decrease in the valuation allowance
was primarily related to deferred tax assets resulting from minimum pension
liability adjustments recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for certain
foreign jurisdictions and currency translation adjustments, partially offset by
a valuation allowance related to contingent receipts.

Textron’s income taxes payable for federal and state
purposes have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock options.
Textron receives an income tax benefit for certain stock options calculated as
the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of
exercise and the option price, tax effected. See Note 13 for the net tax
benefits to employee stock options.

The undistributed earnings of Textron’s foreign
subsidiaries on which tax is not provided, which approximated $530 million at
the end of 2005, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If the earnings
of foreign subsidiaries were distributed, taxes, net of foreign tax credits,
would be increased by approximately $111 million in 2005.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation
Act (“AJCA”) was signed into law and includes a deduction of 85% of certain
foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. During 2005,
Textron repatriated $435 million in cash from foreign subsidiaries under this
provision related to continuing operations. Tax expense of $0.9 million and $11
million was recognized in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to this
repatriation. In addition, Textron repatriated approximately $183 million in
cash related to its discontinued operations and recorded related tax expense of
$2 million in 2005.


Cash payments for taxes, net of tax refunds received,
for Textron Manufacturing excluding discontinued operations totaled $107
million in 2005, $(16) million in 2004 and $(38) million in 2003. Cash payments
for taxes, net of tax refunds, for discontinued operations totaled $(33)
million in 2005, $(16) million in 2004 and $(120) million in 2003. Cash
payments for taxes, net of tax refunds, for Textron Finance totaled $22 million
in 2005, $61 million in 2004 and $(6) million in 2003.

Note 16. Special Charges

Special charges are summarized below for the
applicable segments:

Restructuring Program

Textron substantially completed its company-wide
restructuring program at the end of 2005. Textron approved and committed to a
restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2000 to improve returns at core
businesses and to complete the integration of certain acquisitions. This
program was expanded in 2001 and in 2002 as part of Textron’s strategic effort
to improve operating efficiencies. Textron’s restructuring program included
corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions, consolidation
of facilities, rationalization of certain product lines, outsourcing of
non-core production activity, the divestiture of non-core businesses and the
streamlining of sales and administrative overhead. Under this program, Textron
reduced its workforce by approximately 8,000 employees from continuing
operations, representing approximately 19% of its global workforce since the
program was first announced, and has closed 85 facilities.

As of December 31, 2005, Textron had incurred
total program costs of $306 million, which is composed of $164 million in
severance costs, $44 million in contract termination costs, $34 million in
asset impairment charges (net of gains on the sale of fixed assets) and $64
million in other associated costs. Total program costs incurred by segment
include $219 million in the Industrial segment, $38 million in the Cessna
segment, $29 million in the Bell segment, $9 million in the Finance segment and
$11 million at Corporate.


An analysis of the restructuring program and related
reserve account is summarized below:

Severance costs are generally paid on a monthly basis
over the severance period granted to each employee or on a lump sum basis when
required. Severance costs include outplacement costs, which are paid in
accordance with normal payment terms. Contract termination costs are generally
paid upon exiting the facility or over the remaining lease term. Other
associated costs primarily include outsourcing certain operations, plant
rearrangement, machinery and equipment relocation, and employee replacement and
relocation costs, which are paid in accordance with normal payment terms.

Other Charges (Gain)

In connection with the disposition of Automotive Trim
to subsidiaries of Collins & Aikman Corporation (“C&A”), Textron
Finance has recourse to Textron Manufacturing for equipment leases with the
subsidiaries. The outstanding balance on these leases totaled approximately $70
million at December 31, 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the lease
term for these leases expired and C&A failed to make one of its lease
payments. While Textron Finance is currently in negotiations with C&A to
renew these leases, Textron Manufacturing recorded an additional reserve of $10
million in the fourth quarter of 2005 based on uncertainties related to these
leases. Consistent with other C&A-related charges and gains, Textron
recorded this charge in Special Charges.

In addition to the Textron Finance equipment leases,
certain operating leases were transferred and assigned to subsidiaries of
C&A upon the sale of Trim. As discussed in Note 18, Textron has guaranteed
C&A’s payments under these operating leases and certain environmental
matters. In May 2005, C&A and substantially all of its subsidiaries,
including C&A Products Co. (“C&A Products”), filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, and in July 2005, C&A’s European subsidiaries
filed a group-wide administration order in the United Kingdom. These filings
effectively reduced Textron’s ability to seek recourse from C&A under the
indemnity provisions of the purchase and sale agreement, should a default
occur. Based on C&A’s recent failure to pay certain leases, as well as the
negotiations entered into as part of the potential sale of C&A’s European
operations, Textron recorded $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 to cover
its exposure under these leases, along with certain environmental and workers’
compensation matters. Consistent with other C&A-related charges and gains,
Textron recorded this charge in Special Charges.

Textron also acquired preferred stock in C&A
Products and C&A common stock in connection with the Trim disposition. In March 2005,
Textron agreed to sell approximately 60 percent of its preferred stock in
C&A Products to Heartland Industrial Partners, L.P. (“Heartland”) for a combination
of cash and other consideration with a total value of approximately $25
million. Heartland also had the option to purchase the remaining preferred
shares for an aggregate price of $20 million. Textron recorded a pre-tax
impairment charge of approximately $52 million in the first quarter of 2005 to
write down the preferred shares to fair market value based on the value
determined by the agreement and other market considerations. With C&A
Products’ filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Heartland’s obligation
to purchase the preferred stock was effectively terminated. Based on relevant
market considerations, Textron recorded approximately $39 million in Special
Charges in the second quarter of 2005 to write off the remaining book value of
its investment in the preferred stock.


In 2004, Textron sold its remaining investment in
C&A common stock for cash proceeds of $34 million and recorded a pre-tax
gain of $12 million in Special Charges.

In 2003, Textron redeemed its 7.92% Junior
Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2045. The debentures were held
by Textron’s wholly owned trust, and the proceeds from their redemption were
used to redeem all of the $500 million Textron Capital I trust preferred
securities. Upon the redemption, $15 million of unamortized issuance costs were
written off and recorded in Special Charges.

Note 17. Commitments and
Contingencies

Textron is subject to legal proceedings and other
claims arising out of the conduct of Textron’s business, including proceedings
and claims relating to private sector transactions; government contracts;
production partners; product liability; employment; and environmental, safety,
and health matters. Some of these legal proceedings and claims seek damages,
fines or penalties in substantial amounts or remediation of environmental
contamination. Under federal government procurement regulations, certain claims
brought by the U.S. Government could result in Textron’s suspension or debarment
from U.S. Government contracting for a period of time. On the basis of
information presently available, Textron believes that these proceedings and
claims will not have a material effect on Textron’s financial position or
results of operations.

During 2002, the Lycoming aircraft engine business,
in conjunction with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), recalled
approximately 950 turbocharged airplane engines and mandated the inspection of
another 736 engines to replace potentially faulty crankshafts manufactured by a
former third-party supplier. Lycoming initiated a comprehensive customer care
program to replace the defective crankshafts, make any necessary related
repairs, and compensate its customers for the loss of use of their aircraft during
the recall. This program has been completed. Textron has continued to monitor
the performance of the crankshafts previously supplied by the former supplier
to ensure their continued suitability for their intended use and to ensure that
the existing reserves are adequate to cover the costs directly related to
potential crankshaft issues that may not specifically be a part of the prior
recall program. On July 11, 2005, Lycoming issued a service bulletin
covering certain non-turbocharged aircraft engines to replace crankshafts
manufactured by the former supplier with new FAA-certified crankshafts. The
service bulletin covers approximately 1,100 crankshafts and requires the
affected crankshafts to be replaced within the earlier of the next 50 hours of
operation or six months. An additional $5 million was accrued in the second
quarter of 2005 to increase existing reserves for this matter. In November,
this service bulletin was amended to include an additional 325 engines and an
additional $3 million was recorded.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, Lycoming developed
a plan to institute a retirement program for approximately 5,100 crankshafts,
representing the remaining crankshafts manufactured by the former supplier
using the same forging technique as the crankshafts covered by prior service
bulletins. This program is being discussed with the FAA and is expected to be
implemented in early 2006. There have been no accidents involving these
crankshafts, and they have not been the subject of a recall. An additional
reserve of $10 million was recorded in the fourth quarter to cover the expected
cost of this planned retirement program. As of December 31, 2005, reserves
to cover costs directly related to crankshafts provided by the former supplier
totaled $23 million.

In connection with the recall, the former supplier
filed a lawsuit against Lycoming claiming that the former supplier had been
wrongly blamed for aircraft engine failures resulting from its crankshaft
forging process and that Lycoming’s design was the cause of the engine
failures. In February 2005, a jury returned a verdict against Lycoming for
$86 million in punitive damages, $2.7 million in expert fees and $1.7 million
in increased insurance costs. The jury also found that the former supplier’s
claim that it had incurred $5.3 million in attorneys’ fees was reasonable.
Judgment was entered on the verdict on March 29, 2005, awarding the former
supplier $9.7 million in alleged compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees and
$86 million in alleged punitive damages. While the ultimate outcome of the
litigation cannot be assured, management strongly disagrees with the verdicts
and believes that it is probable that they will be reversed through the
appellate process.

Research and Development
Arrangements

As part of the realignment of Bell/Agusta Aerospace
Company LLC (“BAAC”) (see Note 19), Bell Helicopter, Agusta S.p.A. and two of
its affiliated companies (collectively, “Agusta”) have agreed to share certain
Model BA609 development costs. On behalf of BAAC, Agusta will incur development
costs to enhance its investment in BAAC. These development costs will be
recorded by Textron in consolidation as research and development expense, with
a credit to minority interest for Agusta’s share. Agusta may also make cash contributions
to reimburse portions of Bell Helicopter’s development costs incurred on behalf
of BAAC. Based on development costs incurred, Bell received $43 million in cash
contributions from Agusta, which were recorded in income in 2005.


During 2005, Bell Helicopter entered into four
separate risk-sharing arrangements. Two of the arrangements are with commercial
participants in the development of the Bell Model 429 aircraft. The
arrangements require contributions from the participants totaling $20 million,
which are due once the development effort reaches certain predetermined
milestones, as well as in-kind development contributions from one participant.
The other two arrangements are with Canadian governmental organizations. These
arrangements, which currently include the Model 429 aircraft and may
potentially include certain future aircraft, each require cash contributions of
up to CAD 115 million from the participants, based on a percentage of qualifying
research and development costs incurred.

Each of the participants under these arrangements is
entitled to payments from Bell Helicopter, with the commercial participants
also entitled to discounts, based on future sales of the Model 429 aircraft. In
addition, there are certain requirements related to production of future Model
429 aircraft in Canada, and one of the commercial participants is entitled to
perform certain manufacturing functions for the Model 429 aircraft. Based on
the development activities completed and costs incurred in the current and
prior periods through December 31, 2005, $35 million has been recorded in
income related to these arrangements.

Environmental Remediation

As with other industrial enterprises engaged in
similar businesses, Textron is involved in a number of remedial actions under
various federal and state laws and regulations relating to the environment that
impose liability on companies to clean up, or contribute to the cost of
cleaning up, sites on which hazardous wastes or materials were disposed or
released. Expenditures to evaluate and remediate contaminated sites
approximated $6 million in each of the three years ended December 31,
2005.

Textron’s accrued estimated environmental liabilities
are based upon currently available facts, existing technology and presently
enacted laws and regulations and are subject to a number of factors and
uncertainties. Accrued liabilities relate to disposal costs, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency oversight costs, legal fees, and operating and maintenance
costs for both currently and formerly owned or operated facilities.
Circumstances that can affect the reliability and precision of the accruals
include the identification of additional sites, environmental regulations,
level of cleanup required, technologies available, number and financial
condition of other contributors to remediation, and the time period over which
remediation may occur. Textron believes that any changes to the accruals that
may result from these factors and uncertainties will not have a material effect
on Textron’s financial position or results of operations. Based upon
information currently available, Textron estimates potential environmental
liabilities to be in the range of $44 million to $143 million. At the end of
2005, environmental reserves of approximately $66 million, of which $12 million
are classified as current liabilities, have been established to address these
specific estimated potential liabilities. Textron estimates that its accrued
environmental remediation liabilities will likely be paid over the next five to
ten years.

Note 18. Arrangements with
Off-Balance Sheet Risk

Textron enters into arrangements with off-balance
sheet risk in the normal course of business, as discussed below.

Guarantees

Textron has joint venture agreements with external
financing arrangements for which Textron has guaranteed approximately $15
million in debt obligations, including approximately $5 million related to
discontinued operations. Textron would be required to make payments under these
guarantees if a joint venture defaults under the debt agreements.

Bell Helicopter and AgustaWestland North America Inc.
(“AWNA”) formed the AgustaWestlandBell LLC (“AWB LLC”) in January 2004 for
the joint design, development, manufacture, sale, customer training and product
support of the US101 helicopter, recently designated the VH-71 helicopter, and
certain variations and derivatives thereof, to be offered and sold to
departments or agencies of the U.S. Government.

In March 2005, AWB LLC received a $1.2 billion
cost reimbursement-type subcontract from Lockheed Martin for the System
Development and Demonstration phase of the U.S. Marine Corps Marine 1
Helicopter Squadron (VH-71) Program. On March 11, 2005, Bell Helicopter
guaranteed to Lockheed Martin the due and prompt performance by AWB LLC of all
its obligations under this subcontract, provided that Bell Helicopter’s
liability under the guaranty shall not exceed 49% of AWB LLC’s aggregate
liability to Lockheed Martin under the subcontract. AgustaWestland N.V., AWNA’s
parent company, has guaranteed the remaining 51% to Lockheed Martin. Bell
Helicopter and AgustaWestland N.V. have entered into cross-indemnification
agreements in which each party indemnifies the other related to any payments
required under these agreements that result from the indemnifying party’s
workshare under any subcontracts received.


For 2005, AWB LLC’s maximum obligation is 20% of the
total contract value, which equates to $232 million based on the current
contract value of $1.2 billion. In 2006, AWB LLC’s maximum obligation increases
to 40%, or $464 million, and thereafter increases to 50%, or $580 million.
Accordingly, the maximum amount of Bell Helicopter’s liability under the
guarantee is $114 million at December 31, 2005 and will be $227 million in
2006 and $284 million thereafter through completion.

In the ordinary course of business, Textron enters
into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions,
principally to guarantee payment or performance to certain third parties in
accordance with specified terms and conditions. At December 31, 2005,
there were $155 million of standby letters of credit outstanding and $91
million of surety bonds outstanding. Management knows of no event of default
that would require Textron to satisfy these guarantees at the end of 2005.

Textron has a number of guaranteed minimum resale
value contracts associated with certain past aircraft sales. These guarantees
require Textron to make possible future payments to a customer in the event
that the fair value of an aircraft falls below a minimum guaranteed amount or
to stipulate a minimum trade-in value. The agreements generally include
operating restrictions such as maximum usage over the guarantee period or
minimum maintenance requirements. In addition, Textron has guaranteed the
minimum resale value of certain customer-owned aircraft anticipated to be
traded in upon completion of a model currently under development. Textron has
recorded a $3 million liability related to the estimated fair value of the
guarantee under these agreements. The total amount of resale value guaranteed
under these agreements at December 31, 2005 was approximately $31 million.
Based on the estimated fair values of the guaranteed aircraft prevailing at December 31,
2005, there was no additional liability related to Textron’s obligation under
these agreements. The guarantee contracts expire as follows: $3 million in
2006, $2 million in 2008, $3 million in 2009, $2 million in 2010, $2 million in
2011 and $19 million in 2012.

Textron Finance sells receivables in whole-loan sales
where limited credit enhancement is typically provided in the form of a
contingent liability related to finance receivable credit losses and, to a
lesser extent, prepayment risk. Textron Finance has a contingent liability
related to the sale of equipment lease rental streams in 2003 and 2001. The
maximum liability at December 31, 2005 was $42 million. Textron Finance
has valued this recourse liability based on assumptions for annual credit
losses and prepayment rates of 0.25% and 7.50%, respectively.

In connection with the sale of a note receivable in
2005, Textron Finance indemnified the purchaser against potential losses in
limited circumstances. The maximum potential exposure of the indemnity is
estimated to be $29 million, but due to the extremely low probability of
occurrence and several other mitigating factors, including a specific
indemnification from the original note issuer, no significant fair value has
been attributed to the indemnity.

In connection with the disposition of Trim, certain
operating leases were transferred and assigned to subsidiaries of C&A.
Textron has guaranteed C&A’s payments under these operating leases and an
environmental matter up to an aggregate remaining amount of approximately $24
million. Textron has an indemnification agreement with C&A for Textron’s
guarantee to a third party related to a specific environmental matter. As
discussed in Note 16, C&A’s filing for bankruptcy protection has
effectively reduced Textron’s ability to seek recourse from C&A under the
indemnity provisions of the purchase and sale agreement, should a default
occur. In the third quarter of 2005, Textron received a demand notice from the
third party related to the specific environmental matter. Textron will seek
indemnification from C&A for any amounts it is required to pay for this
matter. Textron is required to make payments under the other guarantees upon default
by C&A. Textron has not received any significant default notices related to
these leases, and management believes C&A will continue to make payments.
As part of C&A’s announced plan to sell its European operations, management
anticipates ongoing negotiations related to the guarantee of a leased European
facility. Management will continue to monitor C&A’s performance and Textron’s
reserves related to these matters. Textron has reserved $8 million based on
management’s best estimate of Textron’s exposure under these guarantees.

Leases

Rental expense approximated $89 million, $89 million
and $86 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Future minimum rental
commitments for noncancelable operating leases in effect at the end of 2005
approximated $57 million for 2006, $42 million for 2007, $33 million for 2008,
$30 million for 2009, $26 million for 2010 and a total of $120 million
thereafter.

Loan Commitments

At December 31, 2005, Textron Finance had unused
commitments to fund new and existing customers under $1.2 billion of committed
revolving lines of credit, compared with $1.0 billion at January 1, 2005.
Generally, interest rates on these commitments are not set until the loans are
funded so Textron Finance is not exposed to interest rate changes. Since many
of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire
unused, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash
requirements.


Note 19. Variable Interest Entities

BAAC is a joint venture established in 1998 between
Bell Helicopter and a predecessor of Agusta S.p.A. to share certain costs and
profits for the joint design, development, manufacture, marketing, sale,
customer training and product support of the civil tiltrotor Model BA609 and
until December 2005, the commercial helicopter Model AB139. This venture
is a variable interest entity since it relies on its partners to fund the
development and provide services for substantially all of the ventures’ operations.

On December 20, 2005, Bell Helicopter and Agusta
entered into a realignment of BAAC, which included the sale by Bell Helicopter
of its 25% profit interest in the Model AB139 medium twin helicopter program to
Agusta. Agusta assumed ownership of all aspects of the Model AB139 program from
BAAC, including all existing customer obligations. In exchange for its
interest, Bell Helicopter received $10 million in cash, a $20 million note and
a note for contingent payments from Agusta based on future Model AB139 sales.
Bell Helicopter recognized a $30 million pre-tax gain upon the sale of its
interest which is included in Segment Profit. The contingent receipts are
expected to begin with aircraft deliveries in 2008 and will be recorded into
income prospectively as the future sales occur.

In addition, the realignment allows Agusta to
increase its profit interest in the Model BA609 from the original 25% to a
maximum of 40% by increasing its investment during the development phase. These
development activities may include cash contributions to reimburse Bell
Helicopter for certain development costs incurred on behalf of BAAC (see Note
17). At year-end, Agusta’s profit interest was approximately 31%.

Prior to the realignment, only certain marketing and
administrative costs were charged to BAAC, while development costs were
recorded separately by the parties, with Bell Helicopter’s share of the
development costs charged to Textron’s earnings as a period expense. As a
result of the realignment, BAAC now includes only the Model BA609 tiltrotor,
and Bell Helicopter has a controlling voting interest in BAAC. Accordingly,
Bell Helicopter will absorb more than half of BAAC’s expected losses and
residual returns. As a result, Textron has consolidated BAAC prospectively as
of December 20, 2005.

Note 20. Supplemental Financial
Information

Accrued Liabilities

Textron Manufacturing’s accrued liabilities are
composed of the following:

Warranty and Product Maintenance
Contracts

Textron provides limited warranty and product
maintenance programs, including parts and labor, for certain products for
periods ranging from one to five years. Textron estimates the costs that may be
incurred under warranty programs and records a liability in the amount of such
costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect this
liability include the number of products sold, historical and anticipated rates
of warranty claims and cost per claim. Textron periodically assesses the
adequacy of its recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities and
adjusts the amounts as necessary.


Changes in Textron’s warranty and product maintenance
liability are as follows:

Research and Development Costs

Company-funded and customer-funded research and
development costs are as follows:

In 2005, $78 million in cost reimbursements of
company-funded amounts were received or due from risk-sharing partners,
resulting in net company-funded costs of $248 million. See Note 17 for
additional information concerning these risk-sharing arrangements.

Customer-funded research and development costs are
primarily related to U.S. Government contracts, including the V-22 and H-1
development contracts.

Note 21.

Segment Reporting and Geographic
Data

Textron has four reportable segments: Bell, Cessna,
Industrial and Finance. See Note 1 for the principal markets, and Item 1.
Business of Textron on pages 1 through 5 for products, of the segments.

Textron’s reportable segments are strategically
aligned based on the manner in which Textron manages its various operations.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note
1. Textron evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Segment
profit for Textron Manufacturing excludes interest expense, certain corporate
expenses, special charges, and gains and losses from the disposition of
significant business units. Textron Finance includes interest income and
expense and excludes special charges and, in 2003, included distributions on
preferred securities of the Finance subsidiary trust, as part of segment
profit. Provisions for losses on finance receivables involving the sale or
lease of Textron products are recorded by the selling manufacturing division
when Textron Finance has recourse to Textron Manufacturing.


* Includes capital expenditures
financed through capital leases

The following summarizes revenues by product type:

Revenues include sales to the U.S. Government of $1.8
billion in 2005, $1.3 billion in 2004 and $1.4 billion in 2003, primarily in
the Bell segment.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
–

We have carried out
an evaluation, under the supervision and the participation of our management,
including our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer (our “CEO”) and
our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (our “CFO”), of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”) as of the end of the
fiscal year covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
providing reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time


periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Controls –

On January 2, 2005, Textron engaged a
third-party service provider to assume operational control and day to day
management of Textron’s information technology infrastructure. During the
fourth quarter of 2005, Textron continued its transfer of operational control
and day to day management of its information technology infrastructure to the
third-party service provider. The third-party service provider has
responsibilities, under Textron’s oversight, for managing Textron’s networks
and help desks, and maintaining mainframes, midrange servers and workstations
located at both Textron and the third-party service provider locations. This
transfer has materially affected Textron’s internal control over financial
reporting related to its information technology infrastructure. We believe that
we have taken appropriate actions to ensure that effective internal controls
over financial reporting associated with the transfer have been and will
continue to be maintained during the transition period.
