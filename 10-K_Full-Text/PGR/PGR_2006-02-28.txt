INTRODUCTION

Portions of the information included in The Progressive Corporation’s Proxy Statement to be filed
on or about March 3, 2006, for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 21, 2006 (the
“Proxy Statement”) have been incorporated by reference herein and are identified under the
appropriate items in this Form 10-K. The 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders (the “Annual Report”)
of The Progressive Corporation and subsidiaries, which will be attached as an Appendix to the 2006
Proxy Statement, is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K. Cross references to relevant
sections of the Annual Report are included under the appropriate items of this Form 10-K.

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

(a) General Development of Business

The Progressive insurance organization began business in 1937. The Progressive Corporation, an
insurance holding company formed in 1965, currently has 70 subsidiaries and 1 mutual insurance
company affiliate. Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate provide personal automobile
insurance and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services throughout the
United States. Our property-casualty insurance products protect our customers against collision
and physical damage to their motor vehicles, uninsured and underinsured bodily injury, and
liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those
vehicles. Our non-insurance subsidiaries generally support our insurance and investment
operations.

(b) Financial Information About Segments

Incorporated by reference from Note 9,

Segment Information

, beginning on page App.-A-19 of
the Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

We offer a number of personal and commercial property-casualty insurance products primarily related
to motor vehicles. Net premiums written were $14.0 billion in 2005, compared to $13.4 billion in
2004 and $11.9 billion in 2003. Our combined ratio, calculated in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), was 88.1 in 2005, 85.1 in
2004 and 87.3 in 2003.

Organization

Auto insurance differs greatly by community because regulations and legal decisions vary by state
and because traffic, law enforcement, cultural attitudes, insurance agents, medical services and
auto repair services vary by community. Our organization enables us to meet varied local
conditions under a cohesive set of policies and procedures designed to provide consistency and
control. Our business is organized into four areas: Drive

®

Insurance from
Progressive (our agency brand which includes both personal and commercial auto), Progressive
Direct

SM

, Claims, and Sales and Service. Each business area has a Group
President and a management team. We entered New Jersey during 2005 and now write auto insurance
policies in 49 states (all but Massachusetts) and the District of Columbia. These 50 jurisdictions
are organized into regions, depending on business area. The Drive business is organized into Drive
Marketing and Drive Sales. In turn, each is organized into three geographical regions with General
Managers. The Direct business is organized into three geographical regions, with a General Manager
responsible for each region. The Claims business area has six General Managers responsible for one
region each. Sales and Service (which includes Drive and Direct customer service, Direct sales and
Claims loss reporting, among other services) is performed at locations in the following cities:
Austin, Texas; Cleveland, Ohio; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Phoenix, Arizona; Sacramento,
California; and Tampa, Florida.

Our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions and includes the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief
Information Officer and

- 2 -


Chief Human Resource Officer, as well as our four Group Presidents (Drive, Direct, Claims, and
Sales and Service). The Group Presidents are challenged to develop and manage product offerings and
customer service processes tailored to the unique requirements of customers who select either Drive
or Direct

insurance products, buying policies through the distribution channel of their
choice.

Personal Lines

Our Personal Lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreation and
other vehicles. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each
program targeted to a specific distribution channel, market or customer group. Personal Lines
accounted for 87% of total net premiums written in 2005, compared to 88% for both 2004 and 2003.
Our strategy is to become the low-cost provider of a full line of auto insurance products and
related services, distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers.

We ranked third in industry market share for 2004 based on net premiums written, and we believe
that we held this position for 2005. We compete with approximately 290 insurance companies/groups
that each writes over $5 million of private passenger auto insurance premiums annually in the
United States. The top 15 private passenger auto insurers comprised
about 75% of this
market. Our estimate of the 2005 industry net premiums written growth is 1.0%, based on actual
written premium growth through the first nine months of the year. For 2005, the estimated industry
net premiums written for personal auto insurance in the United States were $158.9 billion, and our
share of this market was approximately 7.7%, compared to $157.3 billion and 7.5%, respectively, in
2004, and $151.0 billion and 7.0% in 2003. Except as otherwise noted, all industry data and our
market share or ranking in the industry either were derived directly from data reported by A.M.
Best Company Inc. (“A.M. Best”) or were estimated using A.M. Best data as the primary source.

Private passenger automobile insurance is comprised of preferred, standard and nonstandard
automobile risks and represented 92% of total Personal Lines net premiums written by Progressive in
2005 and 2004, compared to 93% in 2003. We actively participate in the market for each of these
risks, with the objective of offering an accurate rate for every risk. Volume potential is driven
by our price competitiveness, brand recognition and the actions of our competitors, among other
factors. See “Competitive Factors” on page 5 of this report for further discussion.

Our specialty Personal Lines products include insurance for motorcycles, recreational vehicles,
mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles and similar items. These specialty products represented the
balance of our total Personal Lines net premiums written and are primarily distributed by
independent agents and brokers. Due to the nature of these products, we typically experience
higher losses during the warmer weather months. Our competitors are specialty companies and large
multi-line insurance carriers. Although industry figures are not available, based on our analysis
of this market, we believe that we are one of the largest participants in the specialty personal
lines market. Based on our review of the markets, we have determined
that we have been the market share leader for personal watercraft insurance since 2002
and for the motorcycle product since 1998.

The Personal Lines business is generated either through the Drive channel or written directly by us
through the Direct channel. The Drive channel includes business written by our network of more
than 30,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United States, as well as
brokerages in New York and California. These independent insurance agents and brokers have the
ability to place business with Progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed
underwriting guidelines, subject to compliance with certain company-mandated procedures. Our
guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates
that may be charged for specified categories of risk. The agents and brokers do not have authority
on behalf of Progressive to establish underwriting guidelines, develop rates, settle or adjust
claims, or enter into other transactions or commitments. The Drive channel also writes business
through strategic alliance business relationships with other insurance companies, financial
institutions, employers and national brokerage agencies. In 2005, the total net premiums written
through the Drive channel represented 66% of our Personal Lines volume, compared to 68% in 2004 and
69% in 2003.

- 3 -


The Direct channel includes business written directly by us over the phone at 1-800-PROGRESSIVE and
online at progressivedirect.com. Net premiums written in the Direct business were 34%,
32% and 31% of our Personal Lines volume in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Commercial Auto Business

The Commercial Auto business unit writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for
automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented 13% of our total net premiums
written in 2005, compared to 12% in 2004 and 11% in 2003. The majority of our Commercial Auto
customers insure three or fewer vehicles. Although the Commercial Auto business differs from
Personal Lines auto in its customer bases and products written, both businesses require the same
fundamental skills, including disciplined underwriting and pricing, as well as excellent claims
service. Our Commercial Auto products are distributed primarily through our Drive brand in the
independent agency channel. We compete on a nationwide basis with approximately 200 other
companies/groups, each with over $5 million of Commercial Auto premiums written annually. Our
Commercial Auto business ranked third in market share on a national basis in 2004 based on direct
written premiums, and we estimate that we retained that position for 2005.

Other-Indemnity Businesses

Our other-indemnity businesses, which represented less than 1% of our 2005 and 2004 net premiums
written, compared to 1% for 2003, include providing professional liability insurance to community banks,
principally directors and officers liability insurance. We reinsure the majority of the risk on
these coverages with a small mutual reinsurer controlled by its bank customers and various other
reinsurance entities. The program, sponsored by the American Bankers Association, insures over
1,600 banks, representing every state. In addition, our other-indemnity businesses include
managing the wind-down of our lender’s collateral protection program, which we ceased writing in
2003, and other run-off businesses.

Service Businesses

Our service businesses include providing insurance-related services, primarily providing policy
issuance and claims adjusting services in 25 states for Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans
(CAIP), which are state-supervised plans serving the involuntary markets. We process over 47% of
the premiums in the CAIP market and compete with two other providers nationwide. As a service
provider, we collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related
policies. We cede 100% of the premiums and losses to the plans. Reimbursements to us from the
CAIP plans are required by state laws and regulations. Material violations of contractual service
standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business. We have
maintained, and plan to continue to maintain, compliance with these standards. Any changes in our
participation as a CAIP service provider would not materially affect our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. The service businesses represented less than 1% of our 2005,
2004 and 2003 revenues.

Claims

We manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through more than 460 claims offices located
throughout the United States. In addition, we have in operation 26 centers, in 22 metropolitan
areas nationwide, that provide concierge-level claims service. These facilities are designed to
provide end-to-end resolution for auto physical damage losses.
Customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites
and can pick up a rental vehicle. Our representatives will then write
the estimate, select a qualified repair shop and inspect the vehicle
once the repairs are complete. This service reforms the vehicle
repair process, increases consumer satisfaction, increases our
productivity and improves the cycle time and quality of repairs.

In 2004, we achieved the
performance standards that had been established for the expansion of our concierge claims strategy
and, as a result, have announced a significant expansion of this service and are currently
researching, acquiring and constructing additional sites around the country. We expect to add
about 30 sites in 2006, including 18 currently under construction. We have also expanded this
concierge level of service by helping customers find and buy a replacement vehicle when their vehicle
is deemed a total loss. This service is being tested
in limited locations, but we expect expansion in 2006.

Competitive Factors

The automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets in which we operate are highly
competitive. Property-casualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price, consumer
recognition, coverages offered, claims handling, financial stability, customer service and
geographic coverage. Vigorous competition is provided by large, well-capitalized national
companies, some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents, and by
smaller regional insurers. We rely heavily on technology and
extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential. We have remained
competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills, closely managing
expenses and achieving operating efficiencies. Superior customer service, fair and accurate claims
adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy.

State Insurance Licenses

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance
authorities. These licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically, provided the
holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements. Our licenses govern the kinds of
insurance coverages that may be written by our subsidiaries in the issuing state. Such licenses
are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of
prescribed criteria. All licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good
standing.

Insurance Regulation

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by
insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact
business. At least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each
of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The nature and extent of such regulation and
supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, an insurance company is subject
to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile. Progressive’s insurance
subsidiaries and affiliate are domiciled in the states of Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan,
New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin. State insurance departments have broad
administrative power relating to licensing insurers and agents, regulating premium changes and
policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, prescribing statutory accounting methods and the
form and content of statutory financial reports, and regulating the type and amount of investments
permitted. Rate regulation varies from “use and file,” to “file and use,” to prior approval, to
mandated rates.

Insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies
maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards.
Insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the
insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business. Insurance departments
are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition
and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory
accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations.

Insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the
power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic
disclosure of certain information. These laws impose prior approval requirements for certain
transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and
other distributions, including loans and cash advances, between regulated insurers and their
affiliates. See the “Dividends” discussion in Item 5(c) for further information on
these dividend limitations.

Under state insolvency and guaranty laws, regulated insurers can be assessed or required to
contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of
other insurers. Insurers are also required by many states, as a condition of doing business in the
state, to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market. These
“assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage which must
be offered to such involuntary risks, as well as the allowable premium. Many states also have
involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to
involuntary risks. These plans, through assessments, pass underwriting and administrative expenses
on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states.

Insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus
to support their writings. Progressive is in the process of slowly increasing operating leverage
through a higher ratio of net premiums written to surplus in our insurance subsidiaries where
permitted. Although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function
of a number of factors (including applicable law, the type of business being written, the adequacy
of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets), the annual net

- 5 -


premiums that an insurer may write are generally limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s
total policyholders’ surplus (e.g., at year-end 2005, our premiums to surplus ratio was 3-to-1).
Thus, the amount of an insurer’s surplus, in certain cases, may limit its ability to grow its
business. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) also has developed a
risk-based capital (RBC) program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory
actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition. RBC is
a series of dynamic surplus-related formulas which contain a variety of factors that are applied to
financial balances based on a degree of certain risks, such as asset, credit and underwriting
risks.

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market. For
example, certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or non-renew policies.
Certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the
state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state
insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption.
Laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or non-renewal of policies, or that subject
program withdrawals to prior approval requirements, may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit
unprofitable markets or businesses.

Regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise.
Some changes may be due to economic developments, such as changes in investment laws made to
recognize new investment vehicles; other changes result from such general pressures as consumer
resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices
and solvency. In recent years, legislation and voter initiatives have been introduced, and in some
cases adopted, which deal with use of non-public consumer information, use of financial
responsibility and credit information in underwriting, insurance rate development, rate
determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew insurance policies, reflecting
concerns about consumer privacy, coverage, availability, prices and alleged discriminatory pricing.
In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies
investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation
is necessary.

In a number of states, Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit
information (credit) as part of the underwriting or rating process. This practice is expressly
authorized by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and our data demonstrates that credit
is an effective predictor of insurance risk. The use of credit in underwriting and rating is the
subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity. Regulators and legislators have
expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit, including: questions regarding the
accuracy of credit reports, perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and
certain minority groups, the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit
and insurance risk, the treatment of persons with limited or no credit, the impact on credit of
extraordinary life events (e.g., catastrophic injury or death of a spouse), and the credit
attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers. A number of state insurance
departments have issued bulletins, directives or regulations to regulate the use of credit by
insurers. In addition, a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate
insurers’ use of credit. Also, Congress recently mandated that the federal government conduct a
disparate impact study of the use of credit. It is possible that Congress may enact further
legislation affecting the use of credit in underwriting and rating following completion of that
study.

In some states, the automobile insurance industry has been under pressure in past years from
regulators, legislators or special interest groups to reduce, freeze or set rates to or at levels
that are not necessarily related to underlying costs, including initiatives to roll back automobile
and other personal lines rates. This kind of activity has affected adversely, and in the future
may affect adversely, the profitability and growth of our subsidiaries’ automobile insurance
business in those jurisdictions, and may limit the subsidiaries’ ability to increase rates to
compensate for increases in costs. Adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the
subsidiaries’ ability to price automobile insurance adequately, or affecting the subsidiaries’
insurance operations adversely in other ways, may occur in the future. The impact of these
regulatory changes on the subsidiaries’ businesses cannot be predicted.

Statutory Accounting Principles

Our results are reported in accordance with GAAP, which differ in certain respects from amounts
reported under statutory accounting principles (SAP) prescribed by insurance regulatory
authorities. Primarily, under GAAP:

Investments

We employ a conservative approach to investment and capital management intended to ensure that we
have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premium that we can profitably write. Our
portfolio is invested primarily in short-term and intermediate-term, investment-grade fixed-income
securities. Our investment portfolio had a market value of $14.3 billion at December 31, 2005,
compared to $13.1 billion at December 31, 2004. Investment income is affected by the variability
of cash flows to or from the portfolio, shifts in the type and quality of investments in the
portfolio, changes in yield and other factors. Investment income, including net realized gains
(losses) on securities, before expenses and taxes, was $498.8 million in 2005, compared to $563.7
million in 2004 and $478.0 million in 2003. For more detailed discussion, see

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

The consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss
adjustment expenses (LAE) of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries. Our objective is to ensure that
total reserves (i.e., case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves-“IBNR”) are adequate to
cover all loss costs, while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially
established until losses are fully developed. The liabilities for losses and LAE are determined
using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net
cost of all unpaid losses and LAE incurred through December 31 of each year. These estimates are
subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement, among other factors. These estimates
are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.
Such adjustments, if any, are reflected in the current results of operations. A detailed
discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “Report on Loss Reserving
Practices,” which was filed with the SEC on Form 8-K on June 28, 2005. The accompanying tables
present an analysis of property-casualty losses and LAE.

The following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances
for 2005, 2004 and 2003 on a GAAP basis.

During 2005 and 2004, we experienced $355.9 million, $109.1 million and $56.1 million,
respectively, of favorable loss reserve development. The favorable development during 2005 and
2004 was driven by actuarial adjustments, resulting from regularly scheduled actuarial reviews, as
well as favorable “all other development” (e.g., claims settling for more or less than reserved,
emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than reserved and changes in reserve estimates by
claims representatives). The favorable “all other development” also reflected the continued
recognition of lower severity for prior accident years than had been previously
estimated. In addition to favorable claims development during 2003, we benefited from a
change in our estimate of our future operating losses due to business assigned from the New York
Automobile Insurance Plan. We conduct extensive reviews each month on portions of our business to
help ensure that we are meeting our objective of having reserves that are adequate, with minimal
variation.

In establishing loss reserves, we take into account the projected change in average severities of
claims, which is caused by the anticipated effect of inflation and a number of factors that vary
with the individual type of policy written. Future average severities are projected based on
historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards, inflation, policy
provisions and general economic trends. These anticipated trends are monitored based on actual
development and are modified if necessary.

We have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material
effect on earnings or reserves.

Represents loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses
at the balance sheet date.


Cumulative development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and LAE — Net.

- 9 -


The above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and LAE from
1995 through 2004. The top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and
LAE recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the property-casualty
insurance subsidiaries only. This liability represents the estimated amount of losses and LAE for
claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date, including IBNR. The table also presents the
re-estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE on a gross basis, with separate disclosure of the
re-estimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses.

The upper section of the table (labeled “Paid (Cumulative) as of:”) shows the cumulative amount
paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year. The
lower portion of the table (labeled “Liability Re-estimated as of:”) shows the re-estimated amount
of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year.
The estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for
individual years. For example, as of December 31, 2005, our insurance subsidiaries had paid
$1,417.9 million of the currently estimated $1,443.2 million of losses and LAE that had been
incurred through the end of 1996; thus, an estimated $25.3 million of losses incurred through 1996
remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date.

The cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years.
For example, the 1995 liability has developed favorably by $167.5 million over ten years. That
amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and did not have a significant effect on the
income of any one year. The effects on income during the past three years due to changes in
estimates of the liabilities for losses and LAE are shown in the reconciliation table on page 8 as
the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and LAE.

In evaluating this information, note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects
of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods. For example, the amount of
the development related to losses settled in 1998, but incurred in 1995, will be included in the
cumulative development amount for years 1995, 1996 and 1997. Conditions and trends that have
affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future.
Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table.

We
experienced continually favorable reserve development from 1995 through 1998 primarily due to
decreasing bodily injury severity. The reserves established as of the end of each year assumed the
current accident year’s severity would increase over the prior
accident year’s estimate. From 1995 continuously through the third quarter 1998, our bodily injury severity decreased
each quarter when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. This period of decreasing
severity for us was not only longer than that experienced by the industry, but also longer than at
any time in our recent history. As the experience continued to be evaluated at later dates, the
realization of the decreased severity resulted in favorable reserve development. Late in 1998, we
started experiencing an increase in bodily injury severity. As a result, the reserve development
for 1998 through 2001 has been much closer to our original estimate.
Thereafter, we recognized lower severity than what we expected when
reserves were originally set.

The Analysis of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Development table on page 9 is constructed from
Schedule P, Part-1, from the Consolidated Annual Statements of Progressive’s insurance
subsidiaries, as filed with the state insurance departments.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in
this section. Management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may
affect the ability to achieve our business objectives:

•

Operating Risks

are those stemming from external or internal events or circumstances
that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations.

•

Investing Risks

are uncertainties relating to the performance and preservation of our
investment portfolios. Unlike most other risks, the actual development of an investment
risk factor (such as whether interest rates go down or up) may result in either an increase
or decrease in the value of investments we hold.

•

Financing Risks

generally relate to our ability to obtain capital, when necessary, to
pay or otherwise perform our obligations, including obligations under any debt instruments
issued, and to earn the cost of equity capital.

Although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below,
it should be noted that many of the risks have ramifications in more than one category. For
example, although presented as an Operating Risk below, state regulation of insurance companies may
also affect our investing and financing activities. Similarly, while setting insurance rates,
setting loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as Operating Risks, errors in
these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well. The categories,
therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us
and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed.

This information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in
this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the SEC, as well as news
releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional
risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may
also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into
actual events, this could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations. In that case, the market price of our Common Shares could decline
materially.

I.

Operating Risks

We compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly
competitive.

We face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national companies and smaller regional
insurers. Other large national and international insurance or financial services companies may
also enter these markets in the future. Many of these companies may have greater financial,
marketing and management resources than we have. In addition, competitors may offer consumers
combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services which we do not
offer. We could be adversely affected by a loss of business to competitors offering similar
insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor
initiatives.

From time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive
position in auto insurance markets. Based on a culture that encourages innovation, these
strategies at times involve significant departures from our and/or our competitors’ then-current or
historical modes of doing business. As such, our innovations may entail a degree of risk and may
not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals. In addition, these initiatives may be subject
to challenge by regulators or private litigants and may disrupt our relationships with certain of
our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). If we are unable successfully to develop,

- 11 -


plan and implement our strategic initiatives in these competitive, regulatory and legal
environments, our business could be materially adversely affected.

Similarly, we undertake distinctive advertising campaigns and other efforts to improve brand
recognition and generate growth. If these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less
effective than those of competitors, our business could be materially adversely affected.

The highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure
of one or more major competitors. In the event of a failure of a major insurer, we could be
adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under
state-mandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer, and we could be faced with an
unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders.

Our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers and executives, and to
maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success.

Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, including
executives and other key managers. Our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure
to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect
on our business.

In addition, we must forecast the changing business environments (for multiple business units and
in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring programs and/or
employment levels accordingly. Our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our
failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing
(which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing our ability to
service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. In either such
event, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.

We further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve
the staffing models and employee culture that it has developed over the years. Our ability to do
so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, legislation or regulations at the state or
federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace. In such events, the productivity of
certain of our workers could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating
performance and margins.

Progressive and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state
laws and regulations.

Progressive’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. Our insurance
subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50
states and the District of Columbia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and
regulations. In addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses,
including insurers. Our subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations at
reasonable costs, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will
continue to be critical to our success.

Certain states impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by
regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate,
innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. Our compliance efforts are
further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies (such as,
in recent years, legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer
information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to
freeze, set or roll back insurance premium rates). Insurance laws and regulations may limit the
insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent the subsidiaries
from obtaining timely rate increases necessary to cover increased costs, restrict the subsidiaries’
ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets or prevent insurers
from terminating policies under certain circumstances. In addition, compliance with
insurance-related laws and regulations often results in increased administrative costs to our
insurance subsidiaries. These costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our
ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions.

- 12 -


The failure to comply with these laws and regulations also could result in actions by regulators or
other law enforcement officials, potentially leading to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and
damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary’s
authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, Progressive and its
subsidiaries can face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for
alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations.

During 2005, we received document and information requests from several state attorneys general and
insurance regulators regarding ongoing investigations into the relationships between insurers and
brokers and agents, allegations of bid-rigging by certain brokers and other related matters. For a
discussion of our responses to these requests, see the “Financial Condition – Commitments and
Contingencies” Section in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations in the Annual Report, which is attached as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

New legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our
operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states. In addition, from time
to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition
of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. We are unable to
predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations
would affect our businesses.

State insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for the Progressive’s insurance
subsidiaries in other ways as well. For further information on these risks and uncertainties, see
the “Insurance Regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report.

Lawsuits challenging our business practices, our competitors and other companies are pending and
more may be filed in the future.

The Progressive Corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of putative
class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business
operations. These lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of the use of after-market
parts; total loss evaluation methodology; the use of credit in underwriting and related
requirements under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act; methods used for evaluating and paying
certain bodily injury, personal injury protection and medical payment claims; and policy
implementation and renewal procedures, among other matters. From time to time, we also may be
involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our business practices or systems violate
the patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Additional
litigation may be filed against Progressive and/or its subsidiaries or disputes may arise in the
future concerning these or other business practices. In addition, lawsuits have been filed, and
other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and
although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional
risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, the subsidiaries’ business
operations.

Lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. Moreover, as courts resolve
individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields, a new layer of court-imposed
regulation could emerge, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. Such
litigation is inherently unpredictable. Except to the extent we have established reserves with
respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the
effect, if any, that these pending or future lawsuits may have on our business, operations,
profitability or financial condition. For further information on pending litigation, see Note 11,
Litigation, beginning on page App.-A-21 of the Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to
this Form 10-K.

Our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to
policyholders.

Our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite
and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. The role of the pricing function is to
ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses, loss adjustment
expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit.

Our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:

•

the availability of sufficient reliable data,

- 13 -


The realization of such risks may result in our pricing being based on stale, inadequate or
inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions or methodologies, and may cause us to
estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, we could
underprice risks, which would negatively affect our margins, or we could overprice risks, which
could reduce our volume and competitiveness. In either event, our operating results, financial
condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Our financial performance may also be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or
other catastrophic losses.

We continue to be exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes, as shown
by the active hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005. Catastrophes can be caused by natural events,
such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and
fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, hazardous material releases,
medical epidemics, utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities. The extent of
insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area
affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. In addition, our business could be
further impaired if a significant portion of our business or systems were shut down by, or if we
were unable to gain access to certain of our facilities as a result of, such an event. Most of our
past catastrophe-related claims have resulted from severe storms. The incidence and severity of
catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. When they occur with enough severity, our financial
performance, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims
accurately.

Our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts
that the subsidiaries will ultimately pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs
of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. There is inherent
uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves, which can arise
from a number of factors, including:

- 14 -


As a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment
expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and
expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. Consequently,
ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on
our results of operations, liquidity or financial position. Further information on our loss
reserves can be found in the “Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses”
discussion beginning on page 8 of this report, as well as our “Report on Loss Reserving Practices,”
which was filed with the SEC on Form 8-K on June 28, 2005.

Likewise, we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many
factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training and experience of
our claims representatives, the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of our
management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to
support our claims functions and the success of our concierge-level claims services program. Our
failure to pay claims accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material
litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand
image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our financial results, prospects and liquidity.

Our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business
functions, including our information technology and other business systems.

Our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform, in an efficient and
uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as Internet support and 24-hour call
centers, processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims. A shut-down of or
inability to access one or more of our facilities, a power outage, or a failure of one or more of
our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our
ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. In addition, because our information
technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we
could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party
system fails or experiences an interruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business
interruption, system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to
write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner
or perform other necessary business functions. This could result in a materially adverse effect on
our business results, prospects and liquidity.

A security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations or harm our
reputation. In addition, we could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is
misappropriated from our computer systems. Despite the implementation of security measures,
including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer
systems, these systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming
errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. Any compromise of security could
deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to
our systems, which could have a material, adverse effect on our business.

II.

Investing Risks

The performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to investment
risks.

Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including:

•

Interest rate risk

– the risk of adverse changes in the value of
fixed-income securities as a result of increases in the underlying
market rates, which is the most significant risk to the
fixed-income portfolio.

•

Credit risk

– the risk that the value of certain investments may
become impaired due to the deterioration in financial condition of
one or more issuers of those instruments and, ultimately, the risk
of permanent loss in the event of default by an issuer.

•

Concentration risk

– the risk that the portfolio may be too
heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers,
sectors or industries, which could result in a significant
decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a
deterioration of the financial condition of those issuers or the
market value of their securities.

•

Prepayment or extension risk

(applicable to certain securities in
the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) –
the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such
securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, adversely
affecting the value of or income from such securities and the
portfolio.

- 15 -


The common equity portfolio, which is managed to track the Russell 1000 index, is subject to
general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the
securities we hold. Equity markets and individual securities may be subject to periods of high
volatility. A decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be
expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio.

In addition, both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are subject to risks inherent
in the nation’s and world’s capital markets. The functioning of those markets, the values of the
investments we hold and our ability to liquidate investments on favorable terms on short notice may
be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by local, national or
international events, such as power outages, system failures, wars or terrorist attacks, recessions
or depressions, a significant change in inflation expectations, a significant devaluation of
governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events.

If the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to be impaired by market, sector or
issuer-specific conditions to a substantial degree, our liquidity, financial position and financial
results could be materially adversely affected. Under these circumstances, our income from these
investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could
further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. A decrease in value of an insurance
company’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy
regulatory minimum capital requirements. If we at that time are unable to supplement the
subsidiary’s capital from The Progressive Corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity
securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected.

III.

Financing Risks

Our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the
holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to
shareholders, repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or
affiliates.

The Progressive Corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own.
Consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to The
Progressive Corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, Progressive may be unable to pay
dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations,
repurchase its Common Shares, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries
or affiliates. Each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be
limited by one or more of the following factors:

•

State insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory
capital and surplus.

•

Competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings.

•

In certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from state regulatory authorities for the insurance
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the holding company.

Further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our
insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in Item 5(c), “Dividends,” on page 19 of this
report.

Our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into
significant contracts becomes insolvent or experiences other financial hardship.

Our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under
various contractual relationships, including without limitation, contracts for the acquisitions of
goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support,
and other services that are integral to our operations) and arrangements for transferring certain
of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products
and our corporate insurance policies). If one or more of these parties were to default on the
performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or
terminate support for a system, product or service that is significant to our business, we could
suffer significant financial losses and operational problems, which could in turn adversely affect
our financial performance, cash flows or results of operations.

- 16 -


Our access to capital markets, our financing arrangements and our business operations are dependent
on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies.

Our credit strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor’s
and Moody’s Investors Service. In addition, the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries
is rated by A.M. Best. Progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable,
stable ratings. Downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the
capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates
we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected). Perceptions of our company by
investors, producers, other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired.
Downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our
operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. In either event, our
financial performance could be materially adversely affected.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

We currently do not have any unresolved comments from the SEC staff.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters are located on a 42-acre parcel in Mayfield Village, Ohio. We
also own a 72-acre corporate office complex near the headquarters. Buildings on these two sites
contain approximately 1.6 million square feet of office space.

We also own: seven other buildings in Cleveland, Ohio suburbs near the corporate office complexes;
seven buildings in Tampa, Florida; three buildings in Colorado Springs, Colorado; and a building in
each of the following cities: Albany, New York; Ft. Lauderdale, Florida; Plymouth Meeting,
Pennsylvania; Tempe, Arizona; and Tigard, Oregon. Two of these buildings are partially leased to
non-affiliates. In total, these buildings contain approximately 1.9 million square feet of office,
warehouse and training facility space. These facilities are occupied by our business units or
other supporting operations and are not segregated by industry segment.

The building in Tempe, Arizona is also partially used as a claims service center. In addition, we
own 4 buildings and lease another 21 to provide concierge-level claims service at various locations
throughout the United States. In total, these additional buildings contain approximately .4 million
square feet. We also have 18 claims service centers currently under
construction and are acquiring additional properties in various
markets around the country as part of our announced expansion of the
program.

We lease approximately 1.2 million square feet of office and warehouse space at various locations
throughout the United States for our business units and corporate functions. In addition, we lease
approximately 460 claims offices, consisting of approximately 3.4 million square feet, at various
locations throughout the United States. These leases are generally short-term to medium-term
leases of standard commercial office space.

(c) Dividends

See the table above for the frequency and amount of cash dividends paid on our Common Shares, $1.00
par value, for the last two years.

On February 26, 2006, Progressive’s Board of Directors approved a change in our dividend policy,
which is expected to be implemented in 2007. This change is described in

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, beginning on page
App.-A-26 of the Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, and in the

Letter to Shareholders

, which is included in our 2005 Summary Annual Report and filed as Exhibit
99(A) in this Form 10-K. In addition, a Question and Answer document on the new dividend policy is
filed as Exhibit 99(B) to this Form 10-K.

Consolidated statutory policyholders’ surplus was $4.7 billion at both December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. At December 31, 2005, $505.7 million of consolidated statutory policyholders’
surplus represented net admitted assets of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate that
are required to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements in such entities’ states of domicile.
The companies may be licensed in states other than their states of domicile, which may have higher
minimum statutory surplus requirements. Generally, the net admitted assets of insurance companies
that, subject to other applicable insurance laws and regulations, are available for transfer to the
parent company cannot include the net admitted assets required to meet the minimum statutory
surplus requirements of the states where the companies are licensed. Based on the dividend laws
currently in effect, the insurance subsidiaries may pay aggregate dividends of $1.1 billion in 2006
without prior approval from regulatory

- 19 -


authorities, provided the dividend payments are not within 12 months of previous dividends paid by
the applicable subsidiary.
