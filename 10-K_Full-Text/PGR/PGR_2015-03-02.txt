PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

(a) General Development of Business

The Progressive insurance organization began business in 1937. The Progressive Corporation, an insurance holding company formed in 1965, currently has 53 subsidiaries, one mutual insurance company affiliate, and one limited partnership investment affiliate. Our insurance subsidiaries and mutual insurance company affiliate provide personal auto insurance, commercial auto and truck insurance principally for small businesses, and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services. Our property-casualty insurance products protect our customers against losses due to collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles, uninsured and underinsured bodily injury, and liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those vehicles. Our non-insurance subsidiaries and limited partnership investment affiliate generally support our insurance and investment operations. We operate our businesses throughout the United States and sell personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance on an Internet-only basis in Australia.

In December 2014, we signed a purchase agreement to acquire a controlling interest in ARX Holding Corp. (ARX), the parent company of American Strategic Insurance Corp. (ASI) and its affiliates,  our current provider of homeowners insurance in the Agency channel (see

Narrative Description of Business-Pending Acquisition

Organization

Auto insurance differs greatly by community because legal requirements and decisions vary by state and because, among other factors, traffic, law enforcement, cultural attitudes, insurance agents, medical services, and auto repair services vary by community. We are organized as follows:

•

Personal Lines

– A Group President manages our Personal Lines business, which includes insurance for personal autos and special lines products (e.g., motorcycles, ATVs, RVs, mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles, and similar items):

•

We currently write personal auto insurance in all 50 of the United States, the District of Columbia, and on an Internet-only basis in Australia. Our personal auto management group is organized by state into four geographic regions in the United States, plus a region for Australia. Each region is led by a general manager. We also have a separate manager for our California Agency organization.

•

We write the majority of our special lines products in all 50 states. Our special lines management group is organized by product and led by a general manager.

•

Commercial Lines

– A Group President manages our Commercial Lines business, which offers products in 49 states; we do not currently write Commercial Lines in Hawaii or the District of Columbia. The Commercial Lines business is organized by state, with product managers responsible for local implementation. These state-level managers are led by two regional directors who report to a general manager.

•

Customer Operations

– Our President of Customer Operations manages our claims and customer relations business functions.

▪

Claims

-

A Claims Operations Leader manages our claims business function, which is organized into four groups. Three of the groups are organized by geographic region, and one is a countrywide group that provides various claims-related services, including catastrophe response and special investigations. Each group is headed by a general manager, and each handles both Personal Lines and Commercial Lines claims.

▪

Customer Relations

- Our customer relations groups conduct direct sales and support our policy

servicing, agency distribution, claims, and direct sales operations.

- 2 -

Our executive management team sets policies and makes key strategic decisions. This team includes the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer, and Chief Marketing Officer, as well as our three Presidents (discussed above). The Presidents are responsible for the development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance products.

Personal Lines

Our Personal Lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel, market, or customer group. The Personal Lines business accounted for approximately 90% of total net premiums written during each of the last three years. Our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full line of auto insurance products with distinctive service, distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers. Volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness, brand recognition, service quality, and the actions of our competitors, among other factors. See “Competitive Factors” below for further discussion.

The Personal Lines segment consists of our personal auto insurance products, as well as our special lines products.

•

Personal auto insurance

represented approximately 90% of our total Personal Lines net premiums written for each of the last three years. This business includes Snapshot

®

, our usage-based insurance program, which is available to consumers through both the Agency and Direct channels in 45 states and the District of Columbia. During 2014, we wrote over $2.6 billion of premium with customers who are part of our Snapshot program.

We ranked fourth in market share in the U.S. private passenger auto market for


based on net premiums written and believe that we held that position for


. There are approximately 310 competitors in this market. Progressive and the other leading 14 private passenger auto insurers, each of which writes over $2.0 billion of premiums, comprise about 75% of this market. For


, the industry net premiums written for private passenger auto insurance in the United States was $174.5 billion, and our share of this market was approximately 8.7%, compared to $168.0 billion and 8.5% in


, respectively; comparable industry data is not available for


at this time. All industry data, including ranking and market share, was obtained directly from data reported by either SNL Financial or A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”), or was estimated using A.M. Best data as the primary source.

•

Special lines products

include insurance for motorcycles, ATVs, RVs, mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles, and similar items, and represented about 10% of our Personal Lines business. Due to the nature of these products, we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months. Our competitors are specialty companies and large multi-line insurance carriers. Although industry figures are not available, based on our analysis of this market, we believe that we are one of the largest providers of these products, and that we have been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since 1998. As of December 31, 2014, we offered a personal umbrella insurance product in 37 states and the District of Columbia through certain independent agents and to Direct customers via telephone. We also offered a renters insurance product in three states through certain independent agents as of December 31, 2014; we intend to roll out this product to additional states and agents as part of our bundling strategy.

- 3 -

Our Personal Lines products are sold through both the Agency and Direct channels.

•

The Agency business

includes business written by our network of more than 35,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United States, including brokerages in New York and California. T

hese independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place business with Progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines, subject to compliance with company-mandated procedures. Our guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be charged for

specified

categories of risk. The agents and brokers do not have authority on behalf of Progressive to establish underwriting guidelines, develop rates, settle or adjust claims, or enter into other transactions or commitments. The Agency business also writes insurance through strategic alliance business relationships with other insurance companies, financial institutions, and national agencies. The total net premiums written through the Agency business represented 54% of our Personal Lines volume in


, compared to 56% in both


and


.

•

The Direct business

includes business written directly by us on the Internet, through mobile devices, and over the phone. The Direct business represented 46% of our Personal Lines volume in


, compared to 44% in both


and


.

In our Personal Lines segment, we are also continuing with our efforts to further penetrate customer households through cross-selling auto policies with our special lines products and vice versa, as well as through Progressive Home Advantage

®

(PHA). PHA is the program in which we “bundle” our auto product with property insurance provided by unaffiliated insurance carriers. Bundled products are an integral part of our consumer offerings and an important part of our strategic agenda. As of December 31, 2014, PHA was available to Direct customers in 49 states, Agency customers in 26 states, including three states added during 2014, and to both Direct and Agency customers in the District of Columbia. PHA is available to Agency customers in Florida and, in 2014, was made available to Direct customers in that state. PHA is not yet available to customers in Alaska. In the Direct channel, PHA is provided by 12 unaffiliated insurance carriers. In the Agency channel, ASI will be our exclusive provider of homeowners products for new business (see "Pending Acquisition" below for further discussion).

Commercial Lines

The Commercial Lines business writes primary liability, physical damage, and other auto-related insurance for automobiles and trucks owned and/or operated predominately by small businesses as a part of the commercial auto market. This business represented approximately 10% of our total net premiums written during each of the last three years. Our Commercial Lines customers on average insure approximately two vehicles. Even though we continue to write over 90% of our Commercial Lines business through the Agency channel, net premiums written through the Direct channel increased by 13% in 2014. The Commercial Lines business operates in the following business market targets:

•

Business auto

– autos, vans, and pick-up trucks used by small businesses, such as retailing, farming, services, and private trucking,

•

For-hire transportation

– tractors, trailers, and straight trucks primarily used by regional general freight and expeditor-type businesses and non-fleet long-haul operators,

•

Contractor

– vans, pick-up trucks, and dump trucks used by small businesses, such as artisans, heavy construction, and landscapers/snowplowers,

•

For-hire specialty

– dump trucks, log trucks, and garbage trucks used by dirt, sand and gravel, logging, and coal-type businesses,

•

Tow

– tow trucks and wreckers used in towing services and gas/service station businesses, and

•

For-hire livery

– non-fleet (i.e., five or fewer vehicles) taxis, black-car services, and airport taxis

.

Business auto is our largest business market target, measured by premium volume, and accounts for approximately one third of our total Commercial Lines premiums, while the for-hire transportation and contractor business market targets each account for about another 25%. Business auto and contractor together account for approximately 75% of the vehicles we insure in this business, while for-hire transportation accounts for about 10%. Although Commercial Lines differs from Personal Lines auto in its customer base and products written, both businesses require the same fundamental skills, including disciplined underwriting and pricing, as well as excellent claims service.

There are approximately 340 competitors in the total U.S. commercial auto market. We primarily compete with about 37 other large companies/groups, each with over $150 million of commercial auto premiums written annually. These leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75% of this market. Our Commercial Lines business ranked second in the commercial auto insurance market for


based on net premiums written; we estimate this business to be ranked in the top two for 2014.

- 4 -

Other Indemnity

Our other indemnity businesses consist of managing our run-off businesses, including the run-off of our professional liability business, which was sold in 2010. Pursuant to our agreement with the purchaser of this business, from the date of sale through April 30, 2012, we continued to write these policies, principally directors and officers liability insurance for community banks. All professional liability insurance policies written in July 2010 and later were 100% reinsured. From August 2009 through June 2010, the substantial majority of the risks on this business were 100% reinsured and prior to August 2009, a majority of the risks on this business were reinsured. We have only 15 policies in force as of December 31, 2014.

Pending Acquisition

In December 2014, we signed a purchase agreement to acquire a controlling interest in ARX, the parent company of ASI and its affiliates. ASI, one of the 20 largest homeowners carriers in the United States, specializes in personal and commercial property insurance, personal umbrella insurance, and primary and excess flood insurance.  After closing, we expect that ASI will continue to be the exclusive provider of homeowners products for new business in our Agency channel.

The transaction is expected to close in April 2015, subject to closing conditions, at an estimated cost of $875 million.  If the transaction closes, we expect that Progressive and the other continuing ARX shareholders and stock option holders will enter into a new stockholders’ agreement to address the parties’ respective rights and obligations after the closing. Among other provisions, the stockholders’ agreement will provide the non-Progressive shareholders with rights to put all of their shares to Progressive in two installments, one in early 2018 and one in early 2021. Progressive likewise will have the right to call shares from the other ARX shareholders in each of 2018 and 2021. If these rights are exercised in full when available, Progressive’s ownership stake in ARX capital stock would exceed 80% in 2018, and Progressive would acquire all of the remaining capital stock of ARX in 2021. The purchase prices for shares to be purchased by Progressive pursuant to these put or call rights will be determined by adding (A) the price per share paid in the closing currently expected in April 2015, to (B) the product of the change in the per share net tangible book value of ARX between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2017 (for the 2018 put or call purchases) or December 31, 2020 (for the 2021 put or call purchases) times a multiple of between 1.0 and 2.0. The multiple will be determined based on the growth and profitability of ARX’s business over the applicable time period, pursuant to criteria to be included in the stockholders’ agreement.

Service Businesses

Our service businesses, which represent less than 1% of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our overall operations, primarily include:

•

Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans (CAIP)

– We are the only servicing carrier on a nationwide basis for CAIP plans, which are state-supervised plans servicing the involuntary market in 42 states and the District of Columbia. As a service provider, we provide policy issuance and claims adjusting services and collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related policies. We have an agreement with AIPSO (the national organization responsible for administering the involuntary insurance market) under which we will receive a supplemental fee, when necessary, to satisfy a minimum servicing fee requirement; this agreement is scheduled to expire on August 31, 2018. We cede 100% of the premiums and losses to the plans. Reimbursements to us from the CAIP plans are required by state laws and regulations. Material violations of contractual service standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business. We have maintained, and plan to continue to maintain, compliance with these standards. Any changes in our participation as a CAIP service provider would not materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

•

Commission-based businesses

– We have two commission-based service businesses:

In our Direct business, through Progressive Home Advantage

®

, we offer home, condominium, and renters insurance, among other products, written by unaffiliated insurance companies. We receive commissions for policies written under this program, all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program. Progressive Home Advantage is not currently available to customers in Alaska.

Through Progressive Commercial Advantage

SM

, we offer our customers the ability to package their auto coverage with other commercial coverages that are written by unaffiliated insurance companies or placed with additional companies through unaffiliated insurance agencies. This program offers general liability and business owners policies throughout the continental United States and workers’ compensation coverage in 44 states as of December 31, 2014. We receive commissions for the policies written under this program, all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program.

- 5 -

Claims

We manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 270 claims offices located throughout the United States. We have in operation 67 Service Centers in 51 metropolitan areas across the country, of which 44 have combined claims offices and Service Centers to improve our efficiency and manage costs. Insureds and other claimants can elect to have their vehicles repaired by their own repair shops, have their vehicles repaired by one of our network shops, or have the entire repair process coordinated by one of our Service Centers. If a customer elects to repair their vehicle through a Service Center, we provide end-to-end resolution for auto physical damage losses. Customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites, where they can pick up a rental vehicle. Our representatives will arrange the repair, including pick-up and delivery of the vehicle, and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete. This innovative, patented approach to the vehicle repair process increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity and improves the cycle time in comparison to our other claims settlement processes. Under the Service Center and network shop options, we guarantee the repairs for as long as the customer owns or leases their car. If a customer decides not to repair their vehicle, our representatives will write an estimate and the customer can receive payment on the spot.

Competitive Factors

The automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Property-casualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price, agent commission rates, consumer recognition and confidence, coverages offered and other product features, claims handling, financial stability, customer service, and geographic coverage. Vigorous competition is provided by large, well-capitalized national companies in both the Agency and Direct channels, and by smaller regional insurers. In the Agency channel, some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents. With widely available comparative rating services, consumers can easily compare prices among competitors. Many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts and/or expanding their online or mobile service offerings. Over the past decade, these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and other property-casualty insurance markets in which we operate.

We rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential. We have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills, closely managing expenses, and achieving operating efficiencies. Superior customer service, fair and accurate claims adjusting, and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy.

Competition in our insurance market is affected by the pace of technological developments.  An insurer’s ability to adapt to change, innovate, develop, and implement new applications and other technologies can affect its competitive position.  In addition, there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which technologies can affect competitive positions. We have eight U.S. patents, and additional patent applications pending, with respect to certain methods, systems, and devices related to usage-based insurance.  Certain of these patents expire on or about January 29, 2016, while others extend well beyond that date. Three of these eight patents were challenged in actions filed with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The challenger prevailed in the initial proceeding on all three of those patents. Perhaps more significantly, we have a substantial amount of “know-how” developed from years of experience with usage-based insurance, and from analyzing the data from over 12 billion driving miles derived from usage-based devices. We believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage in the usage-based insurance market. We also hold a U.S. patent (expiring June 2021), and have a U.S. patent application pending, on the innovative approach to vehicle repair service used in our Service Centers, as described above, and a U.S. patent (expiring in June 2028) on the Name Your Price

®

functionality on our website. In addition, we hold four patents (expiring July 2019), and additional patent applications pending, related to our online policy self-service technology. Two of these four patents have been challenged in actions filed with the PTAB. The challenger has prevailed in these initial proceedings. We have appealed all of the adverse rulings from the PTAB. The patents that are the subject of these rulings remain valid and in effect until all appeals are exhausted.

In addition, we have licensed certain of our patent rights for domestic use to other insurance companies, and we continue to pursue other ways in which to leverage this intellectual property. Currently, we do not expect these licensing activities to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

- 6 -

State Insurance Licenses

Our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. These licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically, provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements. Our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state. Such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria. All licenses that are material to our subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing.

Insurance Regulation

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business. At least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile. Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and its mutual insurance company affiliate are domiciled in the states of Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin. In addition, California and Florida treat certain Progressive subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws.

State insurance laws impose numerous requirements, conditions, and limitations on the operations of insurance companies. Insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations. Regulated areas include, among others:

•

Licensing of insurers and agents,

•

Capital and surplus requirements,

•

Statutory accounting principles specific to insurance companies and the content of required financial and other reports,

•

Requirements for establishing insurance reserves,

•

Investments,

•

Acquisitions of insurers and transactions between insurers and affiliates,

•

Limitations on rates of return or profitability,

•

Rating criteria, rate levels, and rate changes,

•

Insolvencies of insurance companies,

•

Assigned risk programs,

•

Authority to exit a business, and

•

Numerous requirements relating to other areas of insurance operations, including: required coverages, policy forms, underwriting standards, and claims handling.

Insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations. In addition, in some states, the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and, from time to time, may investigate certain insurance company practices.

Insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements. Although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors (including applicable law, the type of business being written, the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves, and the quality of the insurer’s assets), the annual net premiums that an insurer may write historically have been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus, generally 3 to 1. Thus, the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus, in certain cases, may limit its ability to grow its business. At year-end


, we had net premiums written of

$18.7 billion

and statutory surplus of

$6.4 billion

. The combined premiums-to-surplus ratio for all Progressive insurance companies was 2.9 to 1. In addition, as of

December 31, 2014

, we had access to $1.9 billion of securities held in a non-insurance subsidiary, portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth or for other purposes. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) also has developed a risk-based capital (RBC) program to enable regulators to identify and take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition. RBC is a series of dynamic surplus-related formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks, such as asset, credit, and underwriting risks. At

December 31, 2014

, Progressive’s RBC ratios were well in excess of minimum requirements.

- 7 -

Insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business. These reports include:

•

the insurer’s financial statements under statutory accounting principles

•

details concerning claims reserves held by the insurer

•

specific investments held by the insurer, and

•

numerous other disclosures about the insurer’s financial condition and operations.

State insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make. Limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer, as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments. Certain investments are prohibited.

Insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of specified information. These laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions, including loans and cash advances, between insurers and their affiliates. See the “Dividends” discussion in      Item 5(c) below for further information on these dividend limitations. The scope of insurance holding company regulation has expanded as states have adopted the revised model holding company act promulgated by the NAIC in 2010.

Under state insolvency and guaranty laws, insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers. Insurers are also required by many states, as a condition of doing business in the state, to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market. These “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks, as well as the allowable premium. Many states also have involuntary market plans, which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks. These plans, through assessments, pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states.

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market. For example, certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or non-renew policies. Certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or non-renewal of policies, or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements, may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses.

As mentioned above, insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations, including coverages, forms, rating criteria, and rate levels. The ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. Rate regulation varies from “use and file,” to “file and use,” to prior approval.

Regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise. Some changes may be due to economic developments, such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks, while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy, insurance availability, prices, allegations of discriminatory pricing, underwriting practices, and solvency. In recent years, legislation, regulatory measures, and voter initiatives have been introduced, and in some cases adopted, which deal with use of non-public consumer information, use of credit information in underwriting and rating, insurance rate development, rate of return limitations, and the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew insurance policies. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act created a new Federal Insurance Office, which is required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk.

In addition to our U.S. operations, we write personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance in Australia through a branch of one of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. This insurance is offered solely through the Internet. We do not write auto bodily injury liability or medical payment insurance in Australia. There are two primary agencies that regulate insurance in Australia: the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, which regulates consumer disclosures, and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, which regulates solvency. Both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdiction, issue regulations, take enforcement actions, and, in general, have broad regulatory powers. Progressive Direct Insurance Company has been issued licenses by both agencies and the licenses are in good standing.

Statutory Accounting Principles

Our results are reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles (SAP) prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities. Certain significant differences are described below:

Our principal investment goals are to manage our portfolio on a total return basis to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write and contribute to our comprehensive income. Our portfolio is invested primarily in short-term and intermediate-term, investment-grade fixed-income securities. Our investment portfolio had a fair value of

$19.0 billion

at

December 31, 2014

, compared to

$18.1 billion

at

December 31, 2013

. Investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio, shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio, changes in yield, and other factors. Total investment income, including net realized gains (losses) on securities, before expenses and taxes, was $632.6 million in


, compared to $740.4 million in


and $749.8 million in


. On a pretax total return basis (i.e., total investment income plus changes in unrealized gains/losses), investment income was $747.9 million, $870.0 million, and $1,026.6 million for the years ended

Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

The consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries. Our objective is to ensure that total reserves (i.e., case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves, or “IBNR”) are adequate to cover all loss costs, while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed. The liabilities for losses and LAE are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and LAE incurred through December 31 of each year. These estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement, among other factors. These estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates. A detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “Report on Loss Reserving Practices,” which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form  8-K on August 8, 2014, as well as in section “V. Critical Accounting Policies” of our

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation

s in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K. The accompanying tables present information concerning our property-casualty losses and LAE.

The following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years:

RECONCILIATION OF NET RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

- 10 -

Our reserves developed favorably by $24.1 million in 2014, compared to unfavorable development of $45.1 million in 2013 and $22.0 million in 2012, which is reflected as “Incurred related to prior years” in the table above. Total development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves, based on regularly scheduled reviews, claims settling for more or less than reserved, changes in reserve estimates by claim representatives, and emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than anticipated.

During 2014, favorable reserve development in our Commercial Lines business was primarily related to favorable case reserve development on our high limit policies. This favorable development was partially offset by unfavorable development in our Agency auto business, which was primarily in our personal injury protection (PIP) loss reserves and our adjusting and other LAE reserves. Our Direct auto business experienced slight favorable development.

During 2013, unfavorable reserve development in our Commercial Lines business was primarily attributable to higher frequency and severity on late emerging IBNR claims primarily in bodily injury coverage for our truck business. In addition, unfavorable development in our Personal Lines business reflected unfavorable reserve development in our Agency auto business IBNR reserves due to higher frequency and severity on late emerging claims, offset in large part by favorable development in our Direct auto business due to lower than anticipated severity costs on case reserves. We also experienced unfavorable reserve development in our other businesses, primarily due to reserve increases in our run-off professional liability group business, based on internal actuarial reviews of our claims history.

During 2012, unfavorable reserve development in our personal auto product was primarily attributable to reserve development in our Florida PIP coverage and an increase in our estimate of bodily injury severity for accident year 2011. In addition, unfavorable development in our Commercial Lines business reflected higher than anticipated frequency and severity costs on late emerging claims and higher settlements on large losses. This unfavorable development was partially offset by favorable reserve adjustments, primarily in our loss adjustment expense reserves and our personal auto bodily injury reserves for accident years 2009 and 2008.

In establishing loss reserves, we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written. These severities are projected based on historical trends, adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards, inflation, policy provisions, claims resolution practices, and general economic trends. These anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary.

We have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves.

Cumulative development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and LAE - net.

- 12 -

The above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and LAE from 2004 through 2013. The top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at December 31 for each of the indicated years for the property-casualty insurance subsidiaries only. This liability represents the estimated amount of losses and LAE for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date, including IBNR. The table also presents the re-estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE on a gross and net basis, with separate disclosure of the re-estimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses.

The upper section of the table (labeled “Paid (Cumulative) as of”) shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year. The middle portion of the table (labeled “Liability Re-estimated as of”) shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The re-estimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the balance sheet date. The estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years. For example, as of December 31, 2014, our insurance subsidiaries had paid $5,061.2 million of the currently estimated $5,100.6 million of losses and LAE that had been unpaid at the end of 2005; thus, an estimated $39.4 million of losses incurred through 2005 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date.

The “Net Cumulative Development” represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years. For example, the 2004 liability has developed favorably by $429.7 million over ten years. That amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on income in calendar year 2005. The effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and LAE are shown in the reconciliation table on page 11 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and LAE.

In evaluating this information, note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods. For example, the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2014, but incurred in 2011, will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2011, 2012, and 2013. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table.

Our bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2004 and 2005; thus, the reserve run-off for these years was very favorable following the end of each year. The favorable reserve development for 2007 through 2010 was about 3% to 9% of our original carried reserves, which primarily reflects the decreases in severity between our original estimate and what we experienced in both our personal auto and commercial auto businesses during that period. For 2011, 2012, and 2013, we experienced very minimal development, or less than 1% of our original estimate.

Although the detail is not presented in the table on page 13, we also re-estimate the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses each year. The top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year, while the bottom shows the reserves re-estimated based on development in subsequent years. For example, at December 31, 2013, we estimated our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to be $1,045.9 million. During 2014, these reserves developed unfavorably by $57.8 million, bringing the re-estimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to $1,103.7 million, as shown at the bottom of the table. Over the last ten years, we have experienced unfavorable development in our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses. The majority of this development reflects our continuing process of re-evaluating Michigan PIP claims that require lifetime reserve estimates. As a result, we have increased both our direct reserves and corresponding reinsurance recoverables, since these claims are reinsured through the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA) state-mandated plan. The MCCA is funded through an assessment that insurance companies collect from policyholders in the state; therefore, our exposure to losses from the failure of this reinsurer is minimal.

The Analysis of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Development table on page 13 is constructed from Schedule P, Part-1, from the Consolidated Annual Statements of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries, as filed with the state insurance departments.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. Management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives:

•

Insurance Risks -

risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses or liabilities incurred by policyholders

•

Operating Risks -

the

risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations

•

Market Risks -

changes in the value of assets held in our investment portfolios, which might result from a variety of factors impacting the investment marketplace generally, or the sectors, industries, or individual securities in which we have invested, and

•

Credit and Other Financial Risks

- the risks that the other party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms of a contract, or that we will be unable to satisfy our obligations when due or obtain capital when necessary.

In addition, we discuss below certain risks associated with our entering into an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in ARX Holding Corp.

Although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. For example, although presented as an Operating Risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting, investing and financing activities, which are addressed separately under Insurance Risks, Market Risks, and Credit Risks below. These categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed.

It also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. Issues such as unemployment rates, the number of vehicles sold, inflation or deflation, consumer confidence, and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses. In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. In that case, the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially.

This information is not all encompassing and should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the SEC, as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time.

I.

Insurance Risks

Our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders

.

Our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. A primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit.

Pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. Our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:

•

the availability of sufficient, reliable data

•

our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data

•

uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally

•

our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy

•

our ability to predict changes in operating expenses with reasonable accuracy

•

the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies

•

our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those strategies

•

our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis

•

our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately

•

unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory actions

•

the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, hail storms, floods, other severe weather, and terrorist events

•

our ability to understand the impact of ongoing changes in our claims settlement practices

•

changing vehicle usage and driving patterns, as influenced by oil and gas prices, among other factors

•

advancements in vehicle technology and safety features, such as accident prevention technologies or the development of  autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles

•

unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs and systemic changes resulting from national or state health care laws or regulations

•

unforeseen disruptive technologies and events, and

•

unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, and used car prices.

The realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects. In either event, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby constraining our ability to write new business.

- 15 -

Our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves.

Our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. There is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including:

•

the availability of sufficient, reliable data

•

the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, for multiple products in multiple markets

•

unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs

•

unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations

•

new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coverage-related issues by courts

•

the effects of changes in our claims settlement practices

•

our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims

•

the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements

•

the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and

•

the accuracy and timeliness of estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims.

As a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. Consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. Further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” discussion beginning on page 11 of this report, as well as our “Report on Loss Reserving Practices,” which was filed with the SEC on Form 8-K on August 8, 2014.

Our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events.

Catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. The incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable. Moreover, changing climate conditions, whether due to an increase in average temperatures (global climate change) or other causes, may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause.

The extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. We use catastrophe modeling tools and third-party experts to help estimate our exposures to such events. Those tools and expert opinions are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability, and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change. As a result, our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate. An increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes during a given period could materially adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, and results of operations.

II.

Operating Risks

We compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive.

We face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. Other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. Many of these companies have substantial resources, experienced management, and strong marketing, underwriting, and pricing capabilities. The property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, marketing skills, operational effectiveness (including, for example, rate and claim-paying accuracy, customer experience, and application of information and other technologies), pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors.

- 16 -

Our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses, all of which are highly competitive markets. If our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices, offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer, or engage in other successful competitive initiatives, our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be seriously compromised. In addition, due to our focus on the auto insurance market, we may be more sensitive than other insurers to trends that could affect auto insurance coverages and rates over time.  For example, if governmental mandates or restrictions, economic conditions, demographic trends, changing driving patterns, rising gasoline prices, advancements in vehicle technology or safety features, or other factors, were to result in decreased demand for auto insurance or decreased auto insurance rates for an extended period, the automobile insurance market as a whole could shrink and our ability to generate revenue growth could be significantly impaired.

Historically, the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry, with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. This price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market,” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. Unexpected increases in the insurers’ underlying costs (such as vehicle repair costs, medical costs, and the expenses to resolve claims) can reduce profits or result in underwriting losses. As the insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies, as a result of varying loss cost experiences, trend recognition capabilities, and profitability goals), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a “hard market”) in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels. As more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. In the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. We cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future.

The highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition, or in the failure of one or more competitors. The concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted, but which may or may not be favorable for Progressive’s business prospects at that time. In addition, in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a state-sponsored catastrophic fund, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders, which could strain our service capabilities in the near term.

Our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively, respond to our competitors’ initiatives, and efficiently manage complexity, while delivering high quality products and services.

From time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. Based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors’, then-current or historical modes of doing business, and must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment. These innovations also may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes, and thus may add to our costs and entail a high degree of complexity and risk, which makes their implementation a challenge. In addition, our efforts may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). Many of these initiatives are also implemented in cooperation with, or in reliance on, third-party vendors and their systems, which may further limit our control of implementation, quality, customer experiences, and successful outcomes. Our efforts ultimately may not achieve the business goals that we have set. Our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical, however, to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position; if we fail to do so, or if we are unable to maintain the advantage over our competition, our business could be materially adversely affected.

At the same time, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry and adversely affect our competitive position. These developments can include product, pricing, or marketing innovations, new or improved services, technological advances, or new ways of doing business, among other initiatives. Recent examples of significant developments in the marketplace include: new ways for customers to shop and compare prices from multiple companies, the growth in mobile communications and consumers’ desire to transact business on mobile devices, the prominence of social media as a source of information for consumers, and the availability of very large volumes of data and the challenges related to analyzing those data sets (sometimes referred to as “Big Data”). Our ability to react to such advances, develop and maintain winning strategies, and then navigate the new competitive environment is important to our success.

- 17 -

Ongoing competitive, technological, regulatory, and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. This complexity may create barriers to implementing or defending certain new ideas or providing high-quality products and customer experiences, may require us to modify our business practices, to adopt new systems, or to upgrade or replace outdated systems, each at significant expense, and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies. In addition, we must make difficult decisions regarding the optimal allocation of available resources (such as information technology resources) for competing initiatives or projects.

Complexity in our industry is compounded by the proliferation of patents related to new ways in which vehicle insurance is being marketed, sold, and serviced, which may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and non-insurance entities alleging that we are violating their patent rights.  Similarly, we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us.  However, defending our business practices against patent challenges, and enforcing and defending our patent rights, including if necessary through litigation, can be time consuming and expensive, and the results are inherently uncertain, further complicating business plans related to these efforts.

If we are unable to manage this complexity effectively, to bring new ideas to market, to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources, or to prevent errors, our businesses could experience a decreased ability to compete effectively for insurance business, poor experiences for customers, substantially increased costs, liability to third parties, the need to modify our business processes, regulatory investigations and sanctions, and damage to our brand.

We must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers.

It is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the Progressive brand. We undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, enhance consumers’ perceptions of us, generate new business, and increase the retention of our current customers. We believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the automobile insurance market. If our campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised, our business could be materially adversely affected.

Our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company. These situations might include, among others, failing to protect sensitive customer information, systems failures, effects of actual or perceived vulnerabilities to cyber attacks (such as computer hacking, data theft, system disruption, and viruses and malware), errors in handling a customer’s policy, inappropriate handling of claims, misconduct by our officers, directors or employees or others acting on our behalf, inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to our systems failures or the failure of third-party systems that we use, facility shut-downs or other causes, litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices, and actions by our other business partners, including unaffiliated businesses through which we offer bundled products (such as homeowners insurance), and many of the other matters that are discussed in these Risk Factors. Moreover, the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control.

Our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success.

Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, compensate, motivate, and retain talented employees, including executives, other key managers, and employees with strong technical, analytical, and other skills necessary for us to run our business. Our loss of certain key officers and employees, or the failure to attract or develop talented executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a materially adverse effect on our business.

In addition, we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly. Our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing quality and our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. In either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, employee morale, and brand could be materially adversely affected.

- 18 -

Our success also depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years. Our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace, as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that  affect our employees. In such events, the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins.

The Progressive Corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations.

Progressive’s insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Australia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. In addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers, in a wide range of areas, such as the use of credit information, privacy, and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government. Our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success.

Most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. Our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, or by court-imposed interpretations of those laws or regulations, such as, in recent years, matters concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting, procedures for settling claims with our insureds and claimants, and efforts to freeze, set, or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn. Insurance laws and regulations may limit, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders, and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold. Moreover, inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts, potentially resulting in additional costs being imposed on us.  In addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances, including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. Compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. These costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions.

The actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, federal officials, or other law enforcement officials. Such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to significant monetary payments, fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in certain cases, revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, The Progressive Corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations.

New federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. From time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. At this time, we are unable to predict whether any additional state or federal laws or regulations will be enacted as a result of legislative, regulatory or reform efforts, and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses.

Insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. For further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the “Insurance Regulation” discussion beginning on page 8 of this report.

- 19 -

Our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately.

We must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. Many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience, and skill of our claims representatives, the extent of and our ability to recognize and respond to fraudulent or inflated claims, the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of its management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support our claims functions, and the effectiveness of our Service Center program and other methods of resolving claims. Our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity.

Lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future.

The Progressive Corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations. Other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. These lawsuits have recently included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the U.S. Fair Credit Reporting Act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures; challenges to our direct repair program and Service Center program; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; policy implementation and renewal procedures; and employment-related litigation, including federal wage and hour claims, among other matters. From time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that certain of our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Additional litigation may be filed against us concerning allegations of other general liability theories. In addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries’ business operations.

Lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief. The potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices, including how vehicles are repaired and other claims are settled.  Moreover, the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of court-imposed regulation, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business.

Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability, or financial condition. For further information on pending litigation, see

Note 12 - Litigation

in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

Our business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors.

Our business requires that we build and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire, including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information. These systems are subject to attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities. Such attacks may include, among other things, attempts to gain unauthorized access to:

•

steal, corrupt, or destroy data

•

misappropriate funds

•

disrupt or shut down our systems

•

deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or

•

infect our systems with viruses or malware.

Similarly, an employee, consultant, agent, or other person with legitimate access to our systems may take actions, or be the subject of a security breach or cyber attack, which could result in improper or unauthorized access to our systems, and in the loss, corruption, or theft of our intellectual property or the personal information of our customers or employees.

- 20 -

We also conduct significant business functions and computer operations using the systems of third-party vendors, which may provide software, data storage, communication, and other computer services to us (some of which may be referred to as “cloud computing”). These third-party systems may experience cyber attacks and other security breaches, along with the possible risk of loss, corruption, or unauthorized publication of Progressive’s information or the confidential information of our customers and employees. These relationships present further risk management challenges for us, including, among others: confirming and monitoring the third-party’s security measures; the potential for improper handling of or access to, or the inability to retrieve, our data; and data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions, where laws or security measures may be inadequate.

We undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information. These efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective, and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection. Examples include physical security measures, access and password policies, firewalls, systems monitoring, malicious code protection, network and host-based intrusion detection and prevention measures, data loss prevention measures, configuration assurance, data encryption, and event management, as well as third-party testing. In addition, we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under “cloud computing” or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation, security and financial due diligence, contracts designed to set and maintain high security and confidentiality standards, and ongoing testing, auditing, and evaluation of third-party compliance with the required standards. While we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun.

Our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. In addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer information is stolen or if another party’s systems are adversely affected. In addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations, adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen, and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand, potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us. We have elected to self-insure these risks at this time. The occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity.

We also rely heavily on credit card acceptance for payment of premiums and claims deductibles. Data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI), an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors. These standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures that companies accepting credit card payments, such as Progressive, must satisfy with respect to the handling of sensitive information. While the PCI standards set a high bar for data security, compliance with them does not alone ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis. In September 2014, an independent organization recognized by PCI for such purposes, recertified Progressive as being in compliance with the current PCI standards. The PCI data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and annual recertification of our processes. Our intention is to maintain compliance with PCI's data security standards. The failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments.

Our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions.

Our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions (such as Internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims and other obligations. Our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks (as discussed above), riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities. Likewise, we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.

- 21 -

The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. In addition, many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on third-party systems; we could experience service denials if demand for a third party’s services exceeds capacity or if a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. If sustained or repeated, and if an alternate system, process, or vendor is not immediately available to us, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, resolve and pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill and to our brand.

We maintain insurance on our real property and other physical assets, including coverage for losses due to business interruptions caused by covered property damage. However, the insurance will not compensate us for losses that may occur due to disruptions in service as a result of a computer, data processing, or telecommunications systems failure, cyber attack, or other event that is unrelated to covered property damage, nor will the insurance necessarily compensate us for all losses resulting from covered events. To help maintain functionality and reduce the risk of significant interruptions of our operations, we maintain back-up systems or facilities for certain of our systems. In addition, if such a significant interruption occurs or is threatened, we have developed processes designed to maintain certain of our business operations and, if necessary, to recover our systems after such an event has occurred. We still may be exposed, however, should these measures prove to be unsuccessful or inadequate to protect against interruptions of systems where no back-up currently exists or against severe, multiple, or prolonged service interruptions. We have established emergency management teams, which are responsible for responding to business disruptions and other risk events. The teams’ ability to respond successfully may be limited depending on the nature of the event, the completeness and effectiveness of our plans to maintain business continuity and recover our systems upon the occurrence of such an event, and other factors beyond our control.

We rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers. These include credit card and debit card networks and  the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network; other such networks or payment systems may be developed in the future. Our ability to participate in these networks is dependent on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory authorities. If we fail to comply with legal requirements or a network’s rules, we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties, including, in certain cases, the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system.  Such fines and penalties, and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically, could materially adversely affect our business and our brand.

Our business is also highly dependent on access to, and the operation of, the financial markets and related facilities to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis. Disruptions in financial markets, or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems, could limit our ability to meet payment obligations. A mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs, or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed, also could adversely affect our ability to make timely payments.

III.

Market Risks

The performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks.

Our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. Our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. The performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including:

•

Interest rate risk

- the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates.

•

Investment credit risk

- the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to a deterioration in the financial condition, operating performance or business prospects of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities. This risk includes the possibility of permanent loss. In the case of governmental issuers, the risk includes the potential for unbalanced budgets, required austerity measures, debt defaults, bankruptcies, or other social or political turmoil.

•

Concentration risk

- the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of, or outlook for, those issuers, sectors, or industries.

- 22 -

•

Prepayment or extension risk

- applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities and other bonds with call provisions. Prepayment risk is the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, requiring that we reinvest the proceeds at less attractive rates. Extension risk is the risk that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of the security and preventing the reinvestment of the principal at higher market rates.

•

Liquidity risk

- the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so.  Disruptions in the financial markets, or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us.

In addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. The fixed-income portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: there is a deterioration in the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase; credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions.

The common equity portfolio is primarily managed by a third party to track the Russell 1000 Index, with a small portion actively managed by external investment advisory firms. Our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. An investment portfolio that is designed to track an index, such as the Russell 1000, or that follows a specific investment discipline, such as value investing, does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. Equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and also may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, as discussed above. In addition, even though the Russell 1000 Index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, such as energy, technology, or financial services, which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio if such a sector underperforms. A decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital.  Likewise, the actively managed equity portfolio will be subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisors, including sector or industry concentrations, lack of geographic diversification, and the performance of individual issuers.

Both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets. The functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold, and our ability to liquidate them when desired may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation:

•

local, national, or international events, such as regulatory changes, power outages, system failures, wars, or terrorist attacks

•

a recession, depression, political or social upheaval, or other development in either the U.S. or other economies that adversely affects the value of securities held in our portfolios

•

financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, which could further disrupt the markets or cause us to incur losses if counterparties to one or more of our transactions should default

•

inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired

•

the failure, or perceived failure, of governmental attempts to stabilize their budgets or economies through austerity programs, tax increases or other measures, to stabilize specific companies or groups of companies through capital injections, to shore up markets, or otherwise to spur economic recovery or growth, or the failure or refusal of a government to engage in such efforts

•

investor fear, whether substantiated or not

•

a significant change in inflation expectations or the onset of deflation

•

a default on sovereign debt, or the perception that such a default is likely, and

•

a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events.

- 23 -

If the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market, sector, or issuer-specific conditions, our liquidity, financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. A decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business. In any such event, our business could be materially adversely affected.

See

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2014, and of the market risk associated with our investment portfolio.

IV.

Credit and Other Financial Risks

Our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of contractual obligations.

Our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements. These include, for example: contracts for the acquisition of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology facilities, equipment and support, and other systems and services that are integral to our operations); agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer; and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies and the performance of certain state reinsurance facilities/associations relating to extreme events or certain catastrophic claims). In addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks, other financial institutions, or security clearinghouses. If one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, obligation, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems, which in turn could adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation.

Our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay, which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to repay indebtedness, make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase its securities, or meet its other obligations.

The Progressive Corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to The Progressive Corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, Progressive may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness, make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase its common shares or other securities, or meet its other obligations. Each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors:

•

insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus

•

insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company

•

competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings, and

•

in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company.

Further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in Item 5(c), “Dividends,” of this report.

- 24 -

If we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected.

We intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to meet regulatory requirements, to support the growth of our insurance businesses, to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses, and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends, repurchase stock or other securities, and fund corporate opportunities. Management determines our capital needs at any given time based on a number of factors, including:

•

regulatory capital and surplus requirements applicable to our insurance subsidiaries

•

current and anticipated performance of our insurance operations and investment portfolios

•

growth prospects for our insurance businesses

•

expected significant expenditures and available business opportunities

•

our capital management activities, such as scheduled debt payments, the payment of cash dividends, repurchases of our common shares and debt securities, the availability of credit lines, and the issuance by us of debt, equity, or other securities, and

•

projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level determined through our risk management process.

The amount of capital that we seek to maintain also is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing, and operating risks, including those discussed in these Risk Factors. The estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face. While we regularly implement new measures to improve our techniques for estimating our capital needs, our ability to predict accurately the nature, size, and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain.

If regulatory requirements for capital and surplus were to increase, we likely would be required to increase the amount of capital held by our insurance subsidiaries.  Also, if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio, our capital levels may be reduced, perhaps significantly. If our capital level falls lower than the amount needed at a given time, our ability to grow and successfully operate the insurance business could be constrained, and our flexibility to pay dividends, repurchase our securities, or engage in other corporate transactions could be limited, until additional sources of capital are secured. Such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators and other third parties (such as rating agencies, underwriters, institutional and other investors, and consumers), potentially resulting in regulatory actions or our inability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates, and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly.

In addition, the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that, in part, depend on the substantial recovery to original cost of our fixed-income securities and redeemable preferred stocks. Should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value, a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary, which would reduce our capital levels.

Our access to capital markets, ability to enter into new or renew existing financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies.

Our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings, and A.M. Best. Progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. Downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. Perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses, and consumers could also be significantly impaired. In addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral, in cash or high-grade assets, for the benefit of the other party to the transaction, or allow the other party to liquidate the derivatives transaction. Downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. In any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.

- 25 -

The Progressive Corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the Board of Directors.

We have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the Board of Directors (33-1/3% for 2014 and 2015) and then by the Gainshare factor (determined under our employee Gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses). If our Gainshare factor for the year is zero or after-tax comprehensive income (which includes net investment income, realized investment gains and losses, and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses) is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy.

Because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). As a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations. In addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual variable dividend in 2015 (to be paid early in 2016), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the Board until late 2015 or early 2016, and the Board retains the discretion, at any time, to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2015 or future years. Such an action by the Board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in U.S. federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity, financial position or prospects, as described above under “Market Risks.” Any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares or debt securities.

We do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which, at times, may adversely affect short-term results.

We believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. We do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. We report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. We also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. As a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors’ expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities.

In addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term performance, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term results, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. Such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers, or increases in advertising spend, to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. Consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year, and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities.

V.

Risks Associated with the ARX Transaction

The anticipated acquisition of control of ARX Holding Corp. may not occur or may occur on terms

different than those initially contemplated.

It is possible that the contemplated acquisition of ARX capital stock may not occur because the conditions to the closing of the transaction are not satisfied or for another reason. In addition, there is a risk that the transactions may not be consummated on the terms contemplated, as a result of changed circumstances or because of requirements imposed by insurance or other regulatory authorities.

- 26 -

If the anticipated acquisition is consummated, it may not produce the anticipated benefits to the company and may present new operational or other risks for us.

If the acquisition is consummated, it may not produce the anticipated benefits to the company, or such benefits may be delayed longer than anticipated, and ARX may not perform as expected, may have unknown liabilities and may present unanticipated operational or other risks. ARX will continue to be, and the company will become, dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of ARX’s officers and key employees to execute their business plans. In addition, the homeowners insurance business differs from our current business in certain respects. Catastrophe losses, including those caused by adverse weather conditions (including hurricanes, floods, tornadoes and severe storms), may impact homeowners insurance results more than they impact our current results. Further, like many homeowners insurance companies, ARX relies on reinsurance contracts to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events. Nonetheless, ARX remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured and is subject to credit risk with respect to its ability to recover from reinsurers for the claims it paid.

Our consolidated debt is expected to increase as a result of the acquisition and our debt rating may be adversely affected.

As of December 31, 2014, ARX had outstanding external borrowings of $191.3 million, a significant portion of which is secured by the stock of certain of ARX’s key subsidiaries. This debt will remain outstanding after the acquisition, and it is possible that our debt rating could be adversely affected as a result, which may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets, and increase our interest expense on any future indebtedness.

The anticipated acquisition will affect our accounting and the comparability of our results.

If the acquisition is consummated, the financial results of ARX and its subsidiaries will be consolidated in our financial results. Reporting the results of a writer of homeowners insurance may introduce additional volatility in our consolidated results, particularly because we report our results on a monthly basis. In addition, because we will own less than one hundred percent of ARX for some period of time, the other holders of ARX capital stock will have an interest in the assets and operating results of ARX, and their interests will be reflected on our financial statements. These changes will introduce more complexity to our financial statements and may affect the ability of investors or analysts to assess our financial results.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

We currently do not have any unresolved comments from the SEC staff.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

All of our properties are owned or leased by subsidiaries of The Progressive Corporation and are used for office functions (corporate, claims, and business unit), as call centers, for training, for warehouse space, or as Service Centers.

We own 88 buildings located throughout the United States. Nearly two-thirds of our owned buildings are for our Service Centers, the majority of which are combined with a claims office. Our owned facilities, which contain approximately 4.6 million square feet of space, are not segregated by industry segment. In addition to our corporate headquarters and another office complex and call center in Mayfield Village, Ohio, we own significant locations in Colorado Springs, Colorado; Tampa, Florida; and Tempe, Arizona.

We lease approximately 2.1 million square feet of space throughout the United States and one location in Australia. These leases are generally short-term to medium-term leases of commercial space.

PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

(a) Market Information

Progressive’s Common Shares, $1.00 par value, are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PGR. The high and low prices set forth below are as reported on the consolidated transaction reporting system.

The closing price of our common shares on January 30,


, was $25.95.

(b) Holders

We had 2,359 shareholders of record on

December 31, 2014

.

(c) Dividends

We maintain a policy of paying an annual variable dividend that, if declared, would be payable shortly after the close of the year. This annual variable dividend is based on a target percentage of after-tax underwriting income multiplied by a companywide performance factor (“Gainshare factor”), subject to the limitations discussed below. The target percentage is determined by our Board of Directors on an annual basis and announced to shareholders and the public. In December


, the Board determined the target percentage for


to be 33-1/3% of annual after-tax underwriting income, which is unchanged from the target percentage in both


and


. The Board also determined that this target will remain at 33-1/3% for


.

The Gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing our operating performance for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives for our core insurance businesses, as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board. This Gainshare factor is also used in the annual cash incentive program currently in place for our employees (our “Gainsharing program”). Although recalibrated every year, the structure of the Gainsharing program generally remains the same. Our annual dividend program will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, subject to certain limitations. If the Gainshare factor is zero or if our comprehensive income is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend would be payable under our annual variable dividend policy.

Although it is our intent to calculate an annual variable dividend based on the formula outlined above, the Board could decide to alter our policy, or not to pay the annual variable dividend for


or future years, at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year. Such an action by the Board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our business, liquidity, or financial position.

, $549.2 million of consolidated statutory surplus represented net admitted assets of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate that are required to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements in such entities’ states of domicile. The companies may be licensed in states other than their states of domicile, however, which may have higher minimum statutory surplus requirements. Generally, the net admitted assets of insurance companies that, subject to other applicable insurance laws and regulations, are available for transfer to the parent company cannot include the net admitted assets required to meet the minimum statutory surplus requirements of the states where the companies are licensed.  Based on the dividend laws currently in effect, the insurance subsidiaries could pay aggregate dividends of $1,346.5 million in


without prior approval from regulatory authorities, provided the dividend payments are not made within 12 months of previous dividends paid by the applicable subsidiary.
