PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

(a) General Development of Business

The Progressive insurance organization began business in 1937. The Progressive Corporation, an
insurance holding company formed in 1965, currently has 65 subsidiaries and 1 mutual insurance
company affiliate. Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate provide personal and
commercial automobile insurance and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related
services throughout the United States. Our property-casualty insurance products protect our
customers against losses due to collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles and uninsured
and underinsured bodily injury, and liability to others for personal injury or property damage
arising out of the use of those vehicles. Our non-insurance subsidiaries generally support our
insurance and investment operations.

(b) Financial Information About Segments

Incorporated by reference from

Note 9 — Segment Information

, beginning on page App.-A-22 of the
Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

We offer a number of personal and commercial property-casualty insurance products primarily related
to motor vehicles. Net premiums written were $13.8 billion in 2007, compared to $14.1 billion in
2006 and $14.0 billion in 2005. Our combined ratio, calculated in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), was 92.6 in 2007, 86.7 in
2006 and 88.1 in 2005.

Organization

We write private passenger auto insurance and the majority of our special lines products in 49
states; we expect to begin writing private passenger auto in Massachusetts during the second
quarter 2008 and special lines later in the year. We also write private passenger auto in the
District of Columbia. We write commercial auto policies in 49 states; we do not currently write
commercial auto in Hawaii or the District of Columbia.

Auto insurance differs greatly by community because regulations and legal decisions vary by state
and because, among other factors, traffic, law enforcement, cultural attitudes, insurance agents,
medical services and auto repair services vary by community. To respond to these local
differences, we are organized as follows:

•

Our Personal Lines product management group is organized by state into four geographical
regions, led by a general manager for each region for our private passenger auto products.
The special lines product management group is organized by product and led by a general
manager.

•

Our Commercial Auto Business is organized by state with product managers responsible for
local implementation. These state-level managers are led by a general manager.

•

Our Claims business area is organized into six geographical regions, with a general
manager responsible for each region.

•

Our business area general managers each report to one of our Group Presidents (discussed
below).



Our Customer Service groups, located at call centers in Mayfield Village, Ohio; Austin, Texas;
Tampa, Florida; Sacramento, California; Tempe, Arizona; and Colorado Springs, Colorado, support our
underwriting and claims operations.

Our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions and includes the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief
Information Officer and Chief Human Resource Officer, as well as our three Group Presidents
(Personal Lines, Commercial Lines and Claims). The Group Presidents are responsible for the
development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are
tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and
select our insurance products.

Personal Lines

Our Personal Lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreational and
other vehicles. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each
program targeted to a specific distribution channel, market or customer group. The Personal Lines
Business accounted for 87% of total net premiums written in 2007, compared to 86% in 2006 and 87%
in 2005. Our strategy is to be the low-cost provider of a full line of auto insurance products
with superior service, distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers.

We ranked third in industry market share for 2006 based on net premiums written, and believe that
we are in a virtual tie for third for 2007. There are approximately 370 competitors in the total
private passenger auto market. Progressive and the other leading 15 private passenger auto
insurers, each of whom write over $2 billion of premiums, comprise about 75% of this market. For
2007, the estimated industry net premiums written for personal auto insurance in the United States
was $160.8 billion, and our share of this market was approximately 7.2%, compared to $160.2 billion
and 7.4%, respectively, in 2006, and $159.6 billion and 7.5% in 2005. Except as otherwise noted,
all industry data and our market share or ranking in the industry either were derived directly from
data reported by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) or were estimated using A.M. Best data as
the primary source.

Private passenger automobile insurance represented 90% of our total Personal Lines net premiums
written in 2007, compared to 91% in 2006 and 92% in 2005. Volume potential is driven by our price
competitiveness, brand recognition, service quality and the actions of our competitors, among other
factors. See “Competitive Factors” on page 5 of this report for further discussion.

Our specialty Personal Lines products include insurance for motorcycles, recreational vehicles,
mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles and similar items. Due to the nature of these products, we
typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months. Our competitors are specialty
companies and large multi-line insurance carriers. Although industry figures are not available,
based on our analysis of this market, we believe that we are one of the largest participants in the
specialty personal lines market, and that we have been the market share leader for personal
watercraft insurance since 2002 and for the motorcycle product since 1998.

We also started offering a Personal Umbrella insurance product in select markets in 2006. This
product was expanded in 2007 and is currently being offered through certain independent agents in
13 states and to Direct business customers in three states. We plan to continue to expand this
product to an additional 12 states for the Agency business in 2008. We will continue to evaluate
the customer service experience through the Direct channel before determining to what extent and
how to expand this product offering to additional markets during 2008.

The Personal Lines Business is generated either by independent agents and brokers or written
directly online or by phone. The Agency business includes business written by our network of more
than 30,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United States, as well as
brokerages in New York and California. These independent insurance agents and brokers have the
ability to place business with Progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed
underwriting guidelines, subject to compliance with company-mandated procedures. Our guidelines
prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be
charged for specified categories of risk. The agents and brokers do not have authority on behalf of
Progressive to establish underwriting guidelines, develop rates, settle or adjust claims, or enter
into other



transactions or commitments. The Agency business also writes through strategic alliance business
relationships with other insurance companies, financial institutions and national agencies. In
2007, the total net premiums written through the Agency business represented 63% of our Personal
Lines volume, compared to 64% in 2006 and 66% in 2005.

The Direct business includes business written directly by us online and over the phone. Net
premiums written in the Direct business were 37%, 36% and 34% of our Personal Lines volume in 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively.

Commercial Auto

The Commercial Auto Business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles
and trucks owned by small businesses and represented 13% of our total net premiums written in 2007,
compared to 14% in 2006 and 13% in 2005. The majority of our Commercial Auto customers insure
three or fewer vehicles. The Commercial Auto Business, which is primarily distributed through the
independent agency channel, operates in the specialty truck and business auto markets. The
specialty truck commercial auto market, which accounts for slightly more than half of the total
Commercial Auto premiums and approximately 40% of the vehicles we insure in this business, includes
dump trucks, logging trucks, tow trucks, local cartage and other short-haul commercial vehicles.
The remainder is in the business auto market, which includes autos, vans and pick-up trucks used by
artisans, such as contractors, landscapers and plumbers, and a variety of other small businesses.
In 2007, we introduced cargo and general liability insurance in select markets, with further state
expansion in 2008. Although the Commercial Auto Business differs from Personal Lines auto in its
customer bases and products written, both businesses require the same fundamental skills, including
disciplined underwriting and pricing, as well as excellent claims service. There are approximately
370 competitors in the total commercial auto market. We primarily compete with approximately 30
other large companies/groups, each with over $200 million of commercial auto premiums written
annually. These leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75% of this market. Our Commercial
Auto Business ranked third in the commercial auto insurance market for 2006, and we believe that we
held that position for 2007.

Other Indemnity Businesses

Our other indemnity businesses, which represented less than 1% of our 2007, 2006 and 2005 net
premiums written, include providing professional liability insurance to community banks,
principally directors and officers liability insurance. We reinsure the majority of the risk on
these coverages with a small mutual reinsurer controlled by its bank customers and various other
reinsurance entities. The program, sponsored by the American Bankers Association, insures over
1,700 banks, representing every state. In addition, our other indemnity businesses include
managing our run-off businesses.

Service Businesses

Our service businesses include providing insurance-related services, primarily policy issuance and
claims adjusting services in 27 states for Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans (CAIP), which
are state-supervised plans serving the involuntary markets. We process approximately half of the
premiums in the CAIP market and compete with two other providers countrywide. One of these other
carriers has indicated that it will cease writing new business in 2008, and we expect our market
share of this business will increase as a result. As a service provider, we collect fee revenue
that is earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related policies. We cede 100% of the
premiums and losses to the plans. Reimbursements to us from the CAIP plans are required by state
laws and regulations. Material violations of contractual service standards can result in ceding
restrictions for the affected business. We have maintained, and plan to continue to maintain,
compliance with these standards. Any changes in our participation as a CAIP service provider would
not materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The service
businesses represented less than 1% of our 2007, 2006 and 2005 revenues.

Claims

We manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 475 claims offices
located throughout the United States. In addition, we have in operation 54 centers, in 41
metropolitan areas across the country, that provide our concierge level claims service. These
facilities are designed to provide end-to-end resolution for auto physical damage losses. Customers
can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites, where they can pick up a rental vehicle.
Our representatives will then write the estimate, select a qualified repair shop, arrange the
repair, including pick up and delivery of the vehicle, and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are



complete. This innovative approach to the vehicle repair process, increases consumer satisfaction,
increases our productivity and improves the cycle time and quality of
repairs. Concierge level of
claims service is our primary approach to damage assessment and
coordination of vehicle repairs at authorized auto repair facilities
in these markets. We expect to construct 5 new centers in 2008 and 2009, of which 3 centers will
replace existing leased facilities. We are pleased to report that on January 29, 2008, we received
a U.S. patent for our unique concierge-level method of managing the vehicle repair process.

Competitive Factors

The automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets in which we operate are highly
competitive. Property-casualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price, consumer
recognition, coverages offered and other product features, claims handling, financial stability,
customer service and geographic coverage. Vigorous competition is provided by large,
well-capitalized national companies, some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or
captive agents, and by smaller regional insurers. Over the last few years, third party comparative
rating services have gained prominence, adding transparency to industry pricing, and many of our
competitors have significantly increased their advertising and marketing efforts and/or expanded
their online service offerings. These changes have further intensified the competitive nature of
the automobile and other property-casualty insurance markets.

We rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and
price accurately according to risk potential. We have remained competitive by refining our risk
measurement and price segmentation skills, closely managing expenses and achieving operating
efficiencies. Superior customer service, fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand
recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy.

State Insurance Licenses

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance
authorities. These licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically, provided the
holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements. Our licenses govern the kinds of
insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state. Such
licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the
satisfaction of prescribed criteria. All licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’
businesses are in good standing.

Insurance Regulation

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by
insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact
business. At least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each
of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The nature and extent of such regulation and
supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, an insurance company is subject
to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile. Progressive’s insurance
subsidiaries and affiliate are domiciled in the states of Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan,
New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin. State insurance departments have broad
administrative power relating to licensing insurers and agents, regulating premium changes and
policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, prescribing statutory accounting methods and the
form and content of statutory financial reports, and regulating the type and amount of investments
permitted. Rate regulation varies from “use and file,” to “file and use,” to prior approval, to
mandated rates.

Insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies
maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards.
Insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the
insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business. Insurance departments
are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition
and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory
accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations.

Insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the
power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic
disclosure of certain information. These laws impose prior approval requirements for certain
transactions between regulated insurers and their



affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions, including loans and cash
advances, between regulated insurers and their affiliates. See the “Dividends” discussion in Item
5(c) for further information on these dividend limitations.

Under state insolvency and guaranty laws, regulated insurers can be assessed or required to
contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of
other insurers. Insurers are also required by many states, as a condition of doing business in the
state, to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market. These
“assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must
be offered to such involuntary risks, as well as the allowable premium. Many states also have
involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to
involuntary risks. These plans, through assessments, pass underwriting and administrative expenses
on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states.

Insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus
to support their writings. Although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow
is a function of a number of factors (including applicable law, the type of business being written,
the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets), the annual net
premiums that an insurer may write have historically been perceived to be limited to a specified
multiple of the insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus, generally 3 to 1. Thus, the amount of an
insurer’s surplus, in certain cases, may limit its ability to grow its business. At year-end 2007,
the combined premiums to surplus ratio for all Progressive insurance companies was 3.0 to 1,
although we have access to $2.1 billion in a non-insurance subsidiary, portions of which could be
contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth as needed. The National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) also has developed a risk-based capital (RBC) program
to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that
show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition. RBC is a series of dynamic
surplus-related formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances
based on the degree of certain risks, such as asset, credit and underwriting risks. Progressive’s
RBC ratios are well in excess of minimum requirements.

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market. For
example, certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or non-renew policies.
Certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the
state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state
insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption.
Laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or non-renewal of policies, or that subject
program withdrawals to prior approval requirements, may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit
unprofitable markets or businesses.

Regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise.
Some changes may be due to economic developments, such as changes in investment laws made to
recognize new investment products; other changes result from such general pressures as consumer
resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices
and solvency. In recent years, legislation, regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been
introduced, and in some cases adopted, which deal with use of non-public consumer information, use
of financial responsibility and credit information in underwriting, insurance rate development,
rate of return limitations, rate determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew
insurance policies, reflecting concerns about consumer privacy, coverage, availability, prices and
alleged discriminatory pricing. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and
certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine
whether federal regulation is necessary.

In a number of states, Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit
information (credit) as part of the underwriting or rating process. This practice is expressly
authorized by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, and our information demonstrates that credit
is an effective predictor of insurance risk. The use of credit in underwriting and rating is the
subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity. Regulators and legislators have
expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit, including: questions regarding the
accuracy of credit reports, perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and
certain minority groups, the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit
and insurance risk, the treatment of persons with limited or no credit, the impact on credit of
extraordinary life events (e.g., catastrophic injury or death of a spouse), and the credit
attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers. A number of state



insurance departments have issued bulletins, directives or regulations to regulate the use of
credit by insurers. In addition, a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to
regulate insurers’ use of credit. Also, at the direction of Congress, the Federal Trade Commission
studied the effects of the use of credit information on the availability and affordability of
insurance and the extent to which credit information impacted the availability and affordability of
insurance by geography, income, ethnicity, and race. As a result of this study, it is possible that
Congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting the use of credit in
underwriting and rating.

In some states, the automobile insurance industry has been under pressure in past years from
regulators, legislators or special interest groups to reduce, freeze or set rates to or at levels
that are not necessarily related to underlying costs, including initiatives to roll back automobile
and other personal lines rates. Automobile insurers have also been subject to legislative and
regulatory actions designed to limit their ability to manage effectively the cost of motor vehicle
repairs. These kinds of activities have affected adversely, and in the future may affect
adversely, the profitability and growth of our subsidiaries’ automobile insurance business in those
jurisdictions, and may limit the subsidiaries’ ability to increase rates to compensate for
increases in costs. Adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the subsidiaries’ ability
to price automobile insurance adequately or to manage the cost of motor vehicle repairs, or that
could affect the subsidiaries’ insurance operations adversely in other ways, may occur in the
future. The impact of these legislative or regulatory changes on the subsidiaries’ businesses
cannot be predicted.

Statutory Accounting Principles

Our results are reported in accordance with GAAP, which differ in certain respects from amounts
reported under statutory accounting principles (SAP) prescribed by insurance regulatory
authorities. Certain significant differences are described below:

Category

GAAP Accounting

SAP Accounting

Acquisition Expenses

Commissions,
premium taxes and
other variable
costs incurred in
connection with
writing new and
renewal business
are capitalized and
amortized pro rata
over the policy
term as premiums
are earned.

Commissions, premium taxes and all other
acquisition expenses are expensed as incurred.

Non-admitted Assets

Premium receivables
are reported net of
an allowance for
doubtful accounts.

Premium receivables over 90 days past due are
“non-admitted,” which means they are written off
against surplus. For premium receivables less
than 90 days past due, we also estimate a bad
debt reserve.

Furniture,
equipment,
application
software, leasehold
improvements and
prepaid expenses
are capitalized and
amortized over
their useful lives
or periods
benefited.

Excluding computer equipment and operating
software, the value of all other furniture,
equipment, application software, leasehold
improvements and prepaid expenses, net of
accumulated depreciation or amortization, is
non-admitted against surplus. Computer equipment
and operating software are capitalized, subject
to statutory limitations based on surplus, and
depreciated over three years.

Deferred tax assets
are recorded based
on estimated future
tax effects
attributable to
temporary
differences. A
valuation allowance
is recorded for any
tax benefits that
are not expected to
be realized.

Deferred tax assets that do not meet certain
statutory requirements for recognition are
non-admitted against surplus.

Reinsurance

Ceded reinsurance
balances are shown
as an asset on the
balance sheet as
“prepaid
reinsurance
premiums” and
“reinsurance
recoverables.”

Ceded unearned premiums are netted against the
“unearned premiums” liability. Ceded unpaid
loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) amounts
are netted against “loss and LAE reserves.”
Only ceded paid loss and LAE are shown as a
“reinsurance recoverables” asset.

Investment Valuation

Fixed-maturity
securities, which
are classified as
available-for-sale,
are reported at
current fair
values.

Fixed-maturity securities are reported at
amortized cost or the lower of amortized cost or
fair value, depending on the class of security.

Preferred stocks
are reported at
quoted fair values.

Redeembable preferred stocks are reported at
amortized cost or the lower of amortized cost or
fair value, depending on the class of security.
Nonredeemable preferred stocks are reported at
quoted fair value.

Federal Income Taxes

Federal tax expense
and tax liability
or recoverable
balances include
current and
deferred income
taxes.

For income statement reporting, federal tax
expense only includes the current tax provision.
Deferred taxes are posted to surplus. SAP
deferred tax assets are subject to certain
limitations.

Investments

We employ a conservative approach to investment and capital management intended to ensure that we
have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premium that we can profitably write. Our
portfolio is invested primarily in short-term and intermediate-term, investment-grade fixed-income
securities. Our investment portfolio had a fair value of $14.2 billion at December 31, 2007,
compared to $14.7 billion at December 31, 2006. Investment income is affected by the variability
of cash flows to or from the portfolio, shifts in the type and quality of investments in the
portfolio, changes in yield and other factors. Investment income, including net realized gains
(losses) on securities, before expenses and taxes, was $787.1 million in 2007, compared to $638.1
million in 2006 and $498.8 million in 2005. For more detailed discussion, see

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, beginning on page
App.-A-30 of the Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

Employees

The number of employees, excluding temporary employees, at December 31, 2007, was 26,851, all of
whom were employed by subsidiaries of The Progressive Corporation.

Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

The consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss
adjustment expenses (LAE) of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries. Our objective is to ensure that
total reserves (i.e., case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves, or “IBNR”) are adequate
to cover all loss costs, while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially
established until losses are fully developed. The liabilities for losses and LAE are determined
using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net
cost of all unpaid losses and LAE incurred through December 31 of each year. These estimates are
subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement, among other factors. These estimates
are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.
Such adjustments, if any, are reflected in the current results of operations. A detailed
discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “Report on Loss Reserving
Practices,” which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 8-K on June
28, 2007, as well as in the “Critical Accounting Policies” section of our

During 2007 we experienced $80.3 million of unfavorable loss reserve development, compared to
favorable development of $246.9 million and $355.9 million, in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
unfavorable development in 2007 was due to settlement of some large outstanding litigation, the
number of large losses emerging from prior accident years being more than anticipated plus the
result of reviews of large bodily injury and uninsured motorist claims. The favorable development
in 2006 and 2005 was driven by actuarial adjustments, resulting from regularly scheduled actuarial
reviews, as well as favorable “all other development” (e.g., claims settling for more or less than
reserved, emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than reserved and changes in reserve
estimates by claims representatives). The favorable “all other development” also reflected the
continued recognition of lower severity for prior accident years than had been previously
estimated. We conduct extensive reviews each month on portions of our business to help ensure that
we are meeting our objective of having reserves that are adequate, with minimal variation.

In establishing loss reserves, we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by
anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policies
written. These severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated
changes in underwriting standards, inflation, policy provisions and general economic trends. These
anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if
necessary.

We have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material
effect on earnings or reserves.

Represents loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses at
the balance sheet date.


Cumulative development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and LAE — Net.

The above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and LAE from 1997
through 2006. The top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE
recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the property-casualty
insurance subsidiaries only. This liability represents the



estimated amount of losses and LAE for
claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date, including IBNR. The table also presents the
re-estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE on a gross basis, with separate disclosure of the
re-estimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses.

The upper section of the table (labeled “Paid (Cumulative) as of:”) shows the cumulative amount
paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year. The
lower portion of the table (labeled “Liability Re-estimated as of:”) shows the re-estimated amount
of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year.
The re-estimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for
occurrences prior to the reserve date. The estimate is increased or decreased as more information
about the claims becomes known for individual years. For example, as of December 31, 2007, our
insurance subsidiaries had paid $1.90 billion of the currently estimated $1.93 billion of losses
and LAE that had been unpaid at the end of 1998; thus, an estimated $28.2 million of losses
incurred through 1998 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date.

The net cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all
prior years. For example, the 1997 liability has developed favorably by $186.7 million over ten
years. That amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on
the income in calendar year 1998. The effects on income during the past three years due to changes
in estimates of the liabilities for losses and LAE are shown in the reconciliation table on page 9
as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and LAE.

In evaluating this information, note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects
of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods. For example, the amount of
the development related to losses settled in 2007, but incurred in 2004, will be included in the
cumulative development amount for years 2004, 2005 and 2006. Conditions and trends that have
affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future.
Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table.

We experienced significant favorable reserve development through the mid-1990’s until 1997,
primarily due to decreasing bodily injury severity, while the carried reserves anticipated an
increasing severity. From 1998 through 2001, we experienced an increase in bodily injury severity
and, as a result, saw our reserve development much closer to our original estimates. The bodily
injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2002 and 2006. As a result, the
reserve run-off for these years was very favorable. In 2007, the realization of higher prior
years’ severity than anticipated resulted in our reserves developing unfavorably by 1.5%. Not only
did this development impact 2006, but also impacted the run-off of most of the past year-end
reserves. In 2007, the estimated severity for accident years 2005 and 2006 was higher than our
estimated severity at the end of 2006 by 1.0% and .7%, respectively, for our personal auto products
and by 4.0% and 7.7% for our commercial auto products.

Although
the detail is not presented in the table on page 10, we also
re-estimate the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses. The top of
the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid
losses we had at the end of the calendar year, while the bottom shows
the reserves re-estimated based on development in subsequent years.
For example, at December 31, 2006, we estimated our reinsurance
recoverables on unpaid losses to be $361.4 million. During 2007,
these reserves developed unfavorably by $3.7 million, bringing the
re-estimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to $365.1
million, as shown at the bottom of the table.

Schedule P, Part-1, from the Consolidated Annual Statements of Progressive’s insurance
subsidiaries, as filed with the state insurance departments.

Our Web site is located at progressive.com. As soon as reasonably practicable, we make all

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in
this section. Management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may
affect our ability to achieve our business objectives:

•

Operating Risks

are those stemming from external or internal events or circumstances
that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations.

•

Investing Risks

are uncertainties relating to the performance and preservation of our
investment portfolios. Unlike most other risks, the actual development of an investment
risk factor (such as interest rates going down or up) may result in either an increase or
decrease in the value of investments we hold.

•

Financing Risks

generally relate to our ability to obtain capital, when necessary, to
pay or otherwise perform our obligations, including obligations under any debt instruments
issued, and to earn the cost of equity capital.

Although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below,
it should be noted that many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. For
example, although presented as an Operating Risk below, state regulation of insurance companies may
also affect our investing and financing activities. Similarly, while setting insurance rates,
establishing loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as Operating Risks, errors
in these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well. The
categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks
facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed.

This information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in
this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the SEC, as well as news
releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time.

Additional
risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may
also adversely affect our business. If any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following
risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, this could have a materially adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. In that case, the market
price of our common shares could decline materially.

I.

Operating Risks

We compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly
competitive.

We face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national companies and smaller regional
insurers. Other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also
may enter these markets in the future. Many of these companies may have greater financial,
marketing and management resources than we have. In addition, competitors may offer consumers
combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not
offer. We could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business, or to retain a
sufficient percentage of our current customers, as a result of competitors offering similar
insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor
initiatives.

In recent years, the highly competitive nature of the automobile insurance industry has been
evidenced, in part, by declining premium rates for many consumers, including our own recent rate
reductions. Among other factors, these price decreases have been driven primarily by decreasing
frequency trends (i.e., less accidents per insurance policy), which have not been fully offset by
increases in severity (i.e., amounts paid per accident). This very competitive environment has in
turn resulted in lower operating income and revenue growth rates for us. We cannot predict whether
these trends will continue, but if they do, our growth rates at a 96 combined ratio may become
pressured.



From time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive
position in auto insurance markets. Based on a culture that encourages innovation, these
strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors’, then-current
or historical modes of doing business. As such, our innovations may entail a degree of risk and
may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals. In addition, these initiatives may be
subject to challenge by regulators or private litigants and may disrupt our relationships with
certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). If we are unable successfully
to develop, plan and implement our strategic initiatives in these competitive, regulatory and legal
environments, or if we are unable to identify effective strategies in the first instance to
maintain or enhance our competitive position, our business could be materially adversely affected.

Similarly, we undertake distinctive advertising campaigns, and other efforts to improve brand
recognition, generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers. If these
campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, our business
could be materially adversely affected. We believe that improving the effectiveness of our
advertising campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the
recent increases in advertising and marketing efforts within the automobile insurance market.

The highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure
of one or more major competitors. In the event of a failure of a major insurer, we could be
adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under
state-mandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer, and we could be faced with an
unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders.

Our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers and executives, and to
maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success.

Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, including
executives and other key managers. Our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure
to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect
on our business.

In addition, we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments (for
multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our
hiring programs and employment levels accordingly. Our failure to recognize the need for such
adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead
either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing
(impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or
locations. In either such event, our financial results and customer relationships could be
materially adversely affected.

We further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve
the staffing models and employee culture that we have developed over the years. Our ability to do
so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, legislation or regulations at the state or
federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace. In such events, the productivity of
certain of our workers could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating
performance and margins.

The Progressive Corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex
federal and state laws and regulations.

Progressive’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. Our insurance
subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50
states and the District of Columbia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and
regulations. In addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses,
including insurers. Our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations
at reasonable costs, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will
continue to be critical to our success.

Certain states impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by
regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate,
innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. Our compliance efforts are
further complicated by changes in laws or regulations
applicable to insurance companies (such as, in recent years, legislative and regulatory initiatives
concerning the



use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit
scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze, set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit
the rate of return that an insurance company may earn). Insurance laws and regulations may limit
our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our
subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict
our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets or
prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances. In addition, compliance
with insurance-related laws and regulations often results in increased administrative costs to our
insurance subsidiaries. These costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our
ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions.

The failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or the alleged failure to so comply, by us
or other companies in the insurance, financial services or related industries, also could result in
actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general or other law enforcement
officials. For example, in recent years, several states have included us in document and
information requests relating to investigations into the relationships between insurers and brokers
and agents, allegations of bid rigging by certain brokers and related matters, although we have not
been notified that we are the target of any such investigation. Such actions and investigations,
and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could
potentially lead to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the
marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or
more jurisdictions. In addition, The Progressive Corporation and its subsidiaries could face
individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of
certain of these laws or regulations.

New legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our
operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states. In addition, from time
to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition
of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. We are unable to
predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations
would affect our businesses.

State insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for Progressive’s insurance
subsidiaries in other ways as well. For further information on these risks and uncertainties, see
the “Insurance Regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report.

Lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are
pending and more may be filed in the future.

The Progressive Corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in putative class
action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations, and
such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. These
lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of after-market parts;
total loss evaluation methodology; use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the
federal Fair Credit Reporting Act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury,
personal injury protection and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures;
interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; and policy implementation and renewal
procedures, among other matters. From time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other
disputes alleging that our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent,
trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Additional litigation may be
filed against us concerning our employment-related practices, medical malpractice and other general
liability causes of action arising from our operations. In addition, lawsuits have been filed, and
other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and
although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional
risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries’ business
operations.

Lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. Moreover, as courts resolve
individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields, a new layer of court-imposed
regulation could emerge, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business.

Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Except to the extent we have established reserves with
respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the
effect, if any, that these pending or
future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability or financial condition. For
further information



on pending litigation, see

Note 11 — Litigation

, beginning on page App.-A-24 of
the Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

Our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to
policyholders.

Our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite
and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. The role of the pricing function is to
ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses, loss adjustment
expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit.

Pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the
projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, for each of our products in multiple
risk tiers and many different markets. As a result, our ability to price accurately is subject to
a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:

The realization of such risks may result in our pricing being based on stale, inadequate or
inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions or methodologies, and may cause us to
estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, we could
underprice risks, which would negatively affect our margins, or we could overprice risks, which
could reduce our volume and competitiveness. In either event, our operating results, financial
condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, underpricing
insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance
subsidiaries, constraining our ability to write new business.

Our growth trends have been and could continue to be impacted by reduced accident frequency trends.

Auto accident frequency has steadily declined since 2000. Although not conclusive, several
contributors to reduced frequency include improved vehicle safety, road design and driver education
as well as the increased price of gasoline which, along with other factors, may affect consumers’
driving habits. These frequency trends have led us, and most competitors, to lower our insurance
premiums, which in turn has adversely impacted our recent premium growth rates. We are not able to
predict whether frequency will continue to decline, stabilize or return to increasing trends more
consistent with the periods prior to 2000. If the recent trend continues, however, declining auto
accident frequency, if not offset by an increase in severity, could continue to pressure premium
growth rates and potentially lead to a long-term reduction in the amount of premiums written in the
auto insurance industry, thus directly affecting our ability to grow our auto insurance business
revenues.

Our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims
accurately.

Our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts
that the subsidiaries will ultimately pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs
of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. There is inherent
uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves, which can arise
from a number of factors, including:

•

the availability of sufficient reliable data,

•

the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity
trends in multiple markets,



As a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss
adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses
and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements.
Consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially
adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position. Further information
on our loss reserves can be found in the “Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss
Adjustment Expenses” discussion beginning on page 8 of this report, as well as our “Report on Loss
Reserving Practices,” which was filed with the SEC on Form 8-K on June 28, 2007.

Likewise, we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many
factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience and
skill of our claims representatives, the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of our
management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies and
systems to support our claims functions and the success of our concierge-level claims services
program. Our failure to pay claims accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to
material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair
our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our financial results, prospects and
liquidity.

Our financial performance may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or
other catastrophic losses.

Catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms,
earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions,
terrorist attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages or
interruptions of communications facilities. The extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a
function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature
and severity of the event. In addition, our business could be further impaired if a significant
portion of our business or systems were shut down by, or if we were unable to gain access to
certain of our facilities as a result of, such an event. Most of our past catastrophe-related
claims have resulted from severe storms, as evidenced recently by the active hurricane seasons in
2004 and 2005. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. When they
occur with enough severity, our financial performance, cash flows and results of operations could
be materially adversely affected.

Our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business
functions, including our information technology and other business systems.

Our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform, in an efficient and
uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as Internet support and 24-hour call
centers, processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims. A shut-down of, or
inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage, or a failure of one or more of
our information technology, telecommunications or other systems for any reason, including failures
that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded, could significantly impair our
ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. In addition, because our information
technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we
could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party
system fails or experiences an interruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business
interruption, system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to
write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely
manner or perform other necessary business functions. This could result in a materially adverse
effect on our business results, prospects and liquidity.



A security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations, subject us
to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated, and significantly damage our
reputation. Despite the implementation of security measures, including hiring an independent firm
to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems, these systems may be vulnerable
to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties
or similar disruptive problems. Any compromise of security could deter people from entering into
transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a
material, adverse effect on our business.

We rely heavily on credit card acceptance for premium payment and settlement of claims deductibles.
Data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are
prescribed by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI), an independent body formed by an
association of the major credit card vendors. These standards are intended to promote a common set
of data security measures to help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information by companies
accepting credit card payments. At year end 2007, an independent organization recognized by PCI
for such purposes certified Progressive as being in compliance with the current PCI standards. The
PCI data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment
security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and recertification
of our processes.  Our
intention is to maintain compliance with PCI’s data security
standards. The failure to do so could result in contractual fines or
disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments.

II.

Investing Risks

The performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to investment
risks.

Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including:

•

Interest rate risk

— the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income
securities as a result of increases in the market interest rates, which is the most
significant risk to the fixed-income portfolio.

•

Credit risk

— the risk that the value of certain investments may become impaired
due to the deterioration in financial condition of one or more issuers of those instruments
and, ultimately, the risk of permanent loss in the event of default by an issuer.

•

Concentration risk

— the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated
in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries, which could result in a
significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the
financial condition, performance or outlook of those issuers, sectors or industries.

•

Prepayment or extension risk

(applicable to certain securities in the portfolio,
such as residential mortgage-backed securities) — the risk that, as interest rates change,
the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, adversely affecting
the value of or income from such securities and the portfolio.

The common equity portfolio, which is managed to track the Russell 1000 index, is subject to
general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the
securities we hold. Equity markets and individual securities may be subject to periods of high
volatility. A decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be
expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio.

In addition, both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are subject to risks inherent
in the nation’s and world’s capital markets. The functioning of those markets, the values of the
investments we hold and our ability to liquidate investments on favorable terms on short notice may
be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by local, national or
international events, such as power outages, system failures, wars or terrorist attacks, recessions
or depressions, a significant change in inflation expectations, a significant devaluation of
governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events.



If the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to be impaired by market, sector or
issuer-specific conditions to a substantial degree, our liquidity, financial position and financial
results could be materially adversely affected. Under these circumstances, our income from these
investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could
further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. A decrease in value of an insurance
company’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy
regulatory minimum capital requirements. If we, at that time, are unable to supplement the
subsidiary’s capital from The Progressive Corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity
securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected.

See

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations

, beginning on page
App.-A-30 of the Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, for additional
discussion on current market risk associated with our investment portfolio.

III.

Financing Risks

Our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the
holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to
shareholders, repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or
affiliate.

The Progressive Corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own.
Consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to The
Progressive Corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, Progressive may be unable to pay
dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations,
repurchase its common shares, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries
or affiliate. Each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be
limited by one or more of the following factors:

•

State insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified
minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus.

•

State regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net
income or surplus availability of the insurance company.

•

Competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength
ratings.

•

In certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from state regulatory authorities
for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated
entities, including the holding company.

Further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our
insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in Item 5(c), “Dividends,” beginning on page
21 of this report.

The Progressive Corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to
shareholders each year, and the dividend program may ultimately be changed.

We have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis
under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor (set
by the Board of Directors for each of 2007 and 2008 at 20%) and then
by the Gainshare factor
(determined under our employee Gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of
our principal insurance businesses). To the extent our comprehensive income, which includes net
investment income and realized and unrealized gains and losses, is less than after-tax underwriting
income, no dividend will be payable. For 2007, this calculation resulted in a dividend payment of
$.145 per share, which was paid on January 31, 2008.

Because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any
particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps
significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). As a result, the amount paid may be
inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations. In addition, although we have announced our
intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2008 (to be paid early in 2009), the dividend will not be
declared by the Board until December 2008, and the Board could decide to alter our policy or not to
pay the annual dividend for 2008 or future years. Such an action by the Board could result from,
among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital
needs, changes in federal income tax laws, or disruptions of national or international capital
markets or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under
“Investing Risks.” Any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company
and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our stock.



Our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into
significant contracts becomes insolvent or experiences other financial hardship.

Our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under
various contractual relationships. These include, for example, contracts for the acquisitions of
goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support,
and other services that are integral to our operations), joint marketing arrangements and
arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection
with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). If one or more of
these parties were to default on the performance of their obligations under their respective
contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product or service that is
significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses and operational problems,
which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows or results of operations
and damage to our reputation.

If we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our
ability to grow could be adversely affected.

We intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to
support the growth of our insurance businesses, and to provide for additional protection against
possible large, unexpected losses. The level of capital that is retained at any time is determined
by management based, in part, on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects, and
estimates of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a
confidence level prescribed by management. The amount of capital that we maintain is driven by our
assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing and operating
risks, including those discussed in these Risk Factors. The estimates for unexpected events are
internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types of risks
that we are likely to face. While our techniques for our capital needs are continually enhanced,
our ability to predict accurately the nature, size and scope of unexpected events is inherently
uncertain. If our capital level turns out to be lower than the amount needed at a given time, our
financial condition could be materially adversely affected, our ability to grow the insurance
business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are found, and our ability to
gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted.

Our access to capital markets, our financing arrangements and our business operations are dependent
on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies.

Our credit and financial strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as
Standard & Poor’s (AA+), Moody’s Investors Service (Aa2) and A.M. Best (A+, with one company rated
A). Progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings.
Downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets
and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our
current indebtedness would not be affected). Perceptions of our company by investors, producers,
other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired. Downgrades in the ratings of
our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting
in lower or negative premium growth. In either event, our financial performance could be
materially adversely affected.

We do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value
of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results.

We believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the
financial goals and policies that we establish each year. We do not manage our business to maximize
short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend paid under our annual variable dividend
policy. We also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings
estimates by analysts. As a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps
significantly, from investors’ expectations, which could result in significant volatility in our
stock price.

In addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business
strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance
our longer-term position, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit
short-term performance, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. Such
strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers to
support growth or enhance retention of current customers. Consequently, these strategies may
adversely affect short-term performance and may result in additional volatility in our stock price.



ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

We currently do not have any unresolved comments from the SEC staff.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

All of our properties are owned or leased by subsidiaries of The Progressive Corporation.
Progressive’s corporate headquarters are located on a 42-acre parcel in Mayfield Village, Ohio. We
also have a 72-acre corporate office complex near the headquarters. Buildings on these two sites
contain approximately 1.6 million square feet of office space.

We also own: seven other buildings in Cleveland, Ohio suburbs near the corporate office complexes;
four buildings in Tampa, Florida; five buildings in Colorado Springs, Colorado; and a building in
each of the following cities: Albany, New York; Ft. Lauderdale, Florida; Plymouth Meeting,
Pennsylvania; Tempe, Arizona; and Tigard, Oregon. Two of these buildings are partially leased to
non-affiliates. In total, these buildings contain approximately 2.0 million square feet of office,
warehouse and training facility space. These facilities are occupied by our business units or
other supporting operations and are not segregated by industry segment.

We own 37 buildings and lease another 16 to provide concierge-level claims service at various
locations throughout the United States. In addition, the building in Tempe, Arizona is also
partially used as a claims service center. In total, these additional buildings contain
approximately .8 million square feet. We will continue to expand this service into 2008 and 2009,
with approximately 5 new sites expected to be opened, of which 3 sites will replace existing leased
facilities.

We lease approximately 1.2 million square feet of office and warehouse space at various locations
throughout the United States for our business units and corporate functions. In addition, we lease
approximately 475 claims offices, consisting of approximately 3.5 million square feet, at various
locations throughout the United States. These leases are generally short-term to medium-term
leases of standard commercial office space.

The closing price of our Common Shares on January 31, 2008, was $18.55.

(b) Holders

There were 3,857 shareholders of record on January 31, 2008.

(c) Dividends

See the table above for the frequency and amount of cash dividends paid on our Common Shares, $1.00
par value, for the last two years.

During 2006, Progressive’s Board of Directors approved a plan to replace our previous quarterly
dividend policy with an annual variable dividend beginning in 2007. The annual variable dividend
will be based on a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a target
percentage factor and then by a companywide performance factor (known as our Gainshare factor).
For 2007 and 2008, the Board determined the target percentage of after-tax underwriting income to
be 20%. The Gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing operating
performance for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives. The
Gainshare factor is also used in connection with our cash bonus program for employees and is
approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board annually. To the extent the Gainshare factor
was zero or if comprehensive income (which includes net investment income as well as both realized
gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses during
the period) was less than
after-tax underwriting income, no annual variable dividend would be paid. In addition, although
it is our intent to calculate an annual dividend based on the formula
outlined, the Board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay
the annual dividend for 2008 or future years, at any time prior to
the declaration of the dividend for the year. Such an action by the
Board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the
insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs,
changes in federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or
international capital markets or other events affecting our business,
liquidity or financial position. In 2007, the Board declared a dividend of $.1450 per common share.



In
June 2007, the Board also declared an extraordinary cash dividend of $2.00 per common share. The
extraordinary dividend was part of a plan to restructure our capital position during the year and
is described in

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, beginning on page
App.-A-30 of the Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

To the extent we elect to defer the payment of interest on our 6.70% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior
Subordinated Debentures due 2067, we may be restricted from declaring any dividends. See

Note 4 —
Debt

beginning on page App.-A-15 of the Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K for
further discussion. Our intent is to pay interest on the Debentures as and when due.

Consolidated statutory policyholders’ surplus was $4.6 billion on December 31, 2007, and $5.0
billion on December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, $470.2 million of consolidated statutory
policyholders’ surplus represented net admitted assets of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and
affiliate that are required to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements in such entities’ states
of domicile. Generally, the net admitted assets of insurance companies that, subject to other
applicable insurance laws and regulations, are available for transfer to the parent company cannot
include the net admitted assets required to meet the minimum statutory surplus requirements of the
states where the companies are licensed. The companies may be licensed in states other than their
states of domicile, however, which may have higher minimum statutory surplus requirements. Based
on the dividend laws currently in effect, the insurance subsidiaries may pay aggregate dividends of
$974.6 million in 2008 without prior approval from regulatory authorities, provided the dividend
payments are not within 12 months of previous dividends paid by the applicable subsidiary.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The
accompanying condensed financial statements of The Progressive
Corporation (parent company) should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of The Progressive
Corporation and subsidiaries’ Annual Report to Shareholders, which is
included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

Note 1.
Statements of Cash Flows

— For the purpose of the Statements of Cash Flows, cash includes
only bank demand deposits. The Progressive Corporation does not hold any cash but has unrestricted
access to funds maintained in a non-insurance, investment subsidiary to meet its holding company
obligations. The Progressive Corporation paid income taxes of $526.0 million in 2007, $739.0
million in 2006 and $767.0 million in 2005, respectively. Total interest paid was $110.1 million
in 2007, $81.3 million in 2006 and $85.0 million in 2005. Non-cash activity includes declared but
unpaid dividends, the liability for deferred restricted stock compensation (prior to the adoption
of SFAS 123(R)) and the contribution from The Progressive Corporation of its common shares to
certain subsidiaries, subject to restricted stock awards granted to employees.

The Progressive Corporation effected a 4-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend to
shareholders on May 18, 2006. We reflected the issuance of the additional common shares by
transferring $585.9 million from retained earnings to the common stock account. All share, per
share and equivalent share amounts and stock prices were adjusted to give effect to the split.
Treasury shares were not split.

Note 2. Income Taxes

— The Progressive Corporation files a consolidated federal income tax return
with all subsidiaries and acts as an agent for the consolidated tax group when making payments to
the Internal Revenue Service. Income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Balance Sheets are
comprised of the parent company’s net deferred tax assets offset by the consolidated group’s net
income taxes payable/recoverable. The Progressive Corporation and its subsidiaries have adopted,
pursuant to a written agreement, a method of allocating consolidated Federal income taxes. Amounts
allocated to the subsidiaries under the written agreement are
included in “Intercompany Receivable”
in the accompanying Condensed Balance Sheets.

Note 3. Investment in Consolidated Subsidiaries

— The Progressive Corporation, through its
investment in consolidated subsidiaries, recognizes the changes in unrealized gains (losses) on
available-for-sale securities of the subsidiaries. These amounts were:
