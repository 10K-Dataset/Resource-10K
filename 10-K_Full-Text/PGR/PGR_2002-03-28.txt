PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

(a)  General Development of Business

The Progressive insurance organization began business in 1937. The Progressive
Corporation, an insurance holding company formed in 1965, has 73 subsidiaries,
1 mutual insurance company affiliate and 1 reciprocal insurance company
affiliate. The Progressive Corporation’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliates
provide personal automobile insurance and other specialty property-casualty
insurance and related services throughout the United States. The Company’s
property-casualty insurance products protect its customers against collision
and physical damage to their motor vehicles and liability to others for
personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those vehicles.

(b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments

Incorporated by reference from Note 8, Segment Information, on page 42 of
the Company’s Annual Report to Shareholders, which is included as Exhibit 13 to
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business

The Company offers a number of personal and commercial property-casualty
insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles. Net premiums written
were $7,260.1 million in 2001, compared to $6,196.1 million in 2000 and
$6,124.7 million in 1999. The underwriting profit was 4.8% in 2001, compared
to an underwriting loss of 4.4% in 2000 and an underwriting profit of 1.7% in
1999.

Personal Lines

The Company’s Personal Lines segment writes insurance for private passenger
automobiles and recreation and other vehicles. This business frequently offers
more than one program in a single state, with each targeted to a specific
market or customer group. Personal Lines accounted for 89% of total net
premiums written in 2001, compared to 91% in 2000 and 93% in 1999. The
Company’s strategy is to become the low-cost provider of a full line of auto
insurance products and related services, distributed through whichever channel
the customer prefers.

Of the approximately 220 United States insurance company groups writing private
passenger auto insurance, the Company ranked fourth in size for 2000 based on
direct premiums written and estimates that it held this position for 2001. For
2001, the estimated industry net premiums written, which include personal auto
insurance in the United States, were $125.1 billion, and the Company’s share of
this market was approximately 5.2%, compared to $119.6 billion and 4.7%,
respectively, in 2000, and $118.6 billion and 4.8% in 1999. Except as
otherwise noted, all industry data and the Company’s market share or ranking in
the industry were derived either directly from data reported by A.M. Best
Company Inc. (“A.M. Best”) or were estimated using A.M. Best data as the
primary source.

Private passenger automobile insurance is comprised of preferred, standard and
nonstandard automobile risks. Standard and preferred automobile risks account
for about 80% of the United States’ personal automobile insurance market. The
remaining 20% of the market is comprised of nonstandard auto risks. The
Company actively participates in the market for each of these risks, with the
objective of offering a competitive rate for all risks. Volume potential is
driven by


the Company’s ability to price competitively, brand recognition, and the
actions of the Company’s competitors, among other factors. See “Competitive Factors” on page 8 of
this report for further discussion.

The Company’s specialty Personal Lines products include insurance for
motorcycles, recreation vehicles, mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles and
similar items. The Company’s competitors are specialty companies and large
multi-line insurance carriers. Although industry figures are not available,
based on the Company’s analysis of this market, the Company believes that it is
one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market.
The Company has been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since
1998.

In March 2002, the Company determined that it will discontinue writing new
homeowner’s insurance in all states effective May 3, 2002. This action was
taken because the homeowner’s product did not meet the Company’s goal of
attracting more standard and preferred auto business by packaging a
homeowner’s product with its auto product. The Company sells the homeowner’s
product in Arizona, Michigan, Maryland and Illinois through a select number of
independent agents. For 2001, the homeowner's product accounted for
less than one-tenth of one percent of Personal Lines’ premiums
written. To minimize the overall exposure, the Company reinsures
this risk through a 75% quota share agreement under which the Company has a 25%
net retention.

The Personal Lines business is generated either by an Agent or written directly
by the Company. The Agent channel includes business written by the Company’s
network of more than 30,000 Independent Insurance Agencies, located throughout
the United States, and through strategic alliance business relationships. The
Independent Insurance Agencies have the authority to bind the Company to
specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines,
subject to compliance with certain Company-mandated procedures. These
guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and
the premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk. The
Agencies do not have authority on behalf of the Company to settle or adjust
claims, establish underwriting guidelines, develop rates or enter into other
transactions or commitments. The Agent channel also establishes alliances with
other insurance companies, financial institutions, employers and national
brokerage agencies. In 2001, the total net premiums written through the Agent
channel represented 71% of the Personal Lines volume, compared to 77% in 2000
and 83% in 1999. Direct business includes business written through
1-800-PROGRESSIVE

SM

, over the Internet (progressive.com) and on behalf of
affinity groups. Net premiums written in the Direct business were 29%, 23% and
17% of the Personal Lines volume in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Auto insurance differs greatly by community because regulations and legal
decisions vary by state and because traffic, law enforcement, cultural
attitudes, insurance agents, medical services and auto repair services vary by
community. The Company’s organization enables it to meet varied local
conditions under a cohesive set of policies and procedures designed to provide
consistency and control. The Company’s business is organized into business
areas: Agent, Direct (which includes the Internet business), Claims, and Sales
and Service. The Agent, Direct and Claims business areas are managed at a
local level and structured into six regions. Each business has a Group
President and a process team, with local managers at the state or regional
level. Sales and Service (such as customer service calls, direct sales calls
and claims loss reporting) is performed at six regional sites in Austin, Texas;
Cleveland, Ohio; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Sacramento, California; Tampa,
Florida; and Tempe, Arizona.

The Company’s executive management team, which sets policy and makes key strategic
decisions, includes the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief
Legal Officer, Chief Information Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer. The
Company’s four Group Presidents (Agent, Direct, Claims, and Sales and Service)
are also part of the executive team. The Group Presidents are challenged to
develop and manage product offerings and customer service processes tailored to
the unique requirements of customers who discover and select Progressive
through different distribution modes.


Other Businesses

The Company’s other lines of business include the Commercial Vehicle business
unit, Lenders’ Collateral Protection Group (LCPG), Professional Liability Group
(PLG) and Motor Carrier business unit, which are organized by customer group
and headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. These businesses accounted for
approximately 9% of total revenue in 2001. The choice of distribution channel
is driven by each customer group’s buying preference and service needs.
Distribution channels include independent agents, financial institutions,
vehicle dealers and company-employed sales forces. Distribution arrangements
are individually negotiated between such intermediaries and the Company and are
tailored to the specific needs of the customer group and the nature of the
related financial or purchase transactions.

The Commercial Vehicle business unit provides monoline insurance which covers
automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses for primary liability,
physical damage and other supplementary insurance coverages. The Commercial Vehicle business
unit is currently operating in a market where average premiums are increasing. Based on the
Company’s analysis of this market, the Company competes for this business on a
nationwide basis with approximately 150 other companies. The Company estimates
that it is one of the largest monoline commercial auto carriers.

LCPG primarily provides physical damage insurance and related tracking services
to protect the commercial or retail lender’s interest in collateral which is
not otherwise insured against these risks. The principal product offered is
collateral protection insurance for automobile lenders, which is sold to
financial institutions and/or their customers. Commercial banks and finance companies are LCPG’s
largest customer group for these services. This business also serves savings
and loan institutions, finance companies and credit unions. According to the
Company’s analysis, this market as well as the Company’s share of the market, are declining in size.

PLG’s principal customers are community banks. Its principal products are
liability insurance for directors and officers and employee dishonesty
insurance. Progressive shares the risk and premium on these coverages with a
small mutual reinsurer controlled by its bank customers and various other
reinsurance entities. The program is sponsored by the American Bankers
Association. Additionally, the Company provides similar coverages for credit
unions and savings and loan institutions. The risk and premium on these
coverages are also reinsured by various reinsurance entities. PLG represented
less than one-half percent of the Company’s total 2001 net premiums written.

The Motor Carrier business unit primarily processes business for Commercial
Auto Insurance Procedures (CAIP), which are state supervised plans serving the
involuntary markets. The Motor Carrier business unit processes CAIP business
in 26 states. As a CAIP servicing carrier, this business unit processes over
50% of the premiums in the CAIP market, which is growing in size, and assumes no indemnity risk. The Company
competes with two other providers nationwide.

Risk Factors

The Company’s business involves various risks and uncertainties. Information
regarding certain of those risks and uncertainties is set forth below. This
information should be considered carefully together with the other information
contained herein and in the other reports and materials filed by the Company
with the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC"), as well as news releases and other
information publicly disseminated by the Company from time to time.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the
Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company
or that it currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the
Company’s business. If any of the following risks or uncertainties develop
into actual events, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
business, financial condition or results of operations. In that case, the
trading price of the Company’s Common Shares could decline materially.

Competition.

The automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets in
which the Company operates are highly competitive. Property-casualty insurers
compete on the basis of price, consumer recognition, coverage offered, claims
handling, financial stability, customer service and geographic coverage.
Vigorous competition is provided by large, well-capitalized national companies,
some of which have greater financial, marketing and management resources than


the Company, and by smaller regional insurers. The Company could be adversely
affected by a loss of business to
competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices and other
competitor initiatives. See the “Competitive Factors” discussion on page 8 of
this report for further information.

Insurance Regulation.

The insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and
supervision by various state insurance departments. Certain regulatory
restrictions, and prior approval requirements, may affect the subsidiaries’
ability to operate, innovate, obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely
manner, pay dividends to the parent company and grow their businesses in a
profitable manner.

Regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues arise.
In recent years, legislation and voter initiatives have been introduced which
deal with use of nonpublic consumer information, use of credit in underwriting,
rate determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew insurance
policies, reflecting concerns about consumer privacy, coverage, availability,
prices and alleged discriminatory pricing. Moreover, new legislation or regulations
may adversely affect the Company’s ability to underwrite and price risks
accurately and, thus, underwriting results, as well as the Company’s ability to
write business profitably in one or more states, in which event the Company may
seek to reduce its writings in or to withdraw entirely from those states. In
addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal
agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to
determine whether federal regulation is necessary. The Company is unable to predict
whether and to what extent new laws and regulations that would affect the
Company’s business will be adopted in the future, the timing of any such
adoption and what effects, if any, they may have on the Company’s operations,
profitability and financial condition.

In some states, the automobile insurance industry has been under pressure in
past years from regulators, legislators or special interest groups to reduce,
freeze or set rates to or at levels that are not necessarily related to
underlying costs, including initiatives to roll back automobile and other
personal lines rates. This kind of activity has adversely affected, and may in
the future adversely affect, the profitability and growth of the subsidiaries’
automobile insurance business in those jurisdictions, and may limit the
subsidiaries’ ability to increase rates to compensate for increases in costs.
Adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the subsidiaries’ ability
to price automobile insurance adequately may occur in the future. The impact
of these regulatory changes on the subsidiaries’ businesses cannot be
predicted.

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a
market. For example, certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to
cancel and non-renew policies. Further, certain states prohibit an insurer
from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant
to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state
insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption.
Laws and regulations that limit cancellations and non-renewals or that subject
program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s
ability to exit unprofitable markets.

State insurance regulation may effect and create risk and uncertainties for the
Company’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. For further
information on these risks and uncertainties, see the “Insurance Regulation”
discussion beginning on page 8 of this report.

Restrictions on Dividends.

The Progressive Corporation is a holding company
with no business operations of its own. Consequently, its ability to pay
dividends to shareholders and meet its debt payment obligations is largely
dependent on dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries. If the
Company’s subsidiaries are unable to make payments to the holding company, or
are able to pay only limited amounts, the Company may be unable to pay
dividends to shareholders or make payments on its indebtedness. State insurance
regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified levels
of statutory capital and surplus. In addition, competitive pressures require
the Company’s subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings. Prior
regulatory approval from state regulatory authorities may be required in order
for its insurance subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends or make other
distributions to affiliated entities. Further information on state insurance
laws and regulations which may limit the ability of the Company’s insurance
subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in Item 5(c), “Subsidiary Dividends,” on
page 17 of this report.

Class Actions and Other Litigation.

The Company is named as a defendant in a
number of putative class actions and other lawsuits, such as those alleging
damages as a result of the Company’s use of after-market parts, total loss
evaluation methodology, use of credit in underwriting and offering alternative
commission programs, the alleged diminution of value to vehicles which are
involved in accidents or the Company’s classification of employees under


federal and state wage and hour laws and cases challenging other aspects of the
Company’s business operations, including claims and marketing practices. Other
litigation may be filed against the Company in the future. Litigation, by its
very nature, is unpredictable and the outcome of these cases is uncertain.
Further, the Company is unable to
predict the precise nature of or the relief that may be sought in any lawsuits
that may be filed against the Company in the future or the effect that these
pending or future cases may have on the business, operations, profitability or
financial condition of the Company. For further information on pending
litigation, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” beginning on page 15 of this report.

Underwriting Accuracy and Rate Adequacy.

The Company’s operating performance
and financial condition depend on the Company’s ability to underwrite and set
rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. Rate adequacy is necessary to
generate sufficient premium to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses and
underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price accurately, the
Company must collect and analyze a substantial volume of data; develop, test
and apply appropriate rating formulae; closely monitor and timely recognize
changes in trend; and project both severity and frequency with reasonable
accuracy. If the Company fails to assess accurately the risks that it assumes
or does not accurately estimate its retention (i.e. policy life expectancy),
the Company may fail to establish adequate premium rates, which could reduce
income and have a material adverse effect on its operating results or financial
condition.

Changes in the frequency and severity of claims may have an impact on the
profitability of the Company’s business. Changing driving patterns affect both
the frequency and severity of claims in the private passenger auto insurance
business. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by
inflation in the medical sector of the economy. Changes in auto physical
damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs,
auto parts prices and used car prices.

Weather Conditions; Catastrophic Losses.

The Company continues to be exposed
to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes. Catastrophes
can be caused by various events, including natural events such as
hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires, and other
events such as an explosion, a terrorist attack and riots. The incidence and
severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses
from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure
in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most
catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however,
hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms and earthquakes may produce significant damage over large, heavily
populated areas. Most of the Company’s past catastrophe-related claims have
resulted from severe storms. Although the occurrence of a major catastrophe
could have a significant impact on the Company’s quarterly results, the Company
believes that, except under extraordinary circumstances, such an event would
not be so material as to disrupt the overall normal operations of the Company
or have a material impact on the financial condition of the Company.

Loss Reserves.

There is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property and casualty loss reserves. Reserves are estimates based on actuarial
and statistical projections at a given point in time of what the Company
ultimately expects to pay out on claims and the cost of adjusting those claims,
based on facts and circumstances then known. Factors affecting these projections include changes in medical costs, repair costs and regulation.

Ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps
substantially, from point-in-time estimates of reserves contained in the
Company’s financial statements. The Company’s actual claim payments may
exceed its claim reserves causing the Company to incur losses the Company did
not anticipate. If the Company’s losses exceed its reserves, its earnings may
be significantly and negatively affected. This uncertainty arises from a
number of factors, including the difficulty in predicting the rate of inflation
and the rate and direction of changes in trend, ongoing interpretation of
insurance policy provisions by courts, inconsistent decisions in lawsuits
regarding coverage and expanded theories of liability. In addition, ongoing
changes in claim settlement practices can lead to changes in loss payment
patterns which are used to estimate reserve levels. Moreover, while improved
actuarial techniques and expanded databases are used in estimating net loss
reserves, these tools may prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of
probable loss. Consequently, ultimate losses could materially exceed loss
reserves and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations, liquidity or financial position. Further information on the
Company’s loss reserves can be found in the “Liability for Property-Casualty
Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” discussion beginning on page 12 of this
report, as well as the Company’s Report on Loss Reserving Practices, which was
filed with the SEC on Form 8-K on June 29, 2001.


Investment Risks.

Investments in the Company’s investment portfolio have
varying degrees of risk. The most significant risk to the fixed-income
portfolio is interest rate risk, including movements in the underlying market
rates and changes in the credit spreads of the respective sectors of the fixed-income securities held. The Company has estimated the sensitivity to
hypothetical movements of market rates of 100 and 200 basis points up or down.
The analysis indicates that, as of December 31, 2001, the impact is less than
10% of the value of the fixed-income portfolio. The
common equity portfolio is managed to the Russell 1000 index, and is generally
subject to the risk of equity market volatility. Sensitivity analysis to
movements in the market show that a 10% movement in the market would result in
a 10% movement in the value of the equity portfolio.

The Company also uses simulation modeling to determine the Value-at-Risk (VaR)
of the investment portfolio. The model represents the maximum expected loss in
value of the investment portfolio in a one month period at a 95% confidence
level. A summary quantifying the investment portfolio’s sensitivities, as well as the
estimated VaR of the investment portfolio, is included in Item 7A of this
report.

Reliance on Information Technology.

The Company’s business is highly
dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information
technology and telecommunications systems. The Company relies on these systems
to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for underwriting
and rate development and to support its Internet and other direct marketing
operations, as well as to process new and renewal business, provide
customer service and make claims payments. The Company has a highly trained staff that is committed to the
continual development and maintenance of these systems. However, the failure
of these systems could interrupt the Company’s operations or materially impact
its ability to evaluate and write new business. Because the Company’s
information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend
on third party systems, the Company could experience service denials if demand
for such service exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or
experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or
service denial could result in a deterioration of the Company’s ability to
write and process new and renewal business and provide customer service or
compromise its ability to pay claims in a timely manner. This could result in
a material adverse effect on the Company’s business results.

The Company maintains insurance on its real property and other physical assets,
which includes coverage for losses due to business interruptions caused by
covered property damage. However, this insurance will not compensate the
Company for losses that may occur due to disruptions in service as a result of
a computer, data processing or telecommunications systems failure that is
unrelated to covered property damage; nor will such business interruption
insurance necessarily compensate the Company for all losses resulting from
covered events. The Company maintains redundant systems or facilities for its
principal services to help maintain functionality and reduce the risk of
significant interruptions of its operations.

In addition, a security breach of the Company’s computer systems could damage
its reputation, interrupt its operations or result in liability. The Company
retains confidential information regarding its customers and business dealings
in its computer systems. The Company spends significant capital and other
resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused
by such breaches. Any well-publicized compromise of security could deter
people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential
information to the Company’s systems. Therefore, it is critical that these
facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the
marketplace to be secure. Despite the implementation of security measures,
including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability
testing, this infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer
viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive
problems. In addition, the Company could be subject to liability if hackers
are able to penetrate its network security or otherwise misappropriate
confidential information.

Privacy Legislation.

In 1999, the U.S. Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act, which affords protection for “nonpublic personal information” relating to
consumers. The Act directed federal regulators to implement the details of the
privacy law through regulations, which were issued in final form in the first
part of 2000. Since then, virtually all state legislatures or regulatory
bodies have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, additional laws and
regulations to address privacy issues. These new laws and consumer concerns
over privacy issues have created significant uncertainty and risks to financial
institutions, which need to accurately describe their privacy practices and
develop appropriate procedures to manage and protect customer data. While the
Company has implemented a process to monitor and achieve compliance with these privacy laws, the
associated costs and potential risks and liabilities to insurers and other
financial institutions are


difficult or impossible to quantify. Moreover, the Company is unable to predict
the precise nature and content of future privacy laws and regulations, or the
effects that they may have on the business, operations, operating results or
financial condition of the Company. Potential areas of exposure facing the
industry include failure to accurately or adequately describe privacy practices
or to protect customer information from unauthorized disclosure. The lack of
uniform state laws makes ongoing compliance both expensive and difficult to manage.

Competitive Factors

The automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets in which the
Company operates are highly competitive. Property-casualty insurers generally
compete on the basis of price, consumer recognition, coverages offered, claim
handling, financial stability, customer service and geographic coverage.
Vigorous competition is provided by large, well-capitalized national companies,
some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents,
and by smaller regional insurers. While the Company relies heavily on
technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and
price according to risk potential, some competitors merely price their coverage
at rates set lower than the Company’s published rates. By avoiding extensive
data gathering and analysis, these competitors incur lower underwriting
expenses. The Company has remained competitive by closely managing expenses
and achieving operating efficiencies, and by refining its risk measurement and
price segmentation skills. In addition, the Company offers prices for a wide
spectrum of risks and seeks to offer a wider array of payment plans, limits of
liability and deductibles than its competitors. Superior customer service,
claim adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in the
Company’s competitive strategy.

Licenses

The Company operates under licenses issued by various insurance authorities.
These licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically, provided
the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements. The licenses
govern the kind of insurance coverages which may be written in the issuing
state. Such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an
appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria. All
licenses which are material to the Company’s business are in good standing.

Insurance Regulation

The insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision
by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or
licensed to transact business. At least one of the subsidiaries is licensed
and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and certain U.S.
possessions. The nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, an insurance company is subject
to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile. The
Company’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliates are domiciled in the states of
Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and
Wisconsin. State insurance departments have broad administrative power
relating to licensing insurers and agents, regulating premium rates and policy
forms, establishing reserve requirements, prescribing statutory accounting
methods and the form and content of statutory financial reports, and regulating
the type and amount of investments permitted. Rate regulation varies from
“file and use” to prior approval to mandated rates. Most jurisdictions
prohibit rates that are “excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.”

Insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that
insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a
variety of operational standards. Insurance companies are generally required
to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each
jurisdiction in which they conduct business. Insurance departments are
authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’
financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the
insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and
compliance with state insurance laws and regulations.

Insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance
authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other
transactions involving insurers and to require periodic disclosure of certain
information. These laws impose prior approval requirements for certain
transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally
regulate dividend and other distributions, including loans and cash advances,
between


regulated insurers and their affiliates. See the “Subsidiary Dividends”
discussion in Item 5(c) for further information on these dividend limitations.

Under state insolvency and guaranty laws, regulated insurers can be assessed or
required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses
resulting from insurer insolvencies. Insurers are also required by many
states, as a condition of doing business in the state, to provide coverage to
certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market. These “assigned
risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage
which must be offered to such involuntary risks, as well as the allowable
premium. Many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited
number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks. These
plans, through assessments, pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to
insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states.

Insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain
sufficient surplus to support their writings. Although the ratio of writings
to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors,
including the type of business being written, the adequacy of the insurer’s
reserves, the quality of the insurer’s assets, and the identity of the
regulator, as a general rule, the regulators prefer that annual net premiums
written be not more than three times the insurer’s total policyholders’
surplus. Thus, the amount of an insurer’s surplus may, in certain cases, limit
its ability to grow its business. The National Association of Insurance
Commissioners also has developed a risk-based capital (RBC) program to enable
regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to
insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial conditions. RBC is
a series of dynamic surplus-related formulas which contain a variety of factors
that are applied to financial balances based on a degree of certain risks, such
as asset, credit and underwriting risks.

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a
market. For example, certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to
cancel and non-renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer
from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant
to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state
insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption.
Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject
program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s
ability to exit unprofitable markets.

Regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and
developments arise. Some changes may be due to technical factors, such as
changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment vehicles; other
changes result from such general pressures as consumer resistance to price
increases and concerns relating to insurer solvency. In recent years,
legislation and voter initiatives have been introduced, and in some cases
adopted, which deal with use of non-public consumer information, use of credit
in underwriting, insurance rate development, rate determination and the ability
of insurers to cancel or non-renew insurance policies, reflecting concerns about
consumer privacy, coverage, availability, prices and alleged discriminatory
pricing. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and
certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance
industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary.

In 1999, Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLB”), which
among other things places new requirements on financial institutions, including
insurance companies, designed to protect the “nonpublic personal information”
of consumers. GLB requires each financial institution to provide to its
customers a copy of the institution’s privacy policy at the commencement and at
least annually during the term of the customer relationship. Subject to
certain exceptions, GLB prohibits a financial institution from disclosing to
nonaffiliated third parties any nonpublic personal information pertaining to
its consumers, unless the financial institution first provides to its consumers
a copy of its privacy policy and gives the consumers an opportunity to “opt
out” of such disclosures. Various states have enacted or are expected to enact
privacy legislation or regulations which may impose additional requirements.
State privacy laws are continuing to evolve, and the Company has implemented a
process to monitor and achieve compliance with such laws as they are
promulgated.

In some states, the automobile insurance industry has been under pressure in
past years from regulators, legislators or special interest groups to reduce,
freeze or set rates to or at levels that are not necessarily related to
underlying costs, including initiatives to roll back automobile and other
personal lines rates. This kind of activity has adversely affected, and may in
the future adversely affect, the profitability and growth of the subsidiaries’
automobile insurance business in those jurisdictions, and may limit the
subsidiaries’ ability to increase rates to compensate for increases in costs.


Adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the subsidiaries’ ability
to price automobile insurance adequately, or affecting the subsidiaries’
insurance operations adversely in other ways, may occur in the future. The
impact of these regulatory changes on the subsidiaries’ businesses cannot be
predicted.

The Company files statutory-based financial statements with state insurance
departments in all states in which the Company is licensed. On January 1,
2001, significant changes to the statutory basis of accounting became
effective. The cumulative effect of these changes was recorded as a direct
adjustment to statutory surplus. The effect of adoption increased statutory
surplus by $340.5 million. The Company expects that statutory surplus will
continue to be in excess of the regulatory risk-based capital requirements.

Statutory Accounting Principles

The Company’s results are reported in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP), which differ from amounts reported under
statutory accounting principles (SAP) prescribed by insurance regulatory
authorities. Specifically, under GAAP:

1.

Commissions, premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in
connection with writing new and renewal business are capitalized and
amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related
premiums are earned, rather than expensed as incurred, as required by SAP.

2.

Certain assets are included in the consolidated balance sheets, but are
charged directly against statutory surplus under SAP. These assets
consist primarily of premium receivables that are outstanding over 90
days, federal deferred tax assets in excess of statutory limitations,
furniture, equipment, leasehold improvements and prepaid expenses.

3.

Amounts related to ceded reinsurance are shown gross as prepaid
reinsurance premiums and reinsurance recoverables, rather than netted
against unearned premium reserves and loss and loss adjustment expense
reserves, respectively, as required by SAP.

4.

Fixed maturities securities, which are classified as available-for-sale,
are reported at current market values, rather than at amortized cost, or
the lower of amortized cost or market, depending on the specific type of
security, as required by SAP. Equity securities are reported at quoted
market values which may differ from the NAIC market values as required by
SAP.

5.

Costs for application computer software developed or obtained for
internal use are capitalized and amortized over their useful life, rather
then expensed as incurred, as required by SAP.

6.

The differing treatment of income and expense items results in a
corresponding difference in federal income tax expense.


Investments

The Company employs a conservative approach to investment and capital
management intended to ensure that there is sufficient capital to support all
the insurance premium that can be profitably written. The Company’s portfolio
is invested primarily in short-term and intermediate-term, investment-grade
fixed-income securities. The Company’s investment portfolio, at market value,
was $8,226.3 million at December 31, 2001, compared to $6,983.3 million at
December 31, 2000. Investment income is affected by shifts in the types of
investments in the portfolio, changes in interest rates and other factors.
Investment income, including net realized gains/losses on security sales,
before expenses and taxes, was $301.7 million in 2001, compared to $402.1
million in 2000 and $387.9 million in 1999. See Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on pages 46 through
51 of the Company’s Annual Report.

Employees

The number of employees, excluding temporary employees, at December 31, 2001,
was 20,442.


Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

The consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) of the Company’s insurance
subsidiaries. The Company’s objective is to establish case and incurred but
not reported reserves that are adequate to cover all loss costs, while
sustaining minimal variation from the date that the reserves are initially
established until losses are fully developed. The liabilities for losses and
LAE are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent
undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and LAE
incurred through December 31 of each year. These estimates are subject to the
effect of future trends on claim settlement. These estimates are continually
reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.
Such adjustments, if any, are reflected in the current results of operations.

The accompanying tables present an analysis of property-casualty losses and
LAE. The following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending
estimated liability balances for 2001, 2000 and 1999 on a GAAP basis.

During 2001, the Company experienced $99.0 million of favorable loss reserve
development, compared to $75.8 million of adverse development in 2000 and $29.8
million of favorable development in 1999. The favorable development in 2001 is
primarily attributable to the settlement of claims at less than amounts
reserved, while the prior year’s adverse development reflected the Company’s
effort to fully recognize the loss trends that were emerging. The development
in 2001 primarily relates to the 2000 accident year, while the majority of the
2000 adverse development related to the 1999 accident year. The Company
conducts extensive reviews each month on portions of its business to help
ensure that the Company is meeting its objective of always having reserves that
are adequate, with minimal variation.

The anticipated effect of inflation is explicitly considered when estimating
liabilities for losses and LAE. While anticipated increases due to inflation
are considered in estimating the ultimate claim costs, the increase in average
severities of claims is caused by a number of factors that vary with the
individual type of policy written. Future average severities are projected
based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting
standards, inflation, policy provisions and general economic trends. These
anticipated trends are monitored based on actual development and are modified
if necessary.

The Company has not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar
transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves.

1      Represents loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid
losses at the balance sheet date.

2      Cumulative development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and LAE.

3      In 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 113,
“Accounting and Reporting of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts,” and,
per the provisions of the Statement, began presenting its liability for unpaid
losses and LAE on a gross basis.

4      In 1994, based on a review of its total loss reserves, the Company eliminated
its $71.0 million “supplemental reserve.”


The above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for 1991
through 2000. The top line of the table shows the estimated liability for
unpaid losses and LAE recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the
indicated years for the property-casualty insurance subsidiaries only. This
liability represents the estimated amount of losses and LAE for claims that are
unpaid at the balance sheet date, including losses that had been incurred but
not reported.

The table also presents the re-estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE on
a gross basis, with separate disclosure of the re-estimated reinsurance
recoverables on unpaid losses. The presentation appears for all periods in
which the income
recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 113,
“Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration
Contracts,” have been applied.

The upper section of the table shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to
the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year. The
lower portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously
recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year.
The estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims
becomes known for individual years. For example, as of December 31, 2001 the
companies had paid $685.1 million of the currently estimated $713.3 million of
losses and LAE that had been incurred through the end of 1992; thus an
estimated $28.2 million of losses incurred through 1992 remain unpaid as of the
current financial statement date.

The cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the estimates
over all prior years. For example, the 1991 liability has developed
conservatively by $170.4 million over ten years. That amount has been
reflected in income over the ten years and did not have a significant effect on
the income of any one year. The effects on income during the past three years
due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and LAE is shown in
the reconciliation table on page 12 as the “prior years” contribution to
incurred losses and LAE.

In evaluating this information, note that each cumulative development amount
includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for
prior periods. For example, the amount of the development related to losses
settled in 1994, but incurred in 1991, will be included in the cumulative
development amount for years 1991, 1992 and 1993. Conditions and trends that
have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily
occur in the future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to
extrapolate future development based on this table.

During 1994, based on a review of the adequacy of its total loss reserves, the
Company eliminated its $71.0 million “supplemental reserve.” Prior to 1994,
the Company established case and IBNR reserves by product with the objective of
being accurate to within plus or minus two percent. Pricing had been based on
these estimates of reserves by product. Because the Company desired a very
high degree of comfort that aggregate reserves were adequate, aggregate
reserves were established near the upper end of the reasonable range of
reserves, and the difference between such aggregate reserves and the midpoint
of the reasonable range of case and IBNR reserves was called the “supplemental
reserve.” The Company concluded, after examining its historical aggregate
reserves, that the practice of setting aggregate reserves at the upper end of
the range of reasonable reserves provided an unnecessarily high level of
comfort. Even without the high level of comfort provided by the “supplemental
reserve,” the Company’s reserves had historically been redundant. The Company
believes that this change in the estimate of its reserves placed the Company
more in line with the practices of other companies in the industry.

The Analysis of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Development table on page 13
is constructed from Schedule P, Part-1, from the Consolidated
Annual Statements, as filed with the state insurance departments. This development table differs from the
development displayed in Schedule P, Part-2 due to the fact Schedule P, Part-2
excludes unallocated loss adjustment expenses and reflects the change in the
method of accounting for salvage and subrogation for 1994 and prior.

(d)  Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations

The Company operates throughout the United States. The Company ceased writing
new business in Canada in 1999.


ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

The Company’s corporate headquarters office complex is located on a 42-acre
parcel in Mayfield Village, Ohio. The Company also owns a 72-acre corporate
office complex near the headquarters. In total, these two sites contain
approximately 1.36 million square feet and are owned by a subsidiary. The
second complex was constructed at a total cost of $129.0 million, with the
final building completed in the first quarter of 2001. The construction project
was funded through operating cash flows.

The Company also owns seven other buildings in suburbs adjoining the corporate
office complexes, six buildings in Tampa, Florida, and a building in each of
the following cities: Tempe, Arizona; Ft. Lauderdale, Florida; Albany, New
York; Tigard, Oregon; Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania; and Austin, Texas. Six
of these buildings are partially leased to non-affiliates. In total, these
buildings contain approximately 1.63 million square feet of office, warehouse
and training facility space and are owned by subsidiaries of the Company.
These facilities are occupied by the Company’s business units or other
operations and are not segregated by industry segment.

The Company leases approximately 680,000 square feet of office and warehouse
space at various locations throughout the United States for its other business
units and staff functions. In addition, the Company leases 356 claim offices,
consisting of approximately 1.86 million square feet, at various locations
throughout the United States. These leases are generally short-term to
medium-term leases of standard commercial office space.

As the Company continues to grow, it expects that it will need additional space
and is actively engaged in seeking out additional locations to meet its current
and anticipated needs.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Like many other members of the insurance industry, the Company is the target of
an increasing number of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation.
There are currently four putative class action lawsuits pending against the
Company in various state courts seeking actual and punitive damages and
alleging breach of contract and fraud because of the Company’s specification of
after-market (non-original equipment manufacturer) replacement parts in the
repair of insured or claimant vehicles. Similar lawsuits have been filed
against several other insurance carriers. Plaintiffs in these suits allege
that after-market parts are inferior to replacement parts manufactured by the
vehicle’s original manufacturer and that the use of such parts fails to restore
the damaged vehicle to its “pre-loss” condition, as required by their insurance
policies. The Company is vigorously defending these lawsuits, which are in
various stages of development. The outcome of these lawsuits is currently
uncertain.

The Company is defending six putative class action lawsuits in various state
courts seeking damages from the Company alleging breach of contract for failing
to pay inherent diminished value to insureds under the collision, comprehensive
or uninsured motorist property damage provisions of their auto policies.
Similar lawsuits have been filed against several other insurance carriers.
Inherent diminished value is defined by plaintiffs as the difference between
the market value of the insured automobile before an accident and the market
value after proper repair. Plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to the
payment of inherent diminished value under the terms of their insurance
policies. The Company is vigorously defending these lawsuits, which are in
various stages of development. In February, 2002, the Company reached an
agreement to settle its Georgia diminution in value case for between $19.4
million and $20.0 million. The outcome of the remaining lawsuits is currently
uncertain. The Company believes that Georgia law on diminution in value is an
anomaly and has successfully defended several of these cases in other
jurisdictions.

There are two putative class action lawsuits pending against the Company in
Florida challenging the legal propriety of the Company’s payment of preferred
provider rates on personal injury protection (“PIP”) claims. The primary issue
is whether the Company violated Florida law by paying PIP medical expense
claims at preferred provider rates. The Company is vigorously defending these
lawsuits, which are in various stages of development. The outcome of these
disputes is currently uncertain.

There are currently three putative class actions pending against the Company
which challenge the Company’s use of certain automated database vendors to
assist in valuing total loss claims. Similar lawsuits have been filed against
other carriers in the industry. Plaintiffs allege that these databases
systematically undervalue total loss claims to the


detriment of insureds. The
plaintiffs are seeking actual and punitive damages. The lawsuits are in
various stages of development. The Company is vigorously defending these
lawsuits. The outcome of these cases is currently uncertain.

The Company is currently defending four lawsuits involving worker
classification issues. These lawsuits relate to the classification of the
Company’s California claims employees as exempt workers for purposes of state
wage and hour laws and/or challenge the Company’s exempt employee
classification under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. The Company is
vigorously defending these lawsuits, which are in various stages of
development. The outcome of these cases is uncertain at this time.

The Company is currently defending three putative class actions which challenge
the subsidiaries’ alternative commissions programs. In one of these cases,
which is pending in Texas, the plaintiffs allege that the different rates
charged are unfairly discriminatory in violation of applicable state law. The
other two cases allege that the Company does not adequately disclose the
availability of the alternative programs and induces its agents to place
applicants in the highest priced programs. These lawsuits are in various
stages of development. The Company is vigorously defending these lawsuits.
Their outcome is uncertain at this time.

The Company is currently defending four cases, three of which are putative
class actions, which challenge certain aspects of the Company’s use of credit
information in underwriting. All of these cases are in their early stages and
no discovery has been completed in three of the cases. As a consequence, the
Company is not yet in a position to assess its exposure, if any. The Company
plans to vigorously defend each of these cases.

Various other legal and regulatory actions are currently pending that challenge
certain aspects of the Company’s business operations.

The Company has established reserves for those lawsuits for which it is able to
estimate its potential exposure. No reserves have been established for those
cases for which the Company is unable to estimate its potential exposure. At
this time, based on information currently known by the Company and the status
of these lawsuits, management believes that the Company’s ultimate liability,
if any, in those actions for which reserves have been established in excess of
amounts currently reserved will not have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations, liquidity or financial position of the Company.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

Incorporated by reference from information with respect to executive officers
of The Progressive Corporation and its subsidiaries set forth in Item 10 in
Part III of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

(a)  Market Information and Dividends

The Company’s Common Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol PGR. The high and low prices set forth below are as reported on the
consolidated transaction reporting system.

The closing price of the Company’s Common Shares on February 28, 2002 was
$155.80.

On March 19, 2002, the Board of Directors of The Progressive Corporation
approved a 3 for 1 split of the Company’s Common Shares, $1.00 par value, to be
effected in the form of a stock dividend. In connection with the transaction,
two additional Common Shares will be issued on April 22, 2002, for each Common
Share held by shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 1,
2002. The purpose of the stock split is to increase the supply of the
Company’s Common Shares and to improve the liquidity of the stock. All of the
information presented above is on a pre-split basis.

(b)  Holders

There were 3,586 shareholders of record on February 28, 2002.

(c)  Subsidiary Dividends

Statutory policyholders’ surplus was $2,647.7 million and $2,177.0 million at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 2001, $333.8 million
of consolidated statutory policyholders’ surplus represents net admitted assets
of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliates that are required to
meet minimum statutory surplus requirements in such entities’ states of
domicile. The companies may be licensed in states other than their states of
domicile, which may have higher minimum statutory surplus requirements.
Generally, the net admitted assets of insurance companies that, subject to
other applicable insurance laws and regulations, are available for transfer to
the parent company cannot include the net admitted assets required to meet the
