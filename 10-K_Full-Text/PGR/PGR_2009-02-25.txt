PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

(a) General Development of Business

The Progressive insurance organization began business in 1937. The Progressive Corporation, an insurance holding company formed in 1965, currently has 58 subsidiaries and
1 mutual insurance company affiliate. Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate provide personal and commercial automobile insurance and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services throughout the United States. Our
property-casualty insurance products protect our customers against losses due to collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles and uninsured and underinsured bodily injury, and liability to others for personal injury or property damage
arising out of the use of those vehicles. Our non-insurance subsidiaries generally support our insurance and investment operations.

(b) Financial
Information About Segments

Incorporated by reference from

Note 10 - Segment Information

in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to
this Form 10-K.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

We offer a number of personal and commercial property-casualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles. Net premiums written were $13.6 billion in 2008, compared to $13.8 billion in 2007 and $14.1 billion in 2006. Our
combined ratio, calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), was 94.6 in 2008, 92.6 in 2007, and 86.7 in 2006.

Organization

We write private passenger auto insurance and the majority of our special lines products in all
50 states; we began writing auto and boat insurance in Massachusetts during 2008. We also write private passenger auto in the District of Columbia. We write commercial auto policies in 49 states; we do not currently write commercial auto in Hawaii
or the District of Columbia.

Auto insurance differs greatly by community because regulations and legal decisions vary by state and because, among other
factors, traffic, law enforcement, cultural attitudes, insurance agents, medical services, and auto repair services vary by community. To respond to these local differences, we are organized as follows:

•

Our Personal Lines product management group is organized by state into four geographic regions, led by a general manager for each region for our private passenger
auto products. The special lines product management group is organized by product and led by a general manager.

•

Our Commercial Auto business is organized by state with product managers responsible for local implementation. These state-level managers are led by a general
manager.

•

Our Claims business area, which supports both the Personal Lines and Commercial Auto businesses, is organized into six geographic regions, with a general manager
responsible for each region.

•

Our business area general managers each report to one of our Group Presidents (discussed below).

Our Direct sales and customer service groups, located at call centers in Mayfield Village, Ohio; Austin, Texas; Tampa, Florida; Sacramento, California; Tempe, Arizona;
and Colorado Springs, Colorado, support our underwriting and claims operations.

Our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic
decisions and includes the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Chief Human Resource Officer, as well as our three Group Presidents
(Personal Lines, Commercial Lines, and Claims). The Group Presidents are responsible for the development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing
preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance products.


Personal Lines

Our Personal Lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreational and other vehicles. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each program targeted to a specific distribution
channel, market, or customer group. The Personal Lines business accounted for approximately 87% of total net premiums written for each of the last three years. Our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full line of auto insurance
products with superior service, distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers.

We ranked fourth in industry market share for 2007 based on
net premiums written and believe that we held that position for 2008. There are approximately 360 competitors in the total private passenger auto market. Progressive and the other leading 15 private passenger auto insurers, each of whom write over
$2 billion of premiums, comprise about 75% of this market. For 2008, the estimated industry net premiums written for personal auto insurance in the United States was $159.9 billion, and our share of this market was approximately 7.2%, compared to
$159.1 billion and 7.3%, respectively, in 2007, and $160.2 billion and 7.4% in 2006. Except as otherwise noted, all industry data and our market share or ranking in the industry either were derived directly from data reported by A.M. Best Company,
Inc. (“A.M. Best”) or were estimated using A.M. Best data as the primary source.

Private passenger automobile insurance represented
approximately 90% of our total Personal Lines net premiums written for the last three years. Volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness, brand recognition, service quality, and the actions of our competitors, among other factors. See
“Competitive Factors” on page 4 of this report for further discussion.

Our specialty Personal Lines products include insurance for motorcycles,
recreational vehicles, mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles, and similar items. Due to the nature of these products, we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months. Our competitors are specialty companies and large
multi-line insurance carriers. Although industry figures are not available, based on our analysis of this market, we believe that we are one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market, and that we have been the market share
leader for the motorcycle product since 1998.

The Personal Lines business is generated either by independent agents and brokers or written directly online
or by phone. The Agency business includes business written by our network of more than 30,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United States, as well as brokerages in New York and California. These independent insurance agents
and brokers have the ability to place business with Progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines, subject to compliance with company-mandated procedures. Our guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of
coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk. The agents and brokers do not have authority on behalf of Progressive to establish underwriting guidelines, develop rates, settle or adjust
claims, or enter into other transactions or commitments. The Agency business also writes through strategic alliance business relationships with other insurance companies, financial institutions, and national agencies. In 2008, the total net premiums
written through the Agency business represented 62% of our Personal Lines volume, compared to 63% in 2007 and 64% in 2006.

The Direct business includes
business written directly by us online and over the phone. Net premiums written in the Direct business were 38%, 37%, and 36% of our Personal Lines volume in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

We also currently offer a personal umbrella insurance product in 24 states through certain independent agents and to Direct business customers via telephone. We began
offering this product in select markets in 2006 and have been expanding into additional markets as we have evaluated and met certain performance criteria. We plan to continue the roll-out in both channels during 2009.

Progressive Home Advantage, our offering which combines a Progressive auto policy with a homeowner’s or renter’s policy underwritten by Homesite Insurance,
expanded in 2008. We provide this option to customers in 46 states for Direct buyers and in 33 states for Agency customers. In 2009, we plan to make this offering available through additional agents.

Commercial Auto

The Commercial Auto business writes primary
liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented approximately 13% of our total net premiums written for each of the last three years. The majority of our Commercial Auto customers insure
three or fewer vehicles. The Commercial Auto business, which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel, operates in the specialty truck and business auto markets. The specialty truck commercial auto market, which accounts for
slightly more than half of our total Commercial Auto premiums and approximately 40% of the vehicles we insure in this business, includes dump trucks, logging trucks, tow trucks, local cartage, and other short-haul commercial vehicles. The remainder
is in the business auto market, which includes autos, vans, and pick-up trucks used by artisans, such as contractors, landscapers, and plumbers, and a variety of other small businesses. In 2007, we introduced cargo and general liability insurance in
select markets, with further state expansion in 2008. Although


the Commercial Auto business differs from Personal Lines auto in its customer bases and products written, both businesses require the same fundamental
skills, including disciplined underwriting and pricing, as well as excellent claims service. There are approximately 360 competitors in the total commercial auto market. We primarily compete with 33 other large companies/groups, each with over $190
million of commercial auto premiums written annually. These leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75% of this market. Our Commercial Auto business ranked third in the commercial auto insurance market for 2007, and we believe that we could
rank third, or possibly fourth, for 2008.

Other Indemnity Businesses

Our other indemnity businesses, which represented less than 1% of our net premiums written in each of the last three years, primarily include writing professional liability insurance for community banks, principally
directors and officers liability insurance. We reinsure the majority of the risk on these coverages with a small mutual reinsurer controlled by its bank customers and various other reinsurance entities. The program, sponsored by the American Bankers
Association, insures over 1,700 banks, representing every state. In addition, our other indemnity businesses include managing our run-off businesses.

Service Businesses

Our service businesses provide insurance-related services and represented less than 1% of our revenues in each of
the last three years. Our principal service business is providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services for the Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans (CAIP), which are state-supervised plans serving the involuntary market. The decrease
in service business revenues reflects the continuing cyclical downturn in the involuntary commercial auto market. We have previously competed with two other carriers for the majority of the CAIP market. However, one of these other carriers ceased
writing new business in the second quarter 2008, and the remaining carrier recently announced that it will cease writing new business in early 2009. This will leave us as the largest CAIP provider countrywide. Although we expect that our market
share will be increasing, we may not realize an immediate effect to revenues as the cyclical downturn in the CAIP market continues. In addition, we do not expect any increase in revenues to be material to our financial results. As a service
provider, we collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related policies. We cede 100% of the premiums and losses to the state plans. Reimbursements to us from the CAIP plans are required by state laws and
regulations. Material violations of contractual service standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business. We have maintained, and plan to continue to maintain, compliance with these standards. Any changes in our participation as
a CAIP service provider would not materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Claims

We manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 460 claims offices located throughout the United States. In addition, we have in operation 54
centers, in 41 metropolitan areas across the country, that provide our concierge level claims service. These facilities are designed to provide end-to-end resolution for auto physical damage losses. Customers can choose to bring their vehicles to
one of these sites, where they can pick up a rental vehicle. Our representatives will then write the estimate, select a qualified repair shop, arrange the repair, including pick up and delivery of the vehicle, and inspect the vehicle once the
repairs are complete. We received a U.S. patent in 2008 for this innovative approach to the vehicle repair process, which increases consumer satisfaction, increases our productivity, and improves the cycle time and quality of repairs. Concierge
level of claims service is our primary approach to damage assessment and coordination of vehicle repairs at authorized auto repair facilities in these markets.

Competitive Factors

The automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive.
Property-casualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price, consumer recognition, coverages offered and other product features, claims handling, financial stability, customer service, and geographic coverage. Vigorous competition is provided
by large, well-capitalized national companies, some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents, and by smaller regional insurers. Over the last few years, comparative rating services have gained prominence, adding
transparency to industry pricing, and many of our competitors have significantly increased their advertising and marketing efforts and/or expanded their online service offerings. These changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the
automobile and other property-casualty insurance markets.

We rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and
price accurately according to risk potential. We have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills, closely managing expenses, and achieving operating efficiencies. Superior customer service, fair and accurate
claims adjusting, and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy.


State Insurance Licenses

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. These licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically, provided the holder continues to
meet applicable regulatory requirements. Our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state. Such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate
application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria. All licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing.

Insurance Regulation

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance
departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business. At least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The nature and
extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile. Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and
its affiliate are domiciled in the states of Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin. State insurance departments have broad administrative powers relating to licensing insurers and agents, regulating
premium changes and policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, regulating compliance with statutory accounting methods, and the content of statutory financial reports, and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted. Rate
regulation varies from “use and file,” to “file and use,” to prior approval.

Insurance departments are charged with the responsibility
of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards. Insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each
jurisdiction in which they conduct business. Insurance departments are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure
adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations.

Insurance holding company laws enacted in many
jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information. These laws impose prior approval requirements for certain
transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions, including loans and cash advances, between regulated insurers and their affiliates. See the “Dividends” discussion in
Item 5(c) herein for further information on these dividend limitations.

Under state insolvency and guaranty laws, regulated insurers can be assessed
or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers. Insurers are also required by many states, as a condition of doing business in the state, to provide coverage to certain
risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market. These “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks, as well as the allowable premium. Many
states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks. These plans, through assessments, pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write
voluntary coverages in those states.

Insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their
writings. Although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors (including applicable law, the type of business being written, the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves, and the quality of
the insurer’s assets), the annual net premiums that an insurer may write have historically been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus, generally 3 to 1. Thus, the amount of an
insurer’s surplus, in certain cases, may limit its ability to grow its business. At year-end 2008, the combined premiums to surplus ratio for all Progressive insurance companies was 3.0 to 1; in addition, we have access to $1.0 billion in a
non-insurance subsidiary, portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth as needed. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) also has developed a risk-based capital (RBC)
program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition. RBC is a series of dynamic surplus-related formulas that contain a variety of factors
that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks, such as asset, credit, and underwriting risks. Progressive’s RBC ratios are well in excess of minimum requirements.

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market. For example, certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to
cancel or non-renew policies. Certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance department may
disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or non-renewal of policies, or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements, may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit
unprofitable markets or businesses.


Regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise. Some changes may be due to
economic developments, such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products; other changes result from such general pressures as consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting
practices and solvency. In recent years, legislation, regulatory measures, and voter initiatives have been introduced, and in some cases adopted, which deal with use of non-public consumer information, use of financial responsibility, and credit
information in underwriting, insurance rate development, rate of return limitations, rate determination, and the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew insurance policies, reflecting concerns about consumer privacy, coverage, availability,
prices, and alleged discriminatory pricing. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary.

In a number of states, Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information (credit) as part of the underwriting
or rating process. This practice is expressly authorized by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, and our information demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk. The use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject
of significant regulatory and legislative activity. Regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit, including: questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports, perceptions that credit may have a
disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups, the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk, the treatment of persons with limited or no credit, the impact on credit of extraordinary life
events (e.g., catastrophic injury or death of a spouse), and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers. A number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins, directives, or regulations to regulate the use
of credit by insurers. In addition, a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit. Also, at the direction of Congress, the Federal Trade Commission studied the effects of the use of credit
information on the availability and affordability of insurance and the extent to which credit information impacted the availability and affordability of insurance by geography, income, ethnicity, and race. As a result of this study, it is possible
that Congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting the use of credit in underwriting and rating.


Statutory Accounting Principles

Our results are reported in accordance with GAAP, which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles (SAP) prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities. Certain significant
differences are described below:

Investments

Our approach to investment and capital management seeks to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write. Our portfolio is invested primarily in short-term and
intermediate-term, investment-grade fixed-income securities. Our investment portfolio had a fair value of $13.0 billion at December 31, 2008, compared to $14.2 billion at December 31, 2007. Investment income (loss) is affected by the
variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio, shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio, changes in yield, and other factors. Investment income (loss), including net realized gains (losses) on securities, before expenses
and taxes, was $(807.4) million in 2008, compared to $787.1 million in 2007 and $638.1 million in 2006. For more detailed discussion, see

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

in our Annual
Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.


Employees

The
number of employees, excluding temporary employees, at December 31, 2008, was 25,929, all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of The Progressive Corporation.

Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

The consolidated financial statements
include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries. Our objective is to ensure that total reserves (i.e., case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves, or
“IBNR”) are adequate to cover all loss costs, while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed. The liabilities for losses and LAE are determined using actuarial and
statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and LAE incurred through December 31 of each year. These estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement, among
other factors. These estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current results of operations
and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates. A detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “Report on Loss Reserving Practices,” which was filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) on Form 8-K on June 30, 2008, as well as in section “V. Critical Accounting Policies” of our

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

in our Annual Report,
which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K. The accompanying tables present information concerning our property-casualty losses and LAE.

The
following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years:

RECONCILIATION OF NET RESERVES
FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

Our objective is to establish case and IBNR reserves that are adequate to cover all loss costs, while sustaining
minimal variation from the date that the reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed. Our reserves developed unfavorably in both 2008 and 2007, compared to favorable development in 2006. Total development consists of net
changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves, based on regularly scheduled reviews, claims settling for more or less than reserved, emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than reserved, and changes in reserve
estimates by claim representatives. In 2008, an increase in the number of late reported Commercial Auto claims, and an increase in the estimated severity on these claims, was a primary contributor to the unfavorable development. The unfavorable
development in 2007 was due to the settlement of some large outstanding litigation, the number of large losses emerging from prior accident years being more than anticipated, plus the result of reviews of large bodily injury and uninsured motorist
claims. The favorable development in 2006 reflected the recognition of lower severity for prior accident years than had been previously estimated.

In
establishing loss reserves, we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policies written. These severities are projected based on historical
trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards, inflation, policy provisions, claims resolution practices, and general economic trends. These anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are
modified if necessary.

We have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves.


ANALYSIS OF LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES DEVELOPMENT

(millions)


Represents loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses at the balance sheet date.


Cumulative development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and LAE - Net.

The above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and LAE from 1998 through 2007. The top line of the table shows the estimated liability
for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the property-casualty insurance subsidiaries only. This liability represents the estimated amount of losses and LAE for claims that were unpaid at the
balance sheet date, including IBNR. The table also presents the re-estimated


liability for unpaid losses and LAE on a gross basis, with separate disclosure of the re-estimated reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses.

The upper section of the table (labeled “Paid (Cumulative) as of:”) shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of
the end of each succeeding year. The lower portion of the table (labeled “Liability Re-estimated as of:”) shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The
re-estimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the reserve date. The estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years. For
example, as of December 31, 2008, our insurance subsidiaries had paid $2.26 billion of the currently estimated $2.29 billion of losses and LAE that had been unpaid at the end of 1999; thus, an estimated $29.6 million of losses incurred through
1999 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date.

The net cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss
estimate over all prior years. For example, the 1998 liability has developed favorably by $18.6 million over ten years. That amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on the income in calendar year 1999. The
effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and LAE are shown in the reconciliation table on page 8 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and LAE.

In evaluating this information, note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods.
For example, the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2008, but incurred in 2005, will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2005, 2006, and 2007. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the
liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table.

From 1998 through 2001, while we experienced an increase in bodily injury severity, our developed reserves were within $100 million each year, or 4%, of our original estimates. The bodily injury severity change was much lower than we
expected between 2002 and 2005; thus, the reserve run-off for these years was very favorable following the end of each year, or about 4% to 10% of our original carried amounts. During 2007 and 2008, the 2006 and 2007 year-end reserves experienced
unfavorable development as higher than anticipated severity estimates were realized. In 2008, the estimated severity for the two most recent prior accident years (2007 and 2006) both increased less than 1.0% for personal auto and increased 3.9% and
1.0%, respectively, for Commercial Auto. For older accident years, the changes in estimated severity were generally downward.

Although the detail is not
presented in the table on page 9, we also re-estimate the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses each year. The top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year, while the
bottom shows the reserves re-estimated based on development in subsequent years. For example, at December 31, 2007, we estimated our reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses to be $287.5 million. During 2008, these reserves developed
unfavorably by $33.8 million, bringing the re-estimated reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses to $321.3 million, as shown at the bottom of the table.

The Analysis of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Development table on page 9 is constructed from Schedule P, Part-1, from the Consolidated Annual Statements of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries, as filed with the state insurance
departments.

Progressive’s business involves various risks
and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. Management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may affect our ability to achieve our business objectives:

•

Operating Risks

are those stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations.

•

Investing Risks

are uncertainties relating to the performance and preservation of our investment portfolios.

•

Financing Risks

generally relate to our ability to obtain capital, when necessary, to pay or otherwise perform our obligations, including obligations under
any debt instruments issued, and to earn the cost of equity capital.

Although we have organized risks generally according to these
categories in the discussion below, it should be noted that many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. For example, although presented as an Operating Risk below, state regulation of insurance companies may also affect our
investing and financing activities. Similarly, while setting insurance rates, establishing loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as Operating Risks, errors in these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing
areas as well. The categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed.

This information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the
SEC, as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time.

It should be noted that our business and that of other
insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. Issues such as unemployment rates, sales of new vehicles, inflation or deflation, stock market valuations, interest rates, consumer
confidence and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses. In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, we could experience a materially adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. In that case, the market price of our common shares could decline materially.

I.

Operating Risks

We compete in the automobile insurance and
other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive.

We face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national companies and
smaller regional insurers. Other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. Many of these companies have substantial resources, experienced management and sophisticated
marketing, underwriting and pricing strategies. Our business focuses on insurance for personal automobiles and recreation vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses. Competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies
and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer. We could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business, or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers, as a result of competitors offering
similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives. The automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, operational effectiveness
(including, for example, rate and claim-paying accuracy, customer experience, and application of information technology), pricing, and cost control are major competitive factors.

Historically, the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry, which has been defined by periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers.
This price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market,” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. Unexpected increases in the insurers’ underlying costs (such as vehicle repair costs, medical costs and
the expenses to resolve claims) can further decrease profits or result in underwriting losses. As the insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies), the historical reaction has been for insurers to
raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a “hard market”) in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels. As more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower
their rates, starting the cycle over again. In the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. We cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market, nor can we predict whether it will do
so in the future.

From time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. Based
on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors’, then-current or historical modes of doing business, and these changes must be instituted in the context of a
complicated regulatory environment. As such, our innovations may entail a degree of complexity and risk that


makes their implementation a challenge, and our efforts may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals. In addition, these initiatives may disrupt our
relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). Our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical,
however, to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position; if we fail to do so, our business could be materially adversely affected.

At the same time,
innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. This can include product, pricing or marketing innovations, new or improved services, technology advances, or new modes of doing business
that enhance the customer’s ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies, among other initiatives. Our ability to react to such advances and then navigate the new competitive environment is also important to our success.

We undertake distinctive advertising campaigns, and other efforts to improve brand recognition, generate new business and increase the retention of our
current customers. If these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, our business could be materially adversely affected. We believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns relative
to those of our competitors is particularly important given the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts within the automobile insurance market.

The highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors. In the event of a failure of a major insurer, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other
insurance companies may be required under state-mandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders.

Our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success.

Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. Our loss of
certain key officers and employees, or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers with a variety of backgrounds and experiences, could have a materially adverse effect on our business.

In addition, we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable
accuracy and adjust our hiring programs and employment levels accordingly. Our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would
adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. In either such event, our financial results and customer relationships could be
materially adversely affected.

We further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing models and
employee culture that we have developed over the years. Our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment
marketplace. In such events, the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins.

The Progressive Corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations.

Progressive’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state
insurance departments in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. In addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. Our
insurance subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success.

Certain states impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance
subsidiaries’ ability to operate, innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. Our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, such as, in recent years,
legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze, set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of
return that an insurance company may earn. Insurance laws and regulations may limit our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased
or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances or prescribe the form and content of certain
disclosures and notices to policyholders. In addition, laws in certain states mandate that insurance companies pay assessments arising in a number of circumstances, including to pay claims upon the insolvency of


other insurance companies or to cover losses in state-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. Compliance with
insurance-related laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. These costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the
applicable jurisdictions.

In addition, the innovative strategies that we pursue in our efforts to compete may deviate from standard practices in the
industry. These innovations often involve significant complexity and, as a result, can be a challenge to implement, requiring us to effectively deploy our management and other resources. This may create the potential for errors or inaccuracies in
our implementation of the strategy. If we are alleged to have damaged or otherwise disadvantaged consumers, competitors or other industry participants as a result, we could be subject to regulatory or other official investigations and sanctions, as
well as litigation from third parties.

The failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations, or the alleged failure to so comply, by us
or other companies in the insurance, financial services or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general or other law enforcement officials. Such actions and investigations, and any
determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary’s
authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, The Progressive Corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or
regulations.

New legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business
profitably in one or more states. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. We are unable
to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses.

State insurance
regulation may create risks and uncertainties for Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. For further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the “Insurance Regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of
this report.

Lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the
future.

The Progressive Corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in putative class action and other lawsuits challenging
various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations. Other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. These lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ total
loss evaluation methodology; use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection and medical payment claims;
other claims handling procedures; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; and policy implementation and renewal procedures, among other matters. From time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging
that our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employment-related practices, allegations of
medical and attorney malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations. In addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and
although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries’ business operations.

Lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. Moreover, as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields, a new
layer of court-imposed regulation could emerge, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business.

Litigation is inherently unpredictable.
Except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business, operations,
profitability or financial condition. For further information on pending litigation, see

Note 12—Litigation

in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

Our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders.

Our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. The role of the
pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses and to earn a profit.


Pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident
trends, loss costs and expenses, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. As a result, our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:

•

the availability of sufficient reliable data,

•

uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally,

•

our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data,

•

our ability to timely recognize changes in trend and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy,

•

our ability to predict changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable accuracy,

•

the development, selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies,

•

our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those innovations,

•

our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately,

•

unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action,

•

ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices,

•

changing driving patterns,

•

unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs, and

•

unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices.

The realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly
future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our volume and competitiveness. In either
event, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries,
constraining our ability to write new business.

Our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims
accurately.

Our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will
pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. There is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves, which can arise
from a number of factors, including:

•

the availability of sufficient reliable data,

•

the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends in multiple markets,

•

unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs,

•

unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations,

•

new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions by courts,

•

inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and changing theories of liability,

•

ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices,

•

the accuracy of our estimates of the frequency or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements,

•

the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and

•

the accuracy of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims.

As a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps
substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. Consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse
effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position. Further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” discussion beginning on page 8 of this
report, as well as our “Report on Loss Reserving Practices,” which was filed with the SEC on Form 8-K on June 30, 2008.

Likewise, we must
accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience and skill of our claims representatives, the extent of and our ability to recognize
fraudulent claims, the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our
concierge-level claims services program. Our failure to pay claims fairly and accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand
image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our financial results, prospects and liquidity.


Our financial performance may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic
losses.

Catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather
and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities. The extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of
both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. In addition, our business could be further impaired if a significant portion of our business or systems were shut down by, or if we were
unable to gain access to certain of our facilities as a result of, such an event. Most of our past catastrophe-related claims have resulted from severe storms. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. When they occur
with enough severity, our financial performance, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Our business depends
on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions, including our information technology and other business systems.

Our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions (such as Internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business,
and processing and paying claims and other obligations. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage, or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems for any
reason, including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded, could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications
systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business
interruption, system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions. This
could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill.

Our business is
highly dependent on access to, and the performance of, the financial markets to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis. Disruptions in financial markets, or an interruption or breakdown in
the federal wire transfer systems, could limit our ability to meet payment obligations. A mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs, or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed, could also
adversely affect our ability to make timely payments.

A security breach of our computer systems or other operations could also interrupt or damage our
operations; infect, corrupt or destroy data or systems; subject us to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated; and significantly damage our reputation. Despite the implementation of security measures, including hiring an
independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems, these systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems.
Any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We rely heavily on credit card acceptance for premium payment and settlement of claims deductibles. Data security standards for merchants and service providers that
accept credit card payments are prescribed by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI), an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors. These standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures to
help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information by companies accepting credit card payments. In September 2008, an independent organization recognized by PCI for such purposes certified Progressive as being in compliance with the current PCI
standards. The PCI data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and recertification of our processes. Our intention is to
maintain compliance with PCI’s data security standards. The failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments.

II.

Investing Risks

The performance of our fixed-income and
equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks.

Our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income
securities and common equities. Our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities and preferred stocks. The performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a
number of risks, including:

•

Interest rate risk

– the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in the market interest rates.

•

Credit risk

– the risk that the value of certain investments may become impaired due to the deterioration in financial condition of, or the liquidity
available to, one or more issuers of those instruments or, in the case of asset-backed


securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent
loss.

•

Concentration risk

– the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries, which
could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition, performance or outlook of those issuers, sectors or industries.

•

Prepayment or extension risk

(applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) – the risk that, as
interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, or that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of or income from such securities and the portfolio.

•

Liquidity risk

– the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on short notice, or that we will
not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so. Disruptions in the financial markets, or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices
to levels that are not acceptable to us.

In addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income
portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. The fixed-income portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if there is a lack of transparency regarding the businesses of issuers of securities that we purchase, if credit
ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized credit rating agencies are based on incomplete information or prove unwarranted, or if our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions, among other
factors.

The common equity portfolio, which is managed by a third party to track the Russell 1000 index, is subject to general movements in the values of
equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. An investment that is designed to track an index such as the Russell 1000 does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other
equity investment strategies. Equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to periods of high volatility and may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, discussed above. For
example, a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall, particularly those of interest-sensitive companies. In addition, even though the Russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be
concentrated in one or more sectors, such as the financial services industry, which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio when such a sector underperforms. A decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up
the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio.

Both the fixed-income and the common equity
portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets. The functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them may be adversely affected if those markets
are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation:

•

local, national or international events, such as power outages, system failures, wars or terrorist attacks;

•

a recession, depression or other adverse developments in either the U.S. or other economies that adversely affects the value of corporate, municipal and
asset-backed securities held in our portfolio;

•

financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial
instruments, such as derivative transactions, which could further disrupt the markets or cause us to incur losses if counterparties to one or more of our transactions should default;

•

inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and
impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired;

•

the failure, or perceived failure, of governmental attempts to stabilize specific companies or groups of companies through capital injections, to shore up markets
or otherwise to spur economic recovery or growth, or the government fails or refuses to engage in such efforts;

•

a significant change in inflation expectations, or the onset of deflation or stagflation; and

•

a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events.

If the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to be impaired by market, sector or issuer-specific conditions to a substantial degree, our liquidity, financial
position and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported
earnings and capital levels. A decrease in value of an insurance company’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements. If we, at that time, are unable to supplement
the subsidiary’s capital from The Progressive Corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected.


See

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

in our Annual
Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2008 and on the market risk associated with our investment portfolio.

III.

Financing Risks

Our insurance subsidiaries may be limited
in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders, repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or
affiliate.

The Progressive Corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable
to pay dividends or make other distributions to The Progressive Corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, Progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations,
repurchase its common shares, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate. Each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors:

•

State insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus.

•

State regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company.

•

Competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings.

•

In certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from state regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other
distributions to affiliated entities, including the holding company.

Further information on state insurance laws and regulations which
may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in Item 5(c), “Dividends,” herein.

The Progressive
Corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed.

We have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income
by a percentage factor set by the Board of Directors (20% for each of 2008 and 2009) and then by the Gainshare factor (determined under our employee Gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance
businesses). To the extent our after-tax comprehensive income, which includes net investment income, realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses, is less than after-tax underwriting income, no
dividend will be payable. For 2008, this calculation resulted in no dividend being paid to shareholders.

Because the dividend calculation is
performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). As a result, the amount paid may be
inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations. In addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2009 (to be paid early in 2010), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the Board until December
2009, and the Board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2009 or future years. Such an action by the Board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or
capital needs, changes in federal income tax laws, or disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under “Investing Risks.” Any such change could
adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our stock.

Our financial
condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts becomes insolvent, experiences other financial hardship or defaults in the performance of contractual obligations.

Our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual relationships. These include, for example, contracts
for the acquisitions of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support, and other services that are integral to our operations), private labeling arrangements and arrangements for transferring certain
of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). In addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial instruments, such as derivative
transactions, with major banks or other financial institutions. If one or more of these parties were to default on the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system,
product or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses, operational problems and brand risk, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows or results of operations and cause
damage to our reputation.


If we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow
could be adversely affected.

We intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to support the
growth of our insurance businesses, and to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses. The appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based, in part, on current and anticipated business
results and growth prospects, and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level prescribed by management. The amount of capital that we seek to maintain is driven by our assessment of
potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing and operating risks, including those discussed in these Risk Factors. The estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and
modeling of the types of risks that we are likely to face. While our techniques for estimating our capital needs are continually enhanced, our ability to predict accurately the nature, size and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain.

The amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by the performance of our insurance operations and investing results (including
investment income, valuation changes in our portfolio, and the realization of any deferred tax benefits), as well as by our capital management activities, such as the payment of cash dividends, repurchases of our common shares, the establishment of
credit lines and the issuance by us of debt, equity or other securities. If we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio, our capital levels may be reduced, perhaps significantly. If our capital level turns out
to be lower than the amount needed at a given time, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected and our ability to grow the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are found. Such a
deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by third parties (such as rating agencies, underwriters, and institutional and other investors), and as a result, our ability to gain access to debt or
equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted, and the price of our common shares could fall significantly.

In addition, the
recoverability of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that in part depend on substantial recovery to original cost for our fixed-income securities and redeemable
preferred stocks. Should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value, a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary, which would reduce our capital levels.

Our access to capital markets, our ability to enter into new financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and our
business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies.

Our credit and financial strength is
evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and A.M. Best. Progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. Downgrades in our credit
ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected). Perceptions of our company by
investors, producers, other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired. In addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post collateral in amounts then owed to the
other party in cash or high grade assets. Downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. In any such event, our financial
performance could be materially adversely affected.

We do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term
value of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results.

We believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long
run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. We do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or
otherwise. We also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. As a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors’ expectations,
which could result in significant volatility in our stock price.

In addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake
business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term position, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term performance, such as our annual
underwriting profit or earnings per share. Such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. Consequently, these strategies may adversely
affect short-term performance and may result in additional volatility in our stock price.

PROPERTIES

All of our properties are owned or leased by
subsidiaries of The Progressive Corporation. Progressive’s corporate headquarters is located on a 42-acre parcel in Mayfield Village, Ohio. We also have a 72-acre corporate office complex near the headquarters. Buildings on these two sites
contain approximately 1.6 million square feet of office space.

We also own: seven other buildings in Cleveland, Ohio suburbs near the corporate
office complexes; four buildings in Tampa, Florida; five buildings in Colorado Springs, Colorado; and a building in each of the following cities: Albany, New York; Ft. Lauderdale, Florida; Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania; Tempe, Arizona; and Tigard,
Oregon. Two of these buildings are partially leased to non-affiliates. In total, these buildings contain approximately 2.0 million square feet of office, warehouse, and training facility space. These facilities are occupied by our business
units or other supporting operations and are not segregated by industry segment. We also own 57 acres of vacant land in Mayfield Village and 15 acres in Colorado Springs near our corporate facilities.

We own 40 buildings and lease another 13 to provide concierge-level claims service at various locations throughout the United States. In addition, our facility in Tempe,
Arizona is also partially used as a claims service center. In total, these additional buildings contain approximately .8 million square feet.

We
lease approximately 1.2 million square feet of office and warehouse space at various locations throughout the United States for our business units and corporate functions. In addition, we lease approximately 460 claims offices, consisting of
approximately 3.3 million square feet, at various locations throughout the United States. These leases are generally short-term to medium-term leases of standard commercial office space.

SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no
matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2008.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

Incorporated by reference from information with respect to executive officers of The Progressive Corporation and its subsidiaries set forth in Item 10 in Part III of
this Form 10-K.


PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

(a) Market Information

Progressive’s Common Shares, $1.00 par
value, are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PGR. The high and low prices set forth below are as reported on the consolidated transaction reporting system.

The closing price of our Common Shares on January 31, 2009, was $12.15.

(b) Holders

There were 3,840 shareholders of record on
January 31, 2009.

(c) Dividends

See the table
above for the frequency and amount of cash dividends paid on our Common Shares, $1.00 par value, for the last two years.

During 2006, Progressive’s
Board of Directors approved a plan to replace our previous quarterly dividend policy with an annual variable dividend beginning in 2007. The annual variable dividend is based on a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a
target percentage factor and then by a companywide performance factor (known as our Gainshare factor). For 2007, 2008, and 2009, the Board determined the target percentage of after-tax underwriting income to be 20%. The Gainshare factor can range
from zero to two and is determined by comparing operating performance for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives. The Gainshare factor is also used in connection with our cash bonus program for employees and is
approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board annually. To the extent the Gainshare factor was zero or if comprehensive income (which includes net investment income as well as both realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains
and losses during the period) was less than after-tax underwriting income, no annual variable dividend would be paid. In addition, although it is our intent to calculate an annual dividend based on the formula outlined, the Board could decide to
alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2009 or future years, at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year. Such an action by the Board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace,
changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our business, liquidity, or financial position. Based on our 2008 results, our
after-tax comprehensive loss was less than after-tax underwriting income, therefore, the Board of Directors determined that no dividend would be paid for 2008.

In June 2007, the Board declared an extraordinary dividend of $2.00 per common share. The extraordinary dividend was part of a plan to restructure our capital position during the year and is described in

Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

To the extent we
elect to defer the payment of interest on our 6.70% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067, we may be restricted from declaring any dividends. See

Note 4 – Debt

in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit
13 to this Form 10-K for further discussion. Our intent is to pay interest on the Debentures as and when due.


Consolidated statutory policyholders’ surplus was $4.5 billion on December 31, 2008, and $4.6 billion on
December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, $469.8 million of consolidated statutory policyholders’ surplus represented net admitted assets of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate that are required to meet minimum
statutory surplus requirements in such entities’ states of domicile. Generally, the net admitted assets of insurance companies that, subject to other applicable insurance laws and regulations, are available for transfer to the parent company
cannot include the net admitted assets required to meet the minimum statutory surplus requirements of the states where the companies are licensed. The companies may be licensed in states other than their states of domicile, however, which may have
higher minimum statutory surplus requirements. Based on the dividend laws currently in effect, the insurance subsidiaries may pay aggregate dividends of $505.5 million in 2009 without prior approval from regulatory authorities, provided the dividend
payments are not within 12 months of previous dividends paid by the applicable subsidiary.

(d) Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity
Compensation Plans

The following information is set forth with respect to our equity compensation plans at December 31, 2008.

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION


These plans have expired and no further awards may be made thereunder.

(e) Performance Graph

Incorporated by reference from the

Performance Graph

section in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

(f) Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

None.


(g) Share Repurchases

ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Progressive’s financial policies state that we will repurchase shares to neutralize dilution from
equity-based compensation in the year of issuance and to return underleveraged capital to investors. See

Note 9—Employee Benefit Plans

, “Incentive Compensation Plans” in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to
this Form 10-K, for a summary of our restricted stock grants.

In June 2007, the Board approved an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million
common shares. This Board authorization will expire on June 30, 2009. Shares repurchased under this authorization may be accomplished through open market purchases or otherwise, and may include trading plans entered into with one or more
brokerage firms in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In the fourth quarter 2008, all repurchases were accomplished through the open market in conjunction with our incentive compensation plans.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The accompanying condensed
financial statements of The Progressive Corporation (parent company) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of The Progressive Corporation and subsidiaries’ Annual Report to Shareholders,
which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

Note 1. Statements of Cash Flows

— For the purpose of the Statements of Cash Flows, cash
includes only bank demand deposits. The Progressive Corporation does not hold any cash but has unrestricted access to funds maintained in a non-insurance, investment subsidiary to meet its holding company obligations; at year-end 2008, $1.0 billion
of marketable securities were available in this company. The Progressive Corporation paid income taxes of $258.0 million in 2008, $526.0 million in 2007, and $739.0 million in 2006, respectively. Total interest paid was $144.7 million in 2008,
$110.1 million in 2007, and $81.3 million in 2006. Non-cash activity includes declared but unpaid dividends, changes in the net unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities, and the contribution from The Progressive Corporation of its common
shares to certain subsidiaries, subject to restricted stock awards granted to employees. In addition, in 2006, non-cash activity included the reclass of the liability for deferred restricted stock compensation due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R).

The Progressive Corporation effected a 4-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend to shareholders on May 18, 2006. We reflected the issuance
of the additional common shares by transferring $585.9 million from retained earnings to the common stock account. All share, per share, and equivalent share amounts and stock prices were adjusted to give effect to the split. Treasury shares were
not split.

Note 2. Income Taxes

— The Progressive Corporation files a consolidated federal income tax return with all subsidiaries and acts as
an agent for the consolidated tax group when making payments to the Internal Revenue Service. Income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Balance Sheets are comprised of the parent company’s net deferred tax assets offset by the consolidated
group’s net income taxes payable/recoverable. The Progressive Corporation and its subsidiaries have adopted, pursuant to a written agreement, a method of allocating consolidated federal income taxes. Amounts allocated to the subsidiaries under
the written agreement are included in “Intercompany Receivable” in the accompanying Condensed Balance Sheets.

Note 3. Investment in
Consolidated Subsidiaries

— The Progressive Corporation, through its investment in consolidated subsidiaries, recognizes the changes in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities of the subsidiaries. These amounts were:
