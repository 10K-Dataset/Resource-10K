PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

(a) General Development of Business

The Progressive insurance organization began business in 1937. The Progressive Corporation, an
insurance holding company formed in 1965, currently has 67 subsidiaries and 1 mutual insurance
company affiliate. Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate provide personal and
commercial automobile insurance and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related
services throughout the United States. Our property-casualty insurance products protect our
customers against collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles, uninsured and underinsured
bodily injury, and liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising out of the
use of those vehicles. Our non-insurance subsidiaries generally support our insurance and
investment operations.

(b) Financial Information About Segments

Incorporated
by reference from Note 9,

Segment Information

, beginning on
page App.-A-21 of
the Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

We offer a number of personal and commercial property-casualty insurance products primarily related
to motor vehicles. Net premiums written were $14.1 billion in 2006, compared to $14.0 billion in
2005 and $13.4 billion in 2004. Our combined ratio, calculated in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), was 86.7 in 2006, 88.1 in
2005 and 85.1 in 2004.

Organization

We write private passenger auto insurance policies in 49 states (all except Massachusetts) and the
District of Columbia. Auto insurance differs greatly by community because regulations and legal
decisions vary by state and because traffic, law enforcement, cultural attitudes, insurance agents,
medical services and auto repair services vary by community. To respond to these differences in
our Personal Lines product management areas, these 50 jurisdictions are organized into three
geographical regions. There are two General Managers in each region, one to handle the business
written through independent agents and one to handle the business written directly. Our Commercial
Auto Business is organized by product on a national basis, with state-level product managers
responsible for local implementation. In addition, to service our customers countrywide, the Claims
business area is organized into six geographical regions with a General Manager each responsible
for a different region. All of our business area General Managers report directly to the Group
Presidents (discussed below). Our business written through independent agents has its own Customer
Service units; our business written directly has Sales and Customer Service units. Both businesses
share claims loss reporting units that take initial claims reporting calls from customers. These
Customer Service groups are located at call centers in Mayfield Village, Ohio; Austin, Texas;
Tampa, Florida; Sacramento, California; Tempe, Arizona; and Colorado
Springs, Colorado.

Our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions and includes the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief
Information Officer and Chief Human Resource Officer, as well as our four Group Presidents (Agency,
Direct, Commercial Auto and



Claims). The Group Presidents are challenged to develop and manage
product offerings and customer service processes tailored to the unique requirements of customers
who select our

insurance products, buying policies through the distribution channel of
their choice.

Personal Lines

Our Personal Lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreational and
other vehicles. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each
program targeted to a specific distribution channel, market or
customer group. The Personal Lines Businesses
accounted for 86% of total net premiums written in 2006, compared to 87% in 2005 and 88% in 2004.
Our strategy is to be the low-cost provider of a full line of auto insurance products with superior
service, distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers.

We ranked third in industry market share for 2005 based on net premiums written, and believe that
we held this position for 2006. We compete with approximately 280 other insurance companies/groups
that each writes over $5 million of private passenger auto insurance premiums annually in the
United States. The top 15 private passenger auto insurers comprised about 75% of this market.
For 2006, the estimated industry net premiums written for personal auto insurance in the United
States was $161.1 billion, and our share of this market was approximately 7.6%, compared to $159.5
billion and 7.6%, respectively, in 2005, and $157.3 billion and 7.5% in 2004. Except as otherwise
noted, all industry data and our market share or ranking in the industry either were derived
directly from data reported by A.M. Best Company Inc. (“A.M. Best”) or were estimated using A.M.
Best data as the primary source.

Private passenger automobile insurance represented 91% of total Personal Lines net premiums written
by Progressive in 2006, compared to 92% in both 2005 and 2004. Our objective is to offer an
accurate rate for virtually all drivers. Volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness,
brand recognition and the actions of our competitors, among other factors. See “Competitive
Factors” on page 5 of this report for further discussion.

Our specialty Personal Lines products include insurance for motorcycles, recreational vehicles,
mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles and similar items. These products represented 9% of the
total Personal Lines net premiums written and are primarily distributed by independent agents and
brokers. Due to the nature of these products, we typically experience higher losses during the
warmer weather months. Our competitors are specialty companies and large multi-line insurance
carriers. Although industry figures are not available, based on our analysis of this market, we
believe that we are one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market. Based
on our review of the markets, we have determined that we have been the market share leader for
personal watercraft insurance since 2002 and for the motorcycle product since 1998.

We also started offering a personal umbrella insurance product in select markets in 2006. This
pilot program is currently being offered through certain independent agents to existing Agency
Business customers in five states. The pilot program will continue to be evaluated against certain
performance criteria before a decision is made as to whether to expand this product offering to
additional markets.

The Personal Lines business is generated either by independent agents and brokers or written
directly online or by phone. The Agency Business includes business written by our network of more
than 30,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United States, as well as
brokerages in New York and California. These independent insurance agents and brokers have the
ability to place business with Progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed
underwriting guidelines, subject to compliance with company-mandated procedures. Our guidelines
prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be
charged for specified categories of risk. The agents and brokers do not have authority on behalf of
Progressive to establish underwriting guidelines, develop rates, settle or adjust claims, or enter
into other transactions or commitments. The Agency Business also writes business through strategic
alliance business relationships with other insurance companies, financial institutions and national
brokerage agencies. In 2006, the total net premiums written through the Agency Business
represented 64% of our Personal Lines volume, compared to 66% in 2005 and 68% in 2004.

The Direct Business includes business written directly by us online and over the phone. Net
premiums written in the Direct Business were 36%, 34% and 32% of our Personal
Lines volume in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.



Commercial Auto

The Commercial Auto Business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles
and trucks owned by small businesses and represented 14% of our total net premiums written in 2006,
compared to 13% in 2005 and 12% in 2004. The majority of our Commercial Auto customers insure
three or fewer vehicles. The Commercial Auto Business, which is primarily distributed through the
independent agency channel, operates in the specialty truck and light and local commercial auto
markets. The specialty truck commercial auto market, which accounts for slightly more than half of
the total Commercial Auto premiums and approximately 40% of the vehicles we insure in this
business, includes dump trucks, logging trucks, tow trucks, local cartage and other short-haul
commercial vehicles. The remainder is in the light and local commercial auto market, which
includes autos, vans and pick-up trucks used by artisans, such as contractors, landscapers and
plumbers, and a variety of other small businesses. Although the Commercial Auto Business differs
from Personal Lines auto in its customer bases and products written, both businesses require the
same fundamental skills, including disciplined underwriting and pricing, as well as excellent
claims service. We compete on a countrywide basis with approximately 210 other companies/groups,
each with over $5 million of commercial auto premiums written annually. Our Commercial Auto
Business ranked third in market share on a national basis in 2005 based on direct written premiums,
and we believe that we are in a virtual tie with the other two companies as co-leaders in the
commercial auto insurance market for 2006.

Other Indemnity Businesses

Our other indemnity businesses, which represented less than 1% of our 2006, 2005 and 2004 net
premiums written, include providing professional liability insurance to community banks,
principally directors and officers liability insurance. We reinsure the majority of the risk on
these coverages with a small mutual reinsurer controlled by its bank customers and various other
reinsurance entities. The program, sponsored by the American Bankers Association, insures over
1,700 banks, representing every state. In addition, our other indemnity businesses include
managing our run-off businesses.

Service Businesses

Our service businesses include providing insurance-related services, primarily policy issuance and
claims adjusting services in 25 states for Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans (CAIP), which
are state-supervised plans serving the involuntary markets. We process approximately 50% of the
premiums in the CAIP market and compete with two other providers countrywide. As a service
provider, we collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related
policies. We cede 100% of the premiums and losses to the plans. Reimbursements to us from the
CAIP plans are required by state laws and regulations. Material violations of contractual service
standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business. We have
maintained, and plan to continue to maintain, compliance with these standards. Any changes in our
participation as a CAIP service provider would not materially affect our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. The service businesses represented less than 1% of our 2006,
2005 and 2004 revenues.

Our service business also includes our total loss concierge program. This program is primarily a
customer-service initiative, through which we help policyholders and claimants find and purchase a
replacement vehicle when their automobile is declared to be a total loss.

Claims

We manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 475 claims offices
located throughout the United States. In addition, we have in operation 53 centers, in 41
metropolitan areas across the country, that provide concierge-level claims service. These facilities are
designed to provide end-to-end resolution for auto physical damage losses. Customers can choose to
bring their vehicles to one of these sites, where they can pick up a rental vehicle. Our
representatives will then write the estimate, select a qualified repair shop and inspect the
vehicle once the repairs are complete. This service reforms the vehicle repair process, increases
consumer satisfaction, increases our productivity and improves the cycle time and quality of
repairs. Concierge-level of claims service is our primary approach to damage assessment and
facilitation of vehicle repairs in urban markets. We will continue to expand this service into
2007 and 2008, although at a slower pace, with approximately 18 new sites expected to be opened.



Competitive Factors

The automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets in which we operate are highly
competitive. Property-casualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price, consumer
recognition, coverages offered, claims handling, financial stability, customer service and
geographic coverage. Vigorous competition is provided by large, well-capitalized national
companies, some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents, and by
smaller regional insurers. Over the last few years, third party comparative rating services have
emerged, adding transparency to industry pricing, and many of our competitors have significantly
increased their advertising and marketing efforts and/or expanded their online service offerings,
further intensifying the competitive nature of the automobile and other property-casualty insurance
markets.

We rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and
price accurately according to risk potential. We have remained competitive by refining our risk
measurement and price segmentation skills, closely managing expenses and achieving operating
efficiencies. Superior customer service, fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand
recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy.

State Insurance Licenses

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance
authorities. These licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically, provided the
holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements. Our licenses govern the kinds of
insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state. Such
licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the
satisfaction of prescribed criteria. All licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’
businesses are in good standing.

Insurance Regulation

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by
insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact
business. At least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each
of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The nature and extent of such regulation and
supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, an insurance company is subject
to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile. Progressive’s insurance
subsidiaries and affiliate are domiciled in the states of Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan,
New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin. State insurance departments have broad
administrative power relating to licensing insurers and agents, regulating premium changes and
policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, prescribing statutory accounting methods and the
form and content of statutory financial reports, and regulating the type and amount of investments
permitted. Rate regulation varies from “use and file,” to “file and use,” to prior approval, to
mandated rates.

Insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies
maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards.
Insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the
insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business. Insurance departments
are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition
and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory
accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations.

Insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the
power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic
disclosure of certain information. These laws impose prior approval requirements for certain
transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and
other distributions, including loans and cash advances, between regulated insurers and their
affiliates. See the “Dividends” discussion in Item 5(c) for further information on these dividend
limitations.

Under state insolvency and guaranty laws, regulated insurers can be assessed or required to
contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of
other insurers. Insurers are also required by many states, as a condition of doing business in the
state, to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market. These
“assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and



the level of coverage which must
be offered to such involuntary risks, as well as the allowable premium. Many states also have
involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to
involuntary risks. These plans, through assessments, pass underwriting and administrative expenses
on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states.

Insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus
to support their writings. Progressive is in the process of slowly increasing operating leverage
through a higher ratio of net premiums written to surplus in our insurance subsidiaries where
permitted. Although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function
of a number of factors (including applicable law, the type of business being written, the adequacy
of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets), the annual net premiums that an
insurer may write have historically been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the
insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus, generally 3 to 1. At year-end 2006, the combined premiums
to surplus ratio for all Progressive insurance companies was 2.8 to 1. Thus, the amount of an
insurer’s surplus, in certain cases, may limit its ability to grow its business. The National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) also has developed a risk-based capital (RBC) program
to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that
show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition. RBC is a series of dynamic
surplus-related formulas which contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances
based on the degree of certain risks, such as asset, credit and underwriting risks. Progressive’s
RBC ratios are well in excess of minimum requirements.

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market. For
example, certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or non-renew policies.
Certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the
state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state
insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption.
Laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or non-renewal of policies, or that subject
program withdrawals to prior approval requirements, may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit
unprofitable markets or businesses.

Regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise.
Some changes may be due to economic developments, such as changes in investment laws made to
recognize new investment vehicles; other changes result from such general pressures as consumer
resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices
and solvency. In recent years, legislation, regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been
introduced, and in some cases adopted, which deal with use of non-public consumer information, use
of financial responsibility and credit information in underwriting, insurance rate development,
rate of return limitations, rate determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew
insurance policies, reflecting concerns about consumer privacy, coverage, availability, prices and
alleged discriminatory pricing. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and
certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine
whether federal regulation is necessary.

In a number of states, Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit
information (credit) as part of the underwriting or rating process. This practice is expressly
authorized by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, and our
information demonstrates that credit
is an effective predictor of insurance risk. The use of credit in underwriting and rating is the
subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity. Regulators and legislators have
expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit, including: questions regarding the
accuracy of credit reports, perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and
certain minority groups, the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit
and insurance risk, the treatment of persons with limited or no credit, the impact on credit of
extraordinary life events (e.g., catastrophic injury or death of a spouse), and the credit
attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers. A number of state insurance
departments have issued bulletins, directives or regulations to regulate the use of credit by
insurers. In addition, a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate
insurers’ use of credit. Also, Congress recently mandated that the federal government conduct a
disparate impact study of the use of credit. It is possible that Congress or one or more states
may enact further legislation affecting the use of credit in underwriting and rating following
completion of that study.

In some states, the automobile insurance industry has been under pressure in past years from
regulators, legislators or special interest groups to reduce, freeze or set rates to or at levels
that are not necessarily related to underlying



costs, including initiatives to roll back automobile
and other personal lines rates. This kind of activity has affected adversely, and in the future
may affect adversely, the profitability and growth of our subsidiaries’ automobile insurance
business in those jurisdictions, and may limit the subsidiaries’ ability to increase rates to
compensate for increases in costs. Adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the
subsidiaries’ ability to price automobile insurance adequately, or affecting the subsidiaries’
insurance operations adversely in other ways, may occur in the future. The impact of these
regulatory changes on the subsidiaries’ businesses cannot be predicted.

Statutory Accounting Principles

Our results are reported in accordance with GAAP, which differ in certain respects from amounts
reported under statutory accounting principles (SAP) prescribed by insurance regulatory
authorities. Certain significant differences are described below:

Category

GAAP Accounting

SAP Accounting

Acquisition Expenses

Commissions, premium
taxes and other
variable costs incurred
in connection with
writing new and renewal
business are
capitalized and
amortized pro rata over
the policy term as
premiums are earned.

Commissions, premium
taxes and all other
acquisition expenses
are expensed as
incurred.

Non-admitted Assets

Premium receivables are
reported net of an
allowance for doubtful
accounts.

Furniture, equipment,
application software,
leasehold improvements
and prepaid expenses
are capitalized and
amortized over their
useful lives or periods
benefited.

Deferred tax assets are
recorded based on
estimated future tax
effects attributable to
temporary differences.
A valuation allowance
is recorded for any tax
benefits that are not
expected to be
realized.

Premium receivables
over 90 days past due
are “non-admitted,”
which means they are
written off against
surplus. For premium
receivables less than
90 days past due, we
also estimate a bad
debt reserve.

Furniture, equipment,
application software,
leasehold improvements
and prepaid expenses
are non-admitted
against surplus.

Deferred tax assets
that do not meet
certain statutory
requirements for
recognition are
non-admitted against
surplus.

Reinsurance

Ceded reinsurance
balances are shown as
an asset on the balance
sheet as “prepaid
reinsurance premiums”
and “reinsurance
recoverables.”

Ceded reinsurance
balances are netted
with liabilities.
Ceded unearned premiums
are netted against the
unearned premium
liability. Ceded
unpaid loss and loss
adjustment expense
(LAE) amounts are
netted against loss and
LAE reserves. Only
ceded paid loss and LAE
are shown as a
reinsurance recoverable
asset.

Investment Valuation

Fixed maturity
securities, which are
classified as
available-for-sale, are
reported at current
fair values. Equity
securities are reported
at quoted fair values.

Fixed maturity
securities are reported
at amortized cost or
the lower of amortized
cost or fair value,
depending on the type
of security. Equity
securities are shown at
NAIC fair values.

Federal Income Taxes

Federal tax expense and
tax liability or
recoverable balances
include current and
deferred income taxes.

For income statement
reporting, federal tax
expense only includes
the current tax
provision. Deferred
taxes are posted to
surplus. SAP deferred
tax assets are subject
to certain limitations.

Investments

We employ a conservative approach to investment and capital management intended to ensure that we
have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premium that we can profitably write. Our
portfolio is invested primarily in short-term and intermediate-term, investment-grade fixed-income
securities. Our investment portfolio had a fair value of $14.7 billion at December 31, 2006,
compared to $14.3 billion at December 31, 2005. Investment income is affected by the variability
of cash flows to or from the portfolio, shifts in the type and quality of investments in the
portfolio, changes in yield and other factors. Investment income, including net realized gains
(losses) on securities, before expenses and taxes, was $638.1 million in 2006, compared to $498.8
million in 2005 and $563.7 million in 2004. For more detailed

Employees

The number of employees, excluding temporary employees, at December 31, 2006, was 27,778, all of
which were employed by subsidiaries of The Progressive Corporation.

Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

The consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss
adjustment expenses (LAE) of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries. Our objective is to ensure that
total reserves (i.e., case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves, or “IBNR”) are adequate
to cover all loss costs, while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially
established until losses are fully developed. The liabilities for losses and LAE are determined
using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net
cost of all unpaid losses and LAE incurred through December 31 of each year. These estimates are
subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement, among other factors. These estimates
are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.
Such adjustments, if any, are reflected in the current results of operations. A detailed
discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “Report on Loss Reserving
Practices,” which was filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) on Form 8-K on June 28, 2006, as well as in the “Critical
Accounting Policies” section of our

During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we experienced $246.9 million, $355.9 million and $109.1 million,
respectively, of favorable loss reserve development. The favorable development was driven by
actuarial adjustments, resulting from regularly scheduled actuarial reviews, as well as favorable
“all other development” (e.g., claims settling for more or less than reserved, emergence of
unrecorded claims at rates different than reserved and changes in reserve estimates by claims
representatives). The favorable “all other development” also reflected the continued recognition
of lower severity for prior accident years than had been previously estimated.
We conduct extensive reviews each month on portions of our business to help ensure that we are
meeting our objective of having reserves that are adequate, with minimal variation.

In establishing loss reserves, we take into account projected changes in average severities of
claims, which are caused by the anticipated effect of inflation and a number of factors that vary
with the individual type of policy written. Average severities are projected based on historical
trends adjusted for anticipated changes in



underwriting standards, inflation, policy provisions and
general economic trends. These anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual
development and are modified if necessary.

We have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material
effect on earnings or reserves.

Represents loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses
at the balance sheet date.


Cumulative development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and LAE — Net.

The above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and LAE from
1996 through 2005. The top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and
LAE recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the property-casualty
insurance subsidiaries only. This liability represents the estimated amount of losses and LAE for
claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date, including IBNR. The table also presents the
re-estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE on a gross basis, with separate disclosure of the
re-estimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses.

The upper section of the table (labeled “Paid (Cumulative) as of:”) shows the cumulative amount
paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year. The
lower portion of the table (labeled “Liability Re-estimated as of:”) shows the re-estimated amount
of the previously recorded liability based on



experience as of the end of each succeeding year.
The estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for
individual years. For example, as of December 31, 2006, our insurance subsidiaries had paid
$1,650.5 million of the currently estimated $1,675.5 million of losses and LAE that had been
incurred through the end of 1997; thus, an estimated $25.0 million of losses incurred through 1997
remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date.

The cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all
prior years. For example, the 1996 liability has developed favorably by $89.3 million over ten
years. That amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and did not have a significant
effect on the income of any one year. The effects on income during the past three years due to
changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and LAE are shown in the reconciliation table on
page 8 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and LAE.

In evaluating this information, note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects
of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods. For example, the amount of
the development related to losses settled in 1999, but incurred in 1996, will be included in the
cumulative development amount for years 1996, 1997 and 1998. Conditions and trends that have
affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future.
Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table.

We
experienced continually favorable reserve development from 1996 through 1998 primarily due to
decreasing bodily injury severity. The reserves established as of the end of each year assumed the
current accident year’s severity would increase over the prior
accident year’s estimate. From 1996
continuously through the third quarter 1998, our bodily injury severity decreased each quarter when
compared to the same quarter of the prior year. This period of decreasing severity for us was not
only longer than that experienced by the industry, but also longer than at any time in our recent
history. As the experience continued to be evaluated at later dates, the realization of the
decreased severity resulted in favorable reserve development. Late in 1998, we started
experiencing an increase in bodily injury severity. As a result, the reserve development for 1998
through 2001 has been much closer to our original estimate. Thereafter, we recognized lower
severity than what we expected when reserves were originally set, resulting again in favorable
development from 2002 through 2005.

(e) Available Information.

Our Web site is located at progressive.com. As soon as reasonably practicable, we make all
documents that we file with, or furnish to, the
SEC, including our reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, and any amendments
to these reports, available free of charge via our Web site at progressive.com/investors. These
reports are also available on the SEC’s Web site: sec.gov.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in
this section. Management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may
affect our ability to achieve our business objectives:

•

Operating Risks

are those stemming from external or internal events or circumstances
that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations.

•

Investing Risks

are uncertainties relating to the performance and preservation of our
investment portfolios. Unlike most other risks, the actual development of an investment
risk factor (such as whether



interest rates go down or up) may result in either an increase
or decrease in the value of investments we hold.

•

Financing Risks

generally relate to our ability to obtain capital, when necessary, to
pay or otherwise perform our obligations, including obligations under any debt instruments
issued, and to earn the cost of equity capital.

In addition, a fourth category of

Other Risks

is included below to highlight additional matters
that our shareholders should consider to better understand management’s long-term approach to the
business.

Although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below,
it should be noted that many of the risks have ramifications in more than one category. For
example, although presented as an Operating Risk below, state regulation of insurance companies may
also affect our investing and financing activities. Similarly, while setting insurance rates,
setting loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as Operating Risks, errors in
these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well. The categories,
therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us
and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed.

This information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in
this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the SEC, as well as news
releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional
risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may
also adversely affect our business. If any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following
risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, this could have a materially adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or results of operations. In that case, the market price of our
Common Shares could decline materially.

I.

Operating Risks

We compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly
competitive.

We face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national companies and smaller regional
insurers. Other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also
may enter these markets in the future. Many of these companies may have greater financial,
marketing and management resources than we have. In addition, competitors may offer consumers
combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not
offer. We could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business, or to retain a
sufficient percentage of our current customers, as a result of competitors offering similar
insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor
initiatives.

From time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive
position in auto insurance markets. Based on a culture that encourages innovation, these
strategies at times involve significant departures from our and/or our competitors’ then-current or
historical modes of doing business. As such, our innovations may entail a degree of risk and may
not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals. In addition, these initiatives may be subject
to challenge by regulators or private litigants and may disrupt our relationships with certain of
our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). If we are unable successfully to develop,
plan and implement our strategic initiatives in these competitive, regulatory and legal
environments, or if we are unable to identify effective strategies in the first instance to
maintain or enhance our competitive position, our business could be materially adversely affected.

Similarly, we undertake distinctive advertising campaigns and other efforts to improve brand
recognition, generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers. If these
campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, our business
could be materially adversely affected. We believe that improving the effectiveness of our
advertising campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the
recent increases in advertising and marketing efforts within the automobile insurance market.

The highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure
of one or more major competitors. In the event of a failure of a major insurer, we could be
adversely affected, as our company



and other insurance companies may be required under
state-mandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer, and we could be faced with an
unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders.

Our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers and executives, and to
maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success.

Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, including
executives and other key managers. Our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure
to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect
on our business.

In addition, we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments (for
multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our
hiring programs and/or employment levels accordingly. Our failure to recognize the need for such
adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead
either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing
(impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or
locations. In either such event, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.

We further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve
the staffing models and employee culture that we have developed over the years. Our ability to do
so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, legislation or regulations at the state or
federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace. In such events, the productivity of
certain of our workers could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating
performance and margins.

The Progressive Corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex
federal and state laws and regulations.

Progressive’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. Our insurance
subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50
states and the District of Columbia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and
regulations. In addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses,
including insurers. Our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations
at reasonable costs, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will
continue to be critical to our success.

Certain states impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by
regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate,
innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. Our compliance efforts are
further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies (such as,
in recent years, legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer
information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to
freeze, set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance
company may earn). Insurance laws and regulations may limit the insurance subsidiaries’ ability to
underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent the subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes
to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict the subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue
unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets or prevent insurers from terminating policies
under certain circumstances. In addition, compliance with insurance-related laws and regulations
often results in increased administrative costs to our insurance subsidiaries. These costs, in
turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the
applicable jurisdictions.

The failure to comply with these laws and regulations also could result in actions by regulators or
other law enforcement officials, potentially leading to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and
damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary’s
authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, The Progressive Corporation
and its subsidiaries can face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other
parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations.

During 2004 and 2005, we received document and information requests from several state attorneys
general and insurance regulators regarding investigations into the relationships between insurers
and brokers and agents, allegations of bid-rigging by certain brokers and other related matters.
We have not been notified by any governmental or regulatory authority that we are the target of any
such investigation. For a discussion of these



requests, see the “Financial Condition — Commitments
and Contingencies” section in

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

in the Annual Report, which is attached as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

New legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our
operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states. In addition, from time
to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition
of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. We are unable to
predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations
would affect our businesses.

State insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for Progressive’s insurance
subsidiaries in other ways as well. For further information on these risks and uncertainties, see
the “Insurance Regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report.

Lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies are
pending, and more may be filed in the future.

The Progressive Corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in putative class
action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations, and
such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. These
lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of after-market parts;
total loss evaluation methodology; use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the
federal Fair Credit Reporting Act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury,
personal injury protection and medical payment claims; and policy implementation and renewal
procedures, among other matters. From time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other
disputes alleging that our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent,
trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Additional litigation may be
filed against us concerning how we settle claims, our employment-related practices, medical
malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from the operation of our
business. In addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future,
against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation,
the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or
limitations on, the subsidiaries’ business operations.

Lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. Moreover, as courts resolve
individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields, a new layer of court-imposed
regulation could emerge, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. Such
litigation is inherently unpredictable. Except to the extent we have established reserves with
respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the
effect, if any, that these pending or future lawsuits may have on our business, operations,
profitability or financial condition. For further information on pending litigation, see Note 11,
Litigation, beginning on page App.-A.-23 of the Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to
this Form 10-K.

Our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to
policyholders.

Our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite
and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. The role of the pricing function is to
ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses, loss adjustment
expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit.

Our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:



The realization of such risks may result in our pricing being based on stale, inadequate or
inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions or methodologies, and may cause us to
estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, we could
underprice risks, which would negatively affect our margins, or we could overprice risks, which
could reduce our volume and competitiveness. In either event, our operating results, financial
condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, underpricing
insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance
subsidiaries, constraining our ability to write new business.

Our long-term growth prospects could be impacted by reduced accident frequency trends.

Auto accident frequency has steadily declined since 2000, contributing to lower insurance premiums
for many consumers. Although not conclusive, several contributors to reduced frequency include
improved vehicle safety, road design and driver education. We are not able to predict whether
frequency will continue to decline, will stabilize or will return to increasing trends more
consistent with the periods prior to 2000. If the recent trend continues, however, declining auto
accident frequency, if not offset by an increase in severity, could lead to a long-term reduction
in the amount of premiums written in the auto insurance industry, thus directly affecting our
ability to grow our auto insurance business revenues.

Our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims
accurately.

Our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts
that the subsidiaries will ultimately pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs
of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. There is inherent
uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves, which can arise
from a number of factors, including:

As a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss
adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses
and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements.
Consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially
adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position. Further information
on our loss reserves can be found in the “Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss
Adjustment Expenses” discussion beginning on page 8 of this report, as well as our “Report on Loss
Reserving Practices,” which was filed with the SEC on Form 8-K on June 28, 2006.

Likewise, we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many
factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training and experience of
our claims representatives, the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of our
management, our ability to develop or select and implement



appropriate procedures and systems to
support our claims functions and the success of our concierge-level claims services program. Our
failure to pay claims accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material
litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand
image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our financial results, prospects and liquidity.

Our financial performance may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or
other catastrophic losses.

Catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms,
earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions,
terrorist attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages or
interruptions of communications facilities. The extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a
function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature
and severity of the event. In addition, our business could be further impaired if a significant
portion of our business or systems were shut down by, or if we were unable to gain access to
certain of our facilities as a result of, such an event. Most of our past catastrophe-related
claims have resulted from severe storms, as evidenced recently by the active hurricane seasons in
2004 and 2005. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. When they
occur with enough severity, our financial performance, cash flows and results of operations could
be materially adversely affected.

Our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business
functions, including our information technology and other business systems.

Our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform, in an efficient and
uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as Internet support and 24-hour call
centers, processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims. A shut-down of or
inability to access one or more of our facilities, a power outage, or a failure of one or more of
our information technology, telecommunications or other systems for any reason, including failures
that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded, could significantly impair our
ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. In addition, because our information
technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we
could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party
system fails or experiences an interruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business
interruption, system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to
write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner
or perform other necessary business functions. This could result in a materially adverse effect on
our business results, prospects and liquidity.

A security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations or harm our
reputation. In addition, we could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is
misappropriated from our computer systems. Despite the implementation of security measures,
including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer
systems, these systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming
errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. Any compromise of security could
deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to
our systems, which could have a material, adverse effect on our business.

II.

Investing Risks

The performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to investment
risks.

Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including:

•

Interest rate risk

— the risk of adverse changes in the value of
fixed-income securities as a result of increases in the underlying
market rates, which is the most significant risk to the
fixed-income portfolio.

•

Credit risk

— the risk that the value of certain investments may
become impaired due to the deterioration in financial condition of
one or more issuers of those instruments and, ultimately, the risk
of permanent loss in the event of default by an issuer.

•

Concentration risk

— the risk that the portfolio may be too
heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers,
sectors or industries, which could result in a significant
decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a
deterioration of the financial condition of those issuers or the
market value of their securities.



•

Prepayment or extension risk

(applicable to certain securities in
the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) —
the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such
securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, adversely
affecting the value of or income from such securities and the
portfolio.

The common equity portfolio, which is managed to track the Russell 1000 index, is subject to
general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the
securities we hold. Equity markets and individual securities may be subject to periods of high
volatility. A decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be
expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio.

In addition, both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are subject to risks inherent
in the nation’s and world’s capital markets. The functioning of those markets, the values of the
investments we hold and our ability to liquidate investments on favorable terms on short notice may
be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by local, national or
international events, such as power outages, system failures, wars or terrorist attacks, recessions
or depressions, a significant change in inflation expectations, a significant devaluation of
governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events.

If the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to be impaired by market, sector or
issuer-specific conditions to a substantial degree, our liquidity, financial position and financial
results could be materially adversely affected. Under these circumstances, our income from these
investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could
further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. A decrease in value of an insurance
company’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy
regulatory minimum capital requirements. If we at that time are unable to supplement the
subsidiary’s capital from The Progressive Corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity
securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected.

III.

Financing Risks

Our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the
holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to
shareholders, repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or
affiliates.

The Progressive Corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own.
Consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to The
Progressive Corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, Progressive may be unable to pay
dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations,
repurchase its Common Shares, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries
or affiliates. Each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be
limited by one or more of the following factors:

•

State insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory
capital and surplus.

•

State regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus availability of
the insurance company.

•

Competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings.

•

In certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from state regulatory authorities for the insurance
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the holding company.

Further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our
insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in
Item 5(c), “Dividends,” on page 20 of this
report.

Our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into
significant contracts becomes insolvent or experiences other financial hardship.

Our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under
various contractual relationships, including without limitation, contracts for the acquisitions of
goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support,
and other services that are integral to our operations) and arrangements for transferring certain
of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products
and our corporate insurance policies). If one or more of these parties were



to default on the
performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or
terminate support for a system, product or service that is significant to our business, we could
suffer significant financial losses and operational problems, which could in turn adversely affect
our financial performance, cash flows or results of operations.

Our decision to retain a specific amount of capital that is not adequate to support our actual
business needs could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to grow.

We intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to
provide for the anticipated growth of our insurance businesses, and to provide for additional
protection against possible large, unexpected losses. The level of capital that is retained at any
time is determined by management based, in part, on current and anticipated business results, our
growth prospects, and estimates of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected
events. The estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of
extensive analysis and modeling of the types of risks that we are likely to face. If our actual
capital level turns out to be lower than is actually needed at a given time, our financial
condition could be materially adversely affected, our ability to grow the insurance business could
be constrained until additional sources of capital are found, and our ability to gain access to
debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted.

Our access to capital markets, our financing arrangements and our business operations are dependent
on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies.

Our credit strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor’s
and Moody’s Investors Service. In addition, the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries
is rated by A.M. Best. Progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable,
stable ratings. Downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the
capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates
we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected). Perceptions of our company by
investors, producers, other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired.
Downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our
operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. In either event, our
financial performance could be materially adversely affected.

IV.

Other Risks

We do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value
of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results.

We believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the
financial goals and policies that we establish each year. We do not manage our business to maximize
short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend paid under our annual variable dividend
policy. We also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings
estimates by analysts. As a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps
significantly, from investors’ expectations, which could result in significant volatility in our
stock price.

In addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business
strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance
our longer-term position, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit
short-term performance, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. Such
strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers to
support growth or enhance retention of current customers. Consequently, these strategies may
adversely affect short-term performance and may result in additional volatility in our stock price.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

We currently do not have any unresolved comments from the SEC staff.



ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

All of our properties are owned or leased by subsidiaries of The Progressive Corporation.

Progressive’s corporate headquarters are located on a 42-acre parcel in Mayfield Village, Ohio. We
also have a 72-acre corporate office complex near the headquarters. Buildings on these two sites
contain approximately 1.6 million square feet of office space.

We also own: seven other buildings in Cleveland, Ohio suburbs near the corporate office complexes;
four buildings in Tampa, Florida; five buildings in Colorado Springs, Colorado; and a building in
each of the following cities: Albany, New York; Ft. Lauderdale, Florida; Plymouth Meeting,
Pennsylvania; Tempe, Arizona; and Tigard, Oregon. Two of these buildings are partially leased to
non-affiliates. In total, these buildings contain approximately 2.0 million square feet of office,
warehouse and training facility space. These facilities are occupied by our business units or
other supporting operations and are not segregated by industry segment.

The building in Tempe, Arizona is also partially used as a claims service center. In addition, we
own 33 buildings and lease another 19 to provide concierge-level claims service at various
locations throughout the United States. In total, these additional buildings contain approximately .8 million square feet. We will continue to expand this service into 2007 and 2008, although at a
slower pace, with approximately 18 new sites expected to be opened.

We lease approximately 1.3 million square feet of office and warehouse space at various locations
throughout the United States for our business units and corporate functions. In addition, we lease
approximately 475 claims offices, consisting of approximately 3.5 million square feet, at various
locations throughout the United States. These leases are generally short-term to medium-term
leases of standard commercial office space.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

None. For
a discussion of litigation we currently face, see Note 11,

Litigation

, beginning
on page App.-A-23 of the Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

On
February 22, 2007, a jury in the Federal District Court in
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, rendered a verdict in the amount of
$61 million against one of our subsidiaries in an individual
employment-related case brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964. All actions under Title VII are subject to a statutory
cap on compensatory and punitive damages of $300,000 (excluding
damages for front pay, back pay and attorneys fees, which were not
covered by the jury’s verdict and will be decided separately by
the Court). We, therefore, believe that the jury’s determination
is contrary to law and also believe that
the verdict was not supported by the facts presented to the Court. We
will pursue available remedies to have the verdict overturned or
reduced to an amount in conformance with the statutory cap, and we
believe that any liability in this case will not materially impact
our financial condition, cash flows or results or operations.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

(b) Holders

(c) Dividends

See the table above for the frequency and amount of cash dividends paid on our Common Shares, $1.00
par value, for the last two years.

During 2006, Progressive’s Board of Directors approved a plan to replace our previous dividend
policy in 2007 with an annual variable dividend, payable shortly after the close of each year.
This change is described in

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

, beginning on page App.-A-28 of our 2006 Annual Report, which is included
as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

Consolidated statutory policyholders’ surplus was $5.0 billion on December 31, 2006, and $4.7
billion on December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, $475.5 million of consolidated statutory
policyholders’ surplus represented net admitted assets of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and
affiliate that are required to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements in such entities’ states
of domicile. Generally, the net admitted assets of insurance companies that, subject to other
applicable insurance laws and regulations, are available for transfer to the parent company cannot
include the net admitted assets required to meet the minimum statutory surplus requirements of the
states where the companies are licensed. The companies may be licensed in states other than their
states of domicile, however, which may have higher minimum statutory surplus requirements. Based
on the dividend laws currently in effect, the insurance subsidiaries may pay aggregate dividends of
$1.4 billion in 2007 without prior approval from regulatory authorities, provided the dividend
payments are not within 12 months of previous dividends paid by the applicable subsidiary.

SCHEDULE II — CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT (Continued)

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The accompanying condensed financial statements of The Progressive Corporation should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of The Progressive
Corporation and subsidiaries included in Progressive’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is
included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

Note 1 Statement of Cash Flows

— For the purpose of the Statements of Cash Flows, cash includes
only bank demand deposits. The Progressive Corporation does not hold
any cash since its funds are maintained in a non-insurance,
investment subsidiary. The Progressive Corporation has unrestricted
access to these funds to meet its holding company obligations. The Progressive Corporation paid income taxes of $739.0 million in
2006, $767.0 million in 2005 and $709.0 million in 2004, respectively. Total interest paid was
$81.3 million in 2006 and $85.0 million in 2005 and $91.6 million in 2004. Non-cash activity
includes the liability for deferred restricted stock compensation (prior to the adoption of SFAS
123(R)) and the contribution from The Progressive Corporation of its Common Shares to certain
subsidiaries, subject to restricted stock awards granted to employees.

The Progressive Corporation effected a 4-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend to
shareholders on May 18, 2006. We reflected the issuance of the additional Common Shares by
transferring $585.9 million from retained earnings to the common stock account. All share, per
share and equivalent share amounts and stock prices were adjusted to give effect to the split.
Treasury shares were not split.

The
Progressive Corporation previously classified dividends received from
consolidated subsidiaries (i.e., dividend income) as an investing
activity and cash loaned to a subsidiary as a financing activity. The
Progressive Corporation revised these classifications to instead
appropriately disclose
dividend income as an operating activity and loans to a subsidiary as
an investing activity in 2006, with conforming changes in 2005 and
2004.

Note 2
Income Taxes

— The Progressive Corporation files a consolidated federal income tax return
with all subsidiaries and acts as an agent for the consolidated tax
group when making payments to the Internal Revenue Service. Income
taxes in the accompanying Condensed Balance Sheets are comprised of
the parent company’s net deferred tax assets offset by the
consolidated group’s net income taxes payable/recoverable. The Progressive Corporation and its subsidiaries have adopted, pursuant to
a written agreement, a method of allocating consolidated Federal income taxes. Amounts allocated
to the subsidiaries under the written agreement are included in Intercompany Receivable in the
accompanying Condensed Balance Sheets.

Note 3 Investments in Consolidated Subsidiaries

— The Progressive Corporation, through its
investment in consolidated subsidiaries, recognizes the changes in unrealized gains (losses) on
available-for-sale securities of the subsidiaries. These amounts were:

deferred compensation is incorporated by reference from Note 8,

Employee Benefit Plans

,
beginning on page App.-A-17 of the Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form
10-K.

Note 6
Reclassifications

— In the Condensed Statements of Income, “Deferred compensation-stock
price appreciation (depreciation)” was reclassified out of “Other operating costs and expenses.”
There was no impact on total expenses or total net income.
