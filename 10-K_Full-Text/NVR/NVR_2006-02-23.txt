Business.

General

NVR, Inc. (“NVR”) was formed in 1980 as NVHomes, Inc. NVR operates in two business
segments, homebuilding and mortgage banking. NVR conducts its homebuilding activities
directly, except for Rymarc Homes which is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary, and its
mortgage banking operations which is operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary, NVR
Mortgage Finance, Inc. (“NVRM”). Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “NVR”,
“we”, “us” or “our” include NVR and its subsidiaries.

We are one of the largest homebuilders in the United States and in the Washington, D.C.
and Baltimore, MD metropolitan areas. While we operate in multiple locations in thirteen
states, primarily in the eastern part of the United States, approximately 38% of our home
settlements in 2005 occurred in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD metropolitan areas,
which accounted for 52% of our 2005 homebuilding revenues. Our homebuilding operations
include the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium
buildings under four trade names: Ryan Homes, NVHomes, Fox Ridge Homes, and Rymarc Homes. The
Ryan Homes, Fox Ridge Homes, and Rymarc Homes products are moderately priced and marketed
primarily to first-time homeowners and first-time move-up buyers. The Ryan Homes product is
currently sold in twenty-one metropolitan areas located in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia,
Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Michigan
and Kentucky. The Fox Ridge Homes product is sold solely in the Nashville, TN metropolitan
area and the Rymarc Homes product is sold solely in the Columbia, South Carolina market. The
NVHomes product is marketed primarily to move-up and upscale buyers and is sold in the
Washington, D.C., Baltimore, MD, Philadelphia, PA and the Maryland Eastern Shore metropolitan
areas. In 2005, our average price of a unit settled was approximately $375,000.

We do not engage in the land development business. Instead, we acquire finished building lots
at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements that
require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement. The deposits
required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying
amounts and represent a percentage, typically ranging up to 10%, of the aggregate purchase price of
the finished lots.

Our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with
direct land ownership and land development. We may, at our option, choose for any reason and at
any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to
acquire the finished lots under contract. Our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure
to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the
liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements. We do not have any
financial guarantees or completion obligations and, with the exception of three specific
performance contracts for 80 lots existing at December 31, 2005, we do not guarantee specific
performance under these purchase agreements. We generally seek to maintain control over a supply
of lots believed to be suitable to meet our sales objectives for the next 24 to 36 months.

On a very limited basis, NVR also obtains finished lots using joint venture limited liability
corporations (“LLC’s”). All LLC’s are structured such that NVR is a non-controlling member and is
at risk only for the amount invested. NVR is not a borrower, guarantor or obligor on any of the
LLC’s debt. NVR enters into a standard fixed price purchase agreement to purchase lots from these
LLC’s. At December 31, 2005, NVR had an aggregate investment in thirteen separate LLC’s
totaling approximately $15 million, which controlled approximately 1,000 lots.


In addition to building and selling homes, we provide a number of mortgage-related
services through our mortgage banking operations. Through operations in each of our
homebuilding markets, NVRM originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers. NVRM
generates revenues primarily
from origination fees, gains on sales of loans and title fees. NVRM sells all of the mortgage
loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis.

Segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Homebuilding

Products

We offer single-family detached homes, townhomes, and condominium buildings with many
different basic home designs. These home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous
other options. Our homes combine traditional or colonial exterior designs with contemporary
interior designs and amenities, generally include two to four bedrooms, and range from
approximately 1,000 to 7,300 square feet. During 2005, the prices of our homes ranged from
approximately $90,000 to $2,000,000.

Markets

We operate in the following geographic regions:

Washington:

Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and adjacent counties in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia

Baltimore:

Baltimore, MD metropolitan area and adjacent counties in Pennsylvania

North:

Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland Eastern Shore, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania

South:

North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Richmond, VA

Further discussion of settlements, new orders and backlog activity by region for each of
the last three years can be found in

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

(see Item 7 of this report).

Backlog

Backlog totaled 8,310 units and approximately $3.7 billion at December 31, 2005 compared
to backlog of 7,372 units and approximately $2.9 billion at December 31, 2004. Our
cancellation rate was approximately 12% during 2005. Assuming that our cancellation rate in
2006 is consistent with that experienced in 2005, approximately 88% of the units in backlog at
December 31, 2005 will settle in 2006. However, we can provide no assurance that our
historical cancellation rate is indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in
2006. See Risk Factors in Item 1A.

Construction

We utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction
work on our homes. The subcontractors’ work is performed under the supervision of our
employees who monitor quality control. We use many independent subcontractors in our various
markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of
subcontractors.

Land Development

We are not in the land development business. We purchase finished lots from various land
developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited
if we fail to perform under the agreement. The deposits required under the purchase agreements
are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage,
typically ranging up to 10%, of the
aggregate purchase price of the finished lots. We are not dependent on any single developer
or on a small number of developers.


Sales and Marketing

Our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring
many built-in options and a landscaped lot. The garages of these model homes are usually
converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed
and designs for other models are available for review. Sales representatives are compensated
predominantly on a commission basis.

Regulation

NVR and its subcontractors must comply with various federal, state and local zoning,
building, environmental, advertising and consumer credit statutes, rules and regulations, as
well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales
activities. All of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our
products, and in some instances, have delayed our developers’ abilities to deliver us finished
lots. Counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the
issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage
treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards. To date,
restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse
effect on our construction activities. However, in certain markets in which we operate, we
believe that our growth has been hampered by the longer time periods necessary for our
developers to move projects through the approval process.

Competition and Market Factors

The housing industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous homebuilders of
varying size, ranging from local to national in scope, some of which have greater financial
resources than we do. We also face competition from the home resale market. Our homebuilding
operations compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service and
reputation. We historically have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where
we build homes.

The housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels,
prevailing economic conditions and interest rates. Other factors that affect the housing
industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and increases in the cost of
land, labor and materials; changes in consumer preferences; demographic trends and the
availability of mortgage finance programs.

We are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials.
Whenever possible, we utilize standard products available from multiple sources. In the
past, such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply.

Mortgage Banking

We provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through
our mortgage banking operations. Our mortgage banking operations also include separate
subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with
mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees. Because NVRM originates
mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers, NVRM is dependent on our
homebuilding segment. In 2005, NVRM closed approximately 11,300 loans with an aggregate
principal amount of approximately $3.4 billion.

NVRM sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a
servicing released basis, typically within 30 days from the loan closing. NVRM is an approved
seller/servicer for FNMA, GNMA, FHLMC, VA and FHA mortgage loans.


Competition and Market Factors

NVRM’s main competition comes from national, regional, and local mortgage bankers,
mortgage brokers, thrifts and banks in each of these markets. NVRM competes primarily on the
basis of customer service, variety of products offered, interest rates offered, prices of
ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs.

Regulation

NVRM is an approved seller/servicer of FNMA, GNMA, FHLMC, FHA and VA mortgage loans, and
is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations. These rules and regulations
restrict certain activities of NVRM. NVRM is currently eligible and expects to remain
eligible to participate in such programs. In addition, NVRM is subject to regulation at the
state and federal level with respect to specific origination, selling and servicing practices.

Pipeline

NVRM’s mortgage loans in process that have not closed (“Pipeline”) at December 31, 2005
and 2004, had an aggregate principal balance of $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.
Our cancellation rate was approximately 25% in 2005. Assuming that the cancellation rate in
2006 is consistent with that experienced in 2005, approximately 75% of the Pipeline at
December 31, 2005 is expected to close in 2006. However, we can provide no assurance that the
prior year cancellation rate is indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in
2006. See Risk Factors in Item 1A.

Employees

At December 31, 2005, we employed 5,401 full-time persons, of whom 2,151 were officers
and management personnel, 345 were technical and construction personnel, 1,039 were sales
personnel, 823 were administrative personnel and 1,043 were engaged in various other service
and labor activities. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement
and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our employee relations are
good.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

Forward-Looking Statements

Some of the statements in this Form 10-K, as well as statements made by NVR, Inc. (“NVR”)
in periodic press releases or other public communications, constitute “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Certain, but not necessarily all, of such forward-looking statements
can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as “believes,” “expects,”
“may,” “will,” “should,” or “anticipates” or the negative thereof or other comparable
terminology. All statements other than of historical facts are forward looking statements.
Forward looking statements contained in this document include those regarding market trends,
NVR’s financial position, business strategy, projected plans and objectives of management for
future operations. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results or performance of NVR to be
materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by
the forward-looking statements. Such risk factors include, but are not limited to the
following: general economic and business conditions (on both a national and regional level);
interest rate changes; access to suitable financing; competition; the availability and cost
of land and other raw materials used by NVR in its homebuilding operations; shortages of
labor; weather related slow-downs; building moratoriums; governmental regulation; the
ability of NVR to integrate any acquired business; fluctuation and volatility of stock and
other financial markets; and other factors over which NVR has little or no control.

RISK FACTORS

Our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction
business, including, but not limited to:

•

actual and expected direction of interest rates, which affect our costs,
the availability of construction financing, and long-term financing for potential
purchasers of homes;

•

the availability of adequate land in desirable locations on reasonable terms;

•

unexpected changes in customer preferences; and

•

changes in the national economy and in the local economies of the markets
in which we have operations.

Interest rate movements, inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business.

High rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their
adverse impact on interest rates. High interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds
to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of
permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers. We are also subject to potential
volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding
business. Increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our
sales, profitability, stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations.

Our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage
banking business, including interest rate levels, the impact of government regulation on mortgage
loan originations and servicing
and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans. Our homebuilding
customers accounted for almost all of our mortgage banking business in 2005. The volume of our
continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business.


Our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets
such as negative changes in employment levels, job growth, and consumer confidence, one or all of
which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels. Such negative trends
could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations.

Our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations. We also may
experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are
unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward
commitments from third parties to purchase such loans. Increases in interest rates may have a
material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue, profitability, stock performance and
ability to service our debt obligations.

These factors and thus, the homebuilding business, have at times in the past been cyclical in
nature. Any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we
operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance and
ability to service our debt obligations. In particular, approximately 38% of our home settlements
during 2005 occurred in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD metropolitan areas, which accounted
for 52% of our 2005 homebuilding revenues. Thus, we are dependent to a significant extent on the
economy and demand for housing in those areas.

Our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our
operations.

The results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to
control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations. There can be no assurance
that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to
those available in the past, or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital
to controlling building lots than we have historically. An insufficient supply of building lots in
one or more of our markets, an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely
fashion, or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a
material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance and ability to service our
debt obligations.

If the market value of our inventory declines, our profit could decrease.

Inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders. The market value of building lots and
housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions. In
addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly
performing project or market. We must, in the ordinary course of our business, continuously seek
and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and
expansion within our current markets. In the event of significant changes in economic or market
conditions, we may dispose of certain subdivision inventories on a bulk or other basis which may
result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, stock performance
and ability to service our debt obligations.

Our current indebtedness may impact our future operations and our ability to access necessary
financing.

Our homebuilding operations are dependent in part on the availability and cost of working
capital financing, and may be adversely affected by a shortage or an increase in the cost of such
financing. If we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our
credit facility, we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or
to obtain alternative financing. No assurance can be given that additional or replacement
financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable. If we are at any time
unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures, we may
experience a substantial delay in the completion of any homes then under construction. Any delay
could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales,
profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.


Our existing indebtedness contains financial and other restrictive covenants and any future
indebtedness may also contain covenants. These covenants include limitations on our ability, and
the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends and make
distributions, make loans and investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, effect certain
asset sales, incur certain liens, merge or consolidate with any other person, or transfer all or
substantially all of our properties and assets. Substantial losses by us or other action or
inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants
which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our indebtedness, thereby having a
material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance and ability to service our
debt obligations.

Our mortgage banking operations are dependent on the availability, cost and other terms of
mortgage warehouse financing, and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of
such financing. No assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be
available on terms that are favorable or acceptable. Our mortgage banking operations are also
dependent upon the securitization market for mortgage-backed securities, and could be materially
adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market.

Government regulations and environmental matters can negatively affect our operations.

We are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations
concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulations
that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that
can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area. We have from time to time been
subject to, and may also be subject in the future to, periodic delays in our homebuilding projects
due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate. Changes in regulations that restrict
homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse
effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations.

We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and
regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. We are subject to a variety
of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects. The
particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to
the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site
and adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, cause us to
incur substantial compliance and other costs, or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding
activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas, thereby adversely affecting our
sales, profitability, stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations.

We are an approved seller/servicer of FNMA, GNMA, FHLMC, FHA and VA mortgage loans, and are
subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations. Any significant impairment of our
eligibility to sell/service these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage
operations. In addition, we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect
to specific origination, selling and servicing practices. Adverse changes in governmental
regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business.

We face competition in our housing and mortgage banking operations.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous homebuilders of
varying size, ranging from local to national in scope, some of whom have greater financial
resources than we do. We face competition:

•

for suitable and desirable lots at acceptable prices;

•

from selling incentives offered by competing builders within and
across developments; and

•

from the existing home resale market.

Our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design,
quality, service and reputation. Historically we have been one of the leading homebuilders in each
of the markets where we
operate.


The mortgage banking industry is also competitive. Our main competition comes from national,
regional and local mortgage bankers, thrifts, banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets.
Our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service, variety of
products offered, interest rates offered, prices of ancillary services and relative financing
availability and costs.

There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or
mortgage banking operations. An inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our
sales, profitability, stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations.

A shortage of building materials or labor may adversely impact our operations.

The homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor
shortages, including shortages in insulation, drywall, certain carpentry work and concrete, as well
as fluctuating lumber prices and supply. In addition, high employment levels and strong
construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and
us in one or more of our markets. Significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages,
or delays in construction of homes, could have a material adverse effect upon our sales,
profitability, stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations.

Product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations.

Construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk
for the homebuilding industry. The cost of insuring against construction defect and product
liability claims, as well as the claims themselves, can be high. In addition, insurance companies
limit coverage offered to protect against these claims. Further restrictions on coverage
available, or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect
on our financial results.

Weather-related and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations.

Extreme weather or other events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, forest
fires, floods, terrorist attacks or war, may affect our markets, our operations and our
profitability. These events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or
subcontractors, causing us material increases in costs, or delays in construction of homes,
which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales, profitability, stock performance
and ability to service our debt obligations.

Item 2.

Properties.

Our corporate offices are located in Reston, Virginia, where we currently lease
approximately 61,000 square feet of office space. The current executive office lease expires
in April 2015.

We lease manufacturing facilities in the following six locations: Thurmont, Maryland;
Burlington County, New Jersey; Farmington, New York; Kings Mountain, North Carolina;
Darlington, Pennsylvania; and Portland, Tennessee. These facilities range in size from
approximately 40,000 square feet to 400,000 square feet and combined total approximately
1,000,000 square feet of manufacturing space. All of our manufacturing facilities are leased.
Each of these leases contain various options for extensions of the lease and for the purchase
of the facility. The Portland lease expires in 2009. The Thurmont and Farmington leases
expire in 2014, and the Kings Mountain and Burlington County leases expire in 2023 and 2024,
respectively. The Darlington lease expires in 2025.

We also lease office space in multiple locations for homebuilding divisional offices and
mortgage
banking and title services branches under leases expiring at various times through 2011, none
of which are individually material to our business. We anticipate that, upon expiration of
existing leases, we will be able to renew them or obtain comparable facilities on acceptable
terms.


Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

(in thousands)

We are involved in various claims and litigation arising principally in the ordinary
course of business. At this time, we are not involved in any legal proceedings that we
believe are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations.

In April 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified NVR
that the Company was allegedly in violation of Section 308(a) of the Clean Water Act (the
“Act”) at a construction site in Pennsylvania relative to storm water management during the
homebuilding construction process. The notice informed NVR that the Company might be subject
to administrative fines of up to $157 for the alleged violations. Subsequently, in September
2005, NVR received a request from the EPA pursuant to the Act for information about storm
water discharge practices utilized in connection with other recent homebuilding projects
undertaken by the Company. NVR is working with the EPA to provide the requested information
and to review NVR’s compliance with the Act. It is not known at this time whether the EPA
will seek to take legal action or impose penalties in connection with the alleged violation at
the construction site in Pennsylvania.

As of the close of business on February 10, 2006, there were 489 shareholders of
record.

We have never paid a cash dividend on our shares of common stock. In addition, we do not
expect to pay a cash dividend in the foreseeable future as we continue with our objective of
increasing shareholder value by using earnings to fund continued growth in our homebuilding
and mortgage banking operations. We may from time to time repurchase shares of our common
stock to also further that objective. Our bank indebtedness contains certain restrictive
covenants, which limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock. See further
discussion of the covenants in the Liquidity section of Part II, Item 7 of the Form 10-K.

We had two repurchase authorizations outstanding during the quarter ended December 31,
2005. On July 28, 2005 (the “July Authorization”) and November 3, 2005 (the “November
Authorization”), we publicly announced the Board of Director’s approval for us to purchase up
to an aggregate of $300 million of our common stock in one or more open market and/or
privately negotiated transactions under each of the two authorizations. Neither the July
Authorization nor the November Authorization has an expiration date. During the quarter ended
December 31, 2005, we completed the utilization of the July Authorization. The following

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003

Overview

Our primary business is the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes
and condominium buildings. To fully serve our homebuilding customers, we also operate a mortgage
banking and title services business. We primarily conduct our operations in mature
supply-constrained markets. Additionally, we generally grow our business through market share
gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active
markets. We currently operate in the following regions:

Washington:

Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and adjacent counties in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia

Baltimore:

Baltimore, MD metropolitan area and adjacent counties in Pennsylvania

North:

Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland Eastern Shore, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania

South:

North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Richmond, VA


We believe we operate our business with a conservative operating strategy. We do not engage
in land development and primarily construct homes on a pre-sold basis. This strategy allows us
to maximize inventory turnover, which enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less
capital, thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital. In addition, we focus on
obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve. This strategy
allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets, which we
believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides
growth opportunities within these markets.

Because we are not active in the land development business, our continued success is
contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build, and
on our developers’ ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our
customers. Timely delivery of lots by our developers can be influenced by many factors, such as
the developer’s execution of improvements, weather-related impacts, and the length of time
necessary to obtain governmental approval of projects. We have been impacted in the past year
and may be negatively impacted in the future by development delays.

We acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under
fixed price purchase agreements (“purchase agreements”). These purchase agreements require
deposits in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform
under the purchase agreement. However, we believe that this lot acquisition strategy reduces
the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development. As
of December 31, 2005, we controlled approximately 105,000 lots with deposits in cash and letters
of credit totaling approximately $600,000 and $17,000, respectively. We also controlled
approximately 1,000 lots through investments in joint venture limited liability corporations.

Consolidated revenues and net income for 2005 increased 22% and 33%, respectively, from
2004. The increase in net income coupled with our continuing share repurchase program
resulted in a 35% increase in diluted earnings per share in 2005 compared to 2004. The
increase in consolidated revenues was primarily driven by our homebuilding business where we
experienced an 8% increase in the number of homes settled and a 13% increase in the average
settlement price in 2005 from 2004. In addition, the value of homes in backlog at December
31, 2005 exceeded the December 31, 2004 backlog value by 26%.

Revenues

Homebuilding revenues for 2005 increased 22% from 2004, primarily as a result of a 13%
increase in the average settlement price and an 8% increase in the number of homes settled.
Each of these increases was driven by a stronger backlog, both in value and units, at the
beginning of 2005 as compared to the beginning of 2004 due to the company’s overall growth and
our ability to raise prices year over year during a period of strong housing demand. We
experienced increased home settlements year over year in each of our regions except Baltimore
where settlements declined slightly from the prior year. Settlements in the Baltimore region
were negatively affected by development delays throughout the first three quarters of 2005.
The Baltimore region was able to resolve several of these development delays in the fourth
quarter, and settlements for this region increased 24% in the fourth quarter of 2005 as
compared to the same period in 2004.

Homebuilding revenues for 2004 increased 18% from 2003, primarily as a result of a 12%
increase in the average settlement price to $332.2 in 2004 from $297.9 in 2003 and an increase
of 6% in the number of homes settled to 12,749 in 2004 from 12,050 in 2003. The increase in
average settlement prices was primarily attributable to a 9% higher average price of homes in
backlog entering 2004 as compared to 2003 and to a 16% increase in the average price of homes
sold during the first six months of 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003. The increase
in the number of homes settled was primarily attributable to an 8% higher backlog at the
beginning of 2004 as compared to the beginning of 2003.

New Orders

The number of new orders for 2005 increased 11% from 2004, and the value of new orders
for 2005 increased 23% to $5,928,815 from $4,817,780 in 2004. The increase in the number of
new orders was primarily attributable to an overall increase in the average number of active
communities to 522 in 2005 as compared to 450 in 2004. Strong new order growth was
experienced in each of our regions except the Washington region, which remained relatively
flat with the prior year. Sales in the Washington region were negatively impacted by lower
sales absorption during the second half of the year as compared to the same period in 2004 as
a result of generally weaker market conditions within the region. The 23% increase
in the value of new orders was attributable to both the aforementioned increase in the number
of new orders and sustained housing demand year over year, which provided us the opportunity
to raise selling prices, resulting in an 11% increase in the average selling price in 2005 as
compared to 2004.


The number of new orders for 2004 increased 5% from 2003, while the value of new
orders for 2004 increased 22% to $4,817,780 from $3,950,413 in 2003. The increase in the
number of new orders was attributable to an overall increase in the average number of active
communities to 450 in 2004 as compared to 433 in 2003. Increases year over year in new orders
in the Washington, North and South regions were offset partially by a 9% decrease in new
orders for the Baltimore region. This decrease resulted primarily from a 7% decrease in the
average number of active communities in the Baltimore region year over year, attributable
primarily to development delays. The 22% increase in the value of new orders was primarily
attributable to the aforementioned increase in the number of new orders and strong housing
demand which provided us the opportunity to raise selling prices, resulting in a 16% increase
in the average selling price in 2004 as compared to 2003.

Gross Profit

The increase in gross profit margins of 210 basis points (2.1%) in 2005 from 2004 was
primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in average settlement prices year over
year. These increases were partially offset by higher land and building commodity prices in
2005 as compared to 2004. Many of the end product building supplies used in our construction
operations are impacted by higher, more volatile energy and petroleum costs, including: OSB
sheathing; siding material; PVC piping, paint; asphalt; shingles; cement; gypsum; steel; glass
and insulation. We are actively engaged in managing these cost increases to minimize their
potential margin impact. However, gross margins in future periods may be adversely impacted
by these higher costs, as well as expected pricing pressures in 2006 in many of our markets.

Gross profit margins for 2004 increased to 25.7% compared to 24.7% for 2003. The
increase in profit margins was attributable to the favorable market conditions allowing us to
increase sales prices in a majority of the markets leading to the aforementioned 12% increase
in average settlement prices in 2004 as compared to 2003. These increases were partially
offset by higher land, lumber and other commodity prices in 2004 as compared to 2003.

Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”)

SG&A for 2005 increased $84,630, or 32% from 2004, and as a percentage of revenues,
increased to 6.7% in 2005 from 6.1% in 2004. The increase in SG&A costs was primarily
attributable to increases in personnel costs and selling and marketing costs of approximately
$43,400 and $26,500, respectively. Personnel costs have increased primarily as a result of
increased wages and management incentive compensation due to increased staffing levels to
support our growth strategy. As of December 31, 2005, SG&A staffing levels had increased
approximately 23% from December 31, 2004. The increase in selling and marketing costs were
attributable to an increase in advertising and selling support costs due to the aforementioned
increase in the average number of active communities year over year. SG&A costs in 2006 will
be negatively impacted as a result of the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, (“SFAS 123R”), from which we expect to record after
tax expense of approximately $36,000 for the year, based on unvested stock options outstanding
at December 31, 2005 (see Recent Accounting Pronouncements section which follows within Item 7
for further discussion).

SG&A for 2004 increased 12% from 2003, but as a percentage of revenues, decreased to 6.1%
in 2004 from 6.4% in 2003. The increase in SG&A costs was primarily attributable to increased
personnel costs and selling and marketing costs of approximately $11,500 and $10,400,
respectively, due to our continued growth.


Backlog

Backlog units and dollars were 8,310 and $3,673,221, respectively, at December 31, 2005
compared to backlog units of 7,372 and dollars of $2,906,041 at December 31, 2004. The
increase in backlog units was due primarily to a 10% increase in the number of new orders for
the six-month period ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the same period ended December 31,
2004. The 26% increase in backlog dollars was attributable to the 13% increase in backlog
units and a 7% increase in the average price of new orders for the six-month period ended
December 31, 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004.

Backlog units and dollars were 7,372 and $2,906,041, respectively, at December 31, 2004
compared to backlog units of 6,890 and dollars of $2,323,703 at December 31, 2003. The
increase in backlog units was due primarily to a 6% increase in the number of new orders for
the six-month period ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the same period ended December 31,
2003. The 25% increase in backlog dollars was attributable to the 7% increase in backlog
units and a 16% increase in the average price of new orders for the six-month period ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003.

Mortgage Banking Segment

NVR conducts its mortgage banking activity through NVR Mortgage Finance, Inc. (“NVRM”), a
wholly owned subsidiary. NVRM focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer
base. Following is a table of financial and statistical data for the three years ended December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003:

$

76,647

Loan closing volume for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased 25% from 2004. The 2005
increase was primarily attributable to a 15% increase in the average loan amount, and a year over
year 9% increase in the number of units closed. The increase in the average loan amount reflects
the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s average selling prices. The unit
increase for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects an increase in the number of settlements by
the homebuilding segment and an increase in the percentage of the number of loans closed for NVR’s
homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home (“Capture Rate”).

Segment income for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased approximately $6,900 from 2004.
The increase was primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking fees attributable to the
aforementioned increase in closed loan volume. This was net of an approximate $6,000 increase in
general and administrative expenses during 2005. The increase in general and administrative
expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other personnel costs due to a 26%
increase in the total number of NVRM employees in 2005 versus 2004. The additional staffing is to
position NVRM for future growth and to increase the Capture Rate.

Traditionally, adjustable rate mortgages and brokered mortgages have been generally less
profitable products than fixed rate mortgages. During 2004 and early 2005, we saw a shift to these
less profitable products. However, in the second half of 2005, with the change in interest rates,
the differential between fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages narrowed, and we are now
experiencing a favorable product mix shift back to fixed rate mortgages. We expect this product
mix shift to continue into 2006.

Mortgage loans held for sale increased approximately $55,000 at December 31, 2005 compared to
December 31, 2004. This was primarily due to a 46% increase in the December 2005 loan closing
volume


compared to December 2004. Mortgage loans held for sale are typically sold to third-party
investors within 30 days from date of closing.

Loan closing volume for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased 14% from 2003. The 2004
increase is primarily attributable to a 12% increase in the average loan amount, and a year over
year 2% increase in the number of units closed. The increase in the average loan amount reflects
the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s average selling prices. The unit
increase for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflects an increase in the number of settlements by
the homebuilding segment and a slight increase in the Capture Rate.

Segment income for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased approximately $6,900 from 2003.
The decrease was primarily due to a product mix shift during 2004 from fixed rate mortgages to
adjustable rate mortgages and brokered mortgages. The decrease was also due to higher costs
incurred of approximately $3,400 related to the contractual repayment of loan sale income to
investors for loans that were paid in full within a set number of days following the sale of the
loan. The decreases due to the product mix shift and contractual repayments was partially offset
by the higher 2004 loan volume. General and administrative expenses also increased by
approximately $1,800 from 2003 to 2004, largely due to an 15% increase in the total number of NVRM
employees in 2004 versus 2003.

Seasonality

Overall, we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales, settlements or
loan closings.

Effective Tax Rate

Our consolidated effective tax rates were 39.0%, 40.0%, and 39.7% in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2005 was primarily due to the favorable tax
impact of the new Internal Revenue Code Section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction
established by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
2004),

Share-Based Payment

, (“SFAS 123R”). SFAS 123R is a revision of SFAS 123 and supersedes APB
No. 25. SFAS 123R requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be
recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in
accounting for share-based payment arrangements. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange
Commission amended the effective date for SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R is now effective as of the
beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period of a registrant’s first fiscal year
beginning on or after June 15, 2005. SFAS 123R applies to all awards granted, modified,
repurchased or cancelled after the effective date, and all outstanding portions of awards granted
prior to the effective date which are unvested as of the effective date of the pronouncement.

Entities may adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R using either the modified prospective or
modified retrospective methods. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost is
recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which
the requisite service has not yet been rendered, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards
calculated under SFAS 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosure. For periods before the
required effective date, the modified retrospective application may be applied to either (a) all
prior years for which SFAS 123 was effective or (b) only to prior interim periods in the year of
initial adoption, on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods
by SFAS 123. SFAS 123R becomes effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2006. We plan
to adopt the SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method. We expect our full year after tax
expense to be approximately $36,000 in 2006 related to the implementation of SFAS 123R, based on
unvested stock options outstanding at December 31, 2005.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Lines of Credit and Notes Payable

Our homebuilding segment generally provides for its working capital cash requirements
using cash generated from operations and a short-term unsecured working capital revolving
credit facility (the “Facility”). During 2005, we increased the available borrowings under
the Facility to $400,000 from $150,000 by refinancing our previous working capital agreement.
The current Facility now provides for borrowings of up to $400,000 subject to certain
borrowing base limitations. The Facility expires in December 2010 and outstanding amounts
bear interest at either (i) the prime rate plus an Applicable Margin (as defined within the
Facility) based on NVR’s credit rating and/or debt to capital ratio or (ii) London Interbank
Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) plus applicable margin as defined above. The weighted-average
interest rates for the amounts outstanding under the Facility were 5.9% and 4.0% for 2005 and
2004, respectively. Up to $150,000 of the Facility is currently available for issuance in the
form of letters of credit, of which $26,412 was outstanding at December 31, 2005. The
Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include
among others, certain limitations on transactions involving the creation of guarantees, sale
of assets, acquisitions, mergers, investments and land purchases. Additional covenants
include (i) a minimum adjusted consolidated tangible net worth requirement (ii) a maximum
leverage ratio requirement, and (iii) an interest coverage ratio requirement. These covenants
restrict the amount in which we would be able to pay in dividends each year. We are also
subject to borrowing base restrictions if our senior debt rating falls below investment grade.
At December 31, 2005 we were in compliance with all covenants under the Facility and there
were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available to us for borrowings. At
December 31, 2005, we had direct borrowings outstanding under the Facility of $103,000.

NVR’s mortgage banking segment provides for its mortgage origination and other operating
activities using cash generated from operations as well as various short-term credit
facilities. NVRM has available an annually renewable mortgage warehouse facility (the
“Revolving Credit Agreement”) with an aggregate borrowing limit of $175,000. This limit was
temporarily increased to $225,000 on December 15, 2005 to accommodate heavy year-end closing
volume. The borrowing limit reverted back to $175,000 on January 15, 2006. The Revolving
Credit Agreement is used to fund NVRM’s mortgage origination activities, under which $156,816 was
outstanding at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, borrowing base limitations reduced
the amount available to NVRM for borrowings to approximately $184,500. The Revolving Credit
Agreement expires in August 2006. The interest rate under the Revolving Credit Agreement is
either: (i) LIBOR plus 1.125%, or (ii) 1.125% to the extent that NVRM provides compensating
balances. The weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Agreement was 4.4% during 2005. NVRM’s mortgage warehouse facility limits the ability
of NVRM to transfer funds to NVR in the form of dividends, loans or advances. In addition,
NVRM is required to maintain a minimum net worth of $14,000. NVRM also currently has
available an aggregate of $50,000 of borrowing capacity in an uncommitted gestation and
repurchase agreement. Amounts outstanding under the uncommitted gestation and repurchase
agreement accrue interest at various rates tied to the LIBOR rate and are collateralized by
gestation mortgage-backed securities and whole loans. There were no borrowings under this
uncommitted facility during 2005.

On January 20, 1998, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for the issuance of up to $400,000 of debt securities (the “1998
Shelf Registration”). The 1998 Shelf Registration statement was declared effective on February
27, 1998 and provides that securities may be offered from time to time in one or more series, and
in the form of senior or subordinated debt.

On June 17, 2003, we completed an offering, at par, for $200,000 of 5% Senior Notes due 2010
(the “Notes”) under the 1998 Shelf Registration. The offering of the Notes resulted in aggregate
net proceeds of approximately $199,400, after deducting offering expenses. The Notes mature on
June 15, 2010 and bear interest at 5%, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December
15, commencing on December 15, 2003.


The Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and
indebtedness under our working capital credit facility. The Notes are senior in right of payment
to any future subordinated indebtedness that we may incur. We may redeem the Notes, in whole or
in part, at any time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price
equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, or (b) the
discounted present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the Notes to be redeemed, plus,
in each case, accrued and unpaid interest.

On July 14, 2003, we used approximately $120,700 of the proceeds received from the sale of
the Notes to redeem all of the $115,000 outstanding 8% Senior Notes due 2005 at a price of 104%
of the principal amount outstanding, including the payment of accrued interest. The redemption
resulted in a charge to pre-tax homebuilding income of $8,503.

On May 27, 2004, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “2004 Shelf Registration”)
with the SEC to register up to $1,000,000 for future offer and sale of debt securities, common
shares, preferred shares, depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants. The
SEC declared the 2004 Shelf Registration effective on June 15, 2004. NVR expects to use the
proceeds received from future offerings issued under the 2004 Shelf Registration for general
corporate purposes. In addition, we have $55,000 remaining available for issuance under the
1998 Shelf Registration. This discussion of our shelf registration capacity does not
constitute an offer of any securities for sale.

Equity Repurchases

In addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations, we
historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding
shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions. This ongoing
repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced Board authorizations, and is
typically executed in accordance with the safe-harbor provisions of Rule 10(b)-18 of the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934. The repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary
objective, creating increases in shareholder value. See Part II, Item 5 of the Form 10-K for
disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2005. For the year ended December
31, 2005, we repurchased approximately 1,269,000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate
purchase price of $962,609. We repurchased approximately 162,000 shares of our common stock at an
aggregate purchase price of $120,818 during January 2006, which fully utilized all available share
repurchase authorizations.

Cash Flows

As shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31,
2005, our operating activities provided cash of $532,772. Cash was provided primarily by
homebuilding operations and by the realization of a tax benefit of approximately $94,000 from
employee stock-based compensation activities. These tax benefits were recorded directly to
equity and reduced estimated tax payments during the year. Cash was also provided by a
$53,000 increase in customer deposits resulting primarily from the increase in backlog units
in 2005 as compared to 2004. Cash was used primarily to fund increases in homebuilding and mortgage loan inventory
of approximately $202,000 and $55,000, respectively, and to make deposits on fixed price
purchase agreements with developers to acquire control of finished lots. The increase in
contract land deposits of approximately $196,000 related to both payments for new, fixed price
purchase agreements and to scheduled payments under existing contracts upon achievement of
development milestones. We control approximately 105,000 lots at December 31, 2005, as
compared to approximately 83,500 lots at December 31, 2004.

Net cash used for investing activities was $22,097 for the year ended December 31, 2005,
primarily as a result of approximately $19,000 in property and equipment purchases throughout
the period. In addition, on January 1, 2005 we purchased substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Marc Homebuilders, Inc., a homebuilder in Columbia, South
Carolina for $7,600 in cash (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). The
acquired business operates under the Rymarc trade name.


Net cash used for financing activities was $700,514 for the year ended December 31, 2005,
primarily as a result of our ongoing common stock repurchase program, offset by a net increase
of approximately $249,000 under our credit lines. We repurchased approximately 1,269,000
shares of our common stock in 2005 for an aggregate purchase price of $962,609.

At December 31, 2005, the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments had restricted cash
of $5,135 and $1,738, respectively, which includes certain customer deposits, mortgagor tax
escrows, insurance escrows, completion escrows and other amounts collected at closing which
relates to mortgage loans held for sale and to home sales.

We believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our credit
facilities and the public debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and longer term cash
requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage
banking operations.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Lot Acquisition Strategy

We do not engage in the land development business. Instead, we acquire finished building lots
at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements that
require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement. The deposits
required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying
amounts and represent a percentage, typically ranging up to 10%, of the aggregate purchase price of
the finished lots.

Our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with
direct land ownership and land development. We may, at our option, choose for any reason and at
any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to
acquire the finished lots under contract. Our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure
to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the
liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements. We do not have any
financial guarantees or completion obligations and, with the exception of three specific
performance contracts for 80 lots at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $7,100 existing
at December 31, 2005, we do not guarantee specific performance under these purchase agreements.

At December 31, 2005, we controlled approximately 105,000 lots with an aggregate purchase
price of approximately $10,000,000, by making or committing to make deposits of approximately
$831,000 in the form of cash and letters of credit. Our entire risk of loss pertaining to the
aggregate $10,000,000 contractual commitment resulting from our non-performance under the contracts
is limited to the $831,000 deposit amount. Of the $831,000 deposit total, approximately $600,000
in cash and approximately $17,000 in letters of credit have been issued as of December 31, 2005,
and $214,000 will be paid subsequent to December 31, 2005, assuming that contractual development
milestones are met by the developers (see Contractual Obligations section below). Please refer to
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy
in relation to our accounting under FIN 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.

Bonds and Letters of Credit

We enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities, government
agencies, or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts. We had
$33,325 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of December 31, 2005 (inclusive of the
$17,000 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above). We believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do
not anticipate any losses under these bonds or letters of credit.


Mortgage Commitments and Forward Sales

In the normal course of business, our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual
commitments to extend credit to buyers of single-family homes with fixed expiration dates. The
commitments become effective when the borrowers “lock-in” a specified interest rate within time
frames established by us. All mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the
extension of the commitment. To mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in
providing rate lock commitments to borrowers, we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward
sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgage-backed securities to broker/dealers. The forward
sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific
rate lock commitments classified as derivatives. Both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and
the forward sale contracts to broker/dealers are undesignated derivatives, and, accordingly, are
marked to market through earnings. At December 31, 2005, there were contractual commitments to
extend credit to borrowers aggregating approximately $140,000, and open forward delivery sale
contracts aggregating approximately $322,000.

(d)(*)

Amounts represent required payments of forfeitable deposits with land developers under
existing, fixed price purchase agreements, assuming that contractual development milestones
are met by the developers. We expect to make all payments of these deposits within the next
three years but due to the nature of the contractual development milestones that must be met,
we are unable to accurately estimate the portion of the deposit obligation that will be made
within one year and that portion that will be made within one to three years. In addition to
the $214,000 to be paid pursuant to the prior discussion, as of December 31, 2005, we had
capitalized forfeitable deposits for fixed price purchase agreements with developers totaling
$599,530, and outstanding letters of credit of approximately $17,000.

(e)

We have entered into employment agreements with four of our executive officers. Each of the
agreements expires on January 1, 2011 and provides for payment of a minimum base salary, which
may be increased at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of NVR’s Board of Directors
(the “Compensation Committee”), and annual incentive compensation of up to 100% of base salary
upon achievement of annual performance objectives established by the Compensation Committee.
The agreements also provide for payment of severance benefits upon termination of employment,
in amounts ranging from $0 to two times the executive officer’s then annual base salary,
depending on the reason for termination, plus up to $60 in outplacement assistance.
Accordingly, total payments under these agreements will vary based on length of service, any
future increases to base salaries, annual incentive payments earned, and the reason for
termination. The agreements have been reflected in the above table assuming the continued
employment of the executive officers for the full term of the respective agreements, and at
the executive officers’ current base salaries. The above balances do not include any
potential annual incentive compensation. The actual amounts paid could differ from that
presented.

(f)

Amounts represent payments due under incentive compensation plans and are included on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, $3,730 of which is recorded in the Mortgage Banking accounts
payable and other liabilities line item.


Critical Accounting Policies

General

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. We continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated
financial statements, and update those estimates as necessary. In general, our estimates are based
on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and other various
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results
could differ materially from those estimates made by management.

Variable Interest Entities

Revised Financial Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46R”),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities

, which was effective for us as of March 31, 2004, requires the primary beneficiary of a
variable interest entity to consolidate that entity on its financial statements. The primary
beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the variable
interest entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns,
or both, as a result of ownership, contractual, or other financial interests in the entity.
Expected losses are the expected negative variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets
exclusive of its variable interests, and expected residual returns are the expected positive
variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets, exclusive of its variable interests.

Forward contracts, such as the fixed price purchase agreements utilized by us to acquire
finished lot inventory, are deemed to be variable interests under FIN 46R. Therefore, the
development entities with which we enter fixed price purchase agreements are examined under FIN 46R
for possible consolidation by us, including certain joint venture limited liability corporations
(“LLC’s”) utilized by us to acquire finished lots on a limited basis. We have developed a
methodology to determine whether we, or, conversely, the owner(s) of the applicable development
entity, are the primary beneficiary of a development entity. The methodology used to evaluate our
primary beneficiary status requires substantial management judgment and estimates. These judgments
and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative
to the development entity’s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes
in the fair value of finished lots under contract. Although we believe that our accounting policy
is designed to properly assess our primary beneficiary status relative to our involvement with the
development entities from which we acquire finished lots, changes to the probabilities and the cash
flow possibilities used in our evaluation could produce widely different conclusions regarding
whether we are or are not a development entity’s primary beneficiary, possibly resulting in
additional, or fewer, development entities being consolidated on our financial statements.

Homebuilding Inventory

The carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of lots
and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units.
Field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in
inventory costs. Interest costs are not capitalized into inventory. Upon settlement, the cost of
the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis. Cost of manufacturing materials is
determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Recoverability and impairment, if any, is primarily
evaluated by analyzing sales of comparable assets. We believe that our accounting policy is
designed to properly assess the carrying value of homebuilding inventory.

Contract Land Deposits

We purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may
be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract. The deposits are in the form of cash or
letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of
the finished lots. We maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that we believe
is sufficient to provide for losses in the existing


contract land deposit portfolio. The allowance
reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period, considering
market and economic conditions, sales absorption and profitability within specific communities and
terms of the various contracts. Although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land
deposits reflected on the December 31, 2005 balance sheet to be adequate, there can be no assurance
that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated
adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the
homebuilding industry.

Intangible Assets

Reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets (“excess reorganization value”),
goodwill, and indefinite life intangible assets are not subject to amortization under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”). Rather,
excess reorganization value, goodwill, and other intangible assets are subject to at least an
annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value based test. We continually evaluate
whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of excess
reorganization value, goodwill, and other intangible assets may not be recoverable. We completed
the annual assessment of impairment during the first quarter of 2005, and as of December 31, 2005,
we believe that excess reorganization value, goodwill, and other intangible assets were not
impaired. This conclusion is based on management’s judgment, considering such factors as our
history of operating success, our well-recognized brand names, and the significant positions held
in the markets in which we operate. However, changes in strategy or adverse changes in market
conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the
amount that the carrying value of excess reorganization value, goodwill, and/or other intangible
assets exceeds their fair value.

Warranty

/

Product Liability Accruals

Warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs
as a result of construction and product defects, product recalls and litigation incidental to our
business. Liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as
historical experience, the likely current cost of corrective action, manufacturers’ and
subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action, consultations with third
party experts such as engineers, and discussions with our General Counsel and other outside counsel
retained to handle specific product liability cases. Although we consider the warranty and product
liability accrual reflected on the December 31, 2005 balance sheet (see Note 10 to the consolidated
financial statements) to be adequate, there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be
adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor, the inability or
refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action,
unanticipated adverse legal settlements, or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to
estimate the warranty and product liability accrual.

Impact of Inflation, Changing Prices and Economic Conditions

See Risk Factors included in Item 1A herein.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and
interest rates. Our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial
instruments. Interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause
unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest rate-sensitive assets,
liabilities and commitments. Lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans
for home purchasers, while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential
borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans. We have no
market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes.

Our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its
lending activities. The mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans, which are either
sold through optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets. All
of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale
commitments. NVRM also sells substantially all of its mortgage servicing rights on a
servicing released basis.


Our homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets
through fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. The homebuilding segment’s primary debt is a
variable-rate working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured
borrowings up to $400,000, subject to certain borrowing base limitations. The Facility
expires in December 2010 and outstanding amounts bear interest at either (i) the prime rate
plus an Applicable Margin (as defined within the Facility) based on NVR’s credit rating and/or
debt to capital ratio or (ii) LIBOR plus applicable margin as defined above. The
weighted-average interest rates for the amounts outstanding under the Facility were 5.9% and
4.0% for 2005 and 2004, respectively.

NVRM generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage warehouse facility,
which had a borrowing limit of $225,000 at December 31, 2005. The available borrowing limit
was reduced to $175,000 on January 15, 2006. The mortgage warehouse facility is used to fund
its mortgage origination activities. The interest rate under the mortgage warehouse facility
is either: (i) LIBOR plus 1.125%, or (ii) 1.125% to the extent that NVRM provides compensating
balances. The weighted-average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the mortgage
warehouse facility was 4.4% during 2005.

The following table represents the contractual balances of our on-balance sheet financial
instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates, as well as the fair values of those
on-balance sheet financial instruments, at December 31, 2005. The expected maturity
categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and
does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing
indebtedness. Because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary
markets, we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will
mature in the first year. Consequently, outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase
facilities are also assumed to mature in the first year.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 31, 2005 were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules
and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified
in connection with the evaluation referred to above that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

NVR, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVR, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of NVR, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of NVR, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 23, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

NVR, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, included in Item 9A to the Company’s 2005 Form 10-K

,

that NVR, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)

.

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that NVR, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion,
NVR, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).


We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of NVR, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December
31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, and our report
dated February 23, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVR,
Inc. (“NVR” or the “Company”), its wholly owned subsidiaries, certain partially owned
entities, and variable interest entities of which the Company has determined that it is
the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less. The homebuilding and mortgage banking segments had
restricted cash of $5,135 and $1,738, respectively, at
December 31, 2005, and $2,123
and $965, respectively, at December 31, 2004, which includes certain customer deposits,
mortgagor tax escrows, insurance escrows, completion escrows and other amounts collected
at closing which relate to mortgage loans held for sale and to home sales.

Homebuilding Inventory

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of lots and
completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated
actual cost thereof. Field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct
overhead expenses are included in inventory costs. Interest costs are not capitalized
into inventory. Upon settlement, the cost of the units is expensed on a specific
identification basis. Cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a first-in,
first-out basis. Recoverability and impairment, if any, is primarily evaluated by
analyzing sales of comparable assets.

Contract Land Deposits

NVR purchases finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require
deposits that may be forfeited if NVR fails to perform under the contract. The deposits
are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a
percentage of the purchase price of the finished lots. NVR maintains an allowance for
losses on contract land deposits that it believes is sufficient to provide for losses in
the existing contract land deposit portfolio. The allowance reflects management’s
judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period, considering
market and economic conditions, sales absorption and profitability within specific
communities and terms of the various contracts.


NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the assets using
the straight-line method. Amortization of capital lease assets is included in depreciation
expense. Model home furniture and fixtures are generally depreciated over a two-year period,
office facilities and other equipment are depreciated over a period from three to ten years,
manufacturing facilities are depreciated over periods of from five to forty years and
property under capital leases is depreciated in a manner consistent with the Company’s
depreciation policy for owned assets.

Warranty/Product Liability Accruals

Warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for
estimated future expenses as a result of construction and product defects, product
recalls and litigation incidental to NVR’s business. Liability estimates are determined
based on management judgment considering such factors as historical experience, the
likely current cost of corrective action, manufacturers’ and subcontractors’
participation in sharing the cost of corrective action, consultations with third party
experts such as engineers, and discussions with our General Counsel and other outside
counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases.

Intangible Assets

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142

, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

, requires goodwill, indefinite life intangibles, and reorganization
value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets (“excess reorganization
value”), which is no longer subject to amortization, to be tested for impairment on an
annual basis. The Company completed the annual assessment of impairment and determined
that there is no impairment of either goodwill, indefinite life intangibles, or excess
reorganization value in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, Derivatives and Hedging Activities

NVR originates several different loan products to its customers to finance the
purchase of a home through its wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary. Those loan products include
previously non-traditional loan
products, such as interest-only loans, adjustable interest rate loans, negative amortization
loans and loans with relatively high loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios, with up to a one hundred
percent LTV. NVR sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market typically
within 30 days from origination. All of the loans that the Company originates, including
non-traditional loan products, are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the
ultimate investor. In addition, a substantial number of these nontraditional loans are
underwritten and funded at closing directly by the ultimate investor. Insofar as the Company
underwrites its originated loans to those standards, the Company bears no increased
concentration of credit risk from the issuance of these non-traditional products. The
Company employs a quality control department to ensure that its underwriting controls are
effectively operating, and further assesses the underwriting function as part of its
assessment of internal controls over financial reporting.

Mortgage loans held for sale are closed at fair value, and thereafter are carried at the
lower of cost or market.

In the normal course of business, NVR’s mortgage banking segment enters into contractual
commitments to extend credit to buyers of single-family homes with fixed expiration dates.
The commitments become effective when the borrowers “lock-in” a specified interest rate
within time frames established by NVR.


NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

All mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness
prior to the extension of the commitment. Market risk arises if interest rates move
adversely between the time of the “lock-in” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the
loan to a broker/dealer. To mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent
in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers, the Company enters into optional or
mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgage-backed securities
to broker/dealers. The forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the
sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments classified as derivatives. Both
the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to broker/dealers are
undesignated derivatives and, accordingly, are marked to market through earnings. NVR does
not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities. At December 31, 2005, there were
contractual
commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating approximately $140,000, and open
forward delivery sale contracts aggregating approximately $322,000.

Earnings per Share

share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. In addition, the 386,975 options
outstanding under the 2005 Stock Option Plan and 7,700 options outstanding under the 1998
Directors’ Long-Term Stock Option Plan are considered performance-based compensation, and
accordingly, have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share
because the EPS Target, as discussed in Note 9, has not been achieved as of December 31,
2005, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS 128,

Earnings Per Share

.

Revenues-Homebuilding Operations

NVR builds single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings,
which generally are produced on a pre-sold basis
for the ultimate customer. Revenues are recognized at the time units are completed
and title and risk of loss passes to the customer.

Mortgage Banking Fees

Mortgage banking fees include income earned by NVR’s mortgage banking
subsidiaries for originating mortgage loans, servicing mortgage loans held on an interim
basis, title fees, gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing
and other activities incidental to mortgage banking. Mortgage banking fees are generally
recognized after the loan has been sold to an unaffiliated, third party investor.


NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.

Financial Instruments

Except as otherwise noted here, NVR believes that insignificant differences
exist between the carrying value and the fair value of its financial instruments. The
estimated fair value of NVR’s 5% Senior Notes due 2010 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004
was $196,340 and $196,820, respectively. The estimated fair value is based on a quoted
market price. The carrying value was $200,000 at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Stock-Based Compensation

At December 31, 2005, the Company had eight active stock-based employee compensation
plans. As permitted under SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123

, NVR has elected to
continue to follow the intrinsic value method in accounting for its stock-based employee
compensation arrangements as defined by Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No.
25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related interpretations, including

Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions involving Stock Compensation

, an interpretation of

APB No. 25

. See the

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

section below for a discussion of the Company’s
anticipated adoption as of January 1, 2006 of the provisions of SFAS 123R.

During 2005, the Company issued 387,875 non-qualified stock options (“Options”)
under the 2005 Stock Option Plan (the “2005 Plan”) at an average exercise price of
$743.39 per share. The 2005 Plan was approved by the Company’s shareholders at the May
4, 2005 Annual Meeting and allows the Company to issue Options to employees, including
executive officers, to purchase up to 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The
exercise price of the Options granted was equal to the closing price of the Company’s
common stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant. Each Option was granted
for a term of ten years. No Option granted under the 2005 Plan will become exercisable
(other than in the case of a change in control as defined within the 2005 Plan) unless a
performance target based on growth in diluted earnings per share is met or exceeded (the
“EPS Target”). The EPS Target has been set at a level that reflects a growth rate in
diluted earnings per share of ten percent per year for four years, based on NVR’s 2004
diluted earnings per share of $66.42. The aggregate EPS Target is $339.00 per share, the
measurement of which is based on the sum of the actual diluted earnings per share results
for the four annual periods ending December 31, 2005 through 2008. If the EPS Target is
satisfied, Options granted under the 2005 Plan will become exercisable as to twenty-five
percent of the underlying shares on each of December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013,
(“Vesting Tranches”) respectively, or later, depending upon date of grant, based on
continued employment. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
granted 7,700 non-qualified stock options (“Director Options”) at an average exercise
price of $907.75 per share to the Company’s Directors under the


NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

1998 Directors’ Long Term
Stock Option Plan (the “1998 Directors’ Plan”). The Director Options are subject to the
aforementioned EPS Target.

Because the Options granted under the 2005 Plan and the 2005 Option grants under the
1998 Directors’ Plan are subject to a performance measure (the EPS Target), in accordance
with APB No. 25, these grants are considered variable awards. Compensation expense for
these variable award grants is measured based on the number of Options issued, using the
intrinsic value of the Options as of the end of the reporting period, and the cost is
recognized ratably over each Vesting Tranche separately. Based on the $702.00 per share
closing price of NVR common stock at December 31, 2005, there was no intrinsic value
related to the options granted under the 2005 Plan or the 1998 Directors’ Plan, and thus,
no compensation expense was recognized.

In accordance with SFAS No. 148, the following table discloses the effect on
net income and earnings per share as if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No.
123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, (“SFAS 123R”). SFAS 123R is a revision of SFAS
123 and supersedes APB No. 25. SFAS 123R requires that the cost resulting from all
share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and
establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment
arrangements. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission amended the
effective date for SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R is now effective as of the beginning of the
first interim or annual reporting period of a registrant’s first fiscal year beginning on
or after June 15, 2005. SFAS 123R applies to all awards granted, modified, repurchased
or cancelled after the effective date, and all outstanding
portions of awards granted prior to the effective date which are unvested as of the
effective date of the pronouncement.

Entities may adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R using either the modified prospective or
modified retrospective methods. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost is
recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for
which the requisite service has not yet been rendered, based on the grant-date fair value of
those awards calculated under SFAS 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosure. For
periods before the required effective date, the modified retrospective application may be
applied to either (a) all prior years for which SFAS 123 was effective or (b) only to prior
interim periods in the year of initial adoption, on a basis consistent with the pro forma
disclosures required for those periods by SFAS 123. SFAS 123R becomes effective for NVR
beginning in the first quarter of 2006. We plan to adopt SFAS 123R using the modified
prospective method. We expect our full year after tax expense in 2006 to be approximately
$36,000 related to the implementation of SFAS 123R, based on unvested stock options
outstanding at December 31, 2005.

2. Segment Information, Nature of Operations, and Certain Concentrations

NVR operates in two business segments: homebuilding and mortgage banking. The
homebuilding segment is one of the largest homebuilders in the United States and in the
Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD metropolitan areas, where NVR derived approximately 52% of
its 2005 homebuilding revenues. NVR’s homebuilding segment primarily constructs and sells
single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings under four tradenames: Ryan
Homes, NVHomes, Fox Ridge Homes, and Rymarc Homes. The Ryan Homes, Fox Ridge Homes, and Rymarc
Homes products are moderately priced and marketed primarily to first-time homeowners and
first-time move-up buyers. The Ryan Homes product is sold in twenty-one metropolitan areas
located in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Michigan and Kentucky. The Fox Ridge Homes product is
sold solely in the
Nashville, TN metropolitan area. The Rymarc Homes product is sold solely in the Columbia,
SC metropolitan area. The NVHomes product is sold in the Washington, D.C., Baltimore, MD,
Philadelphia, PA and Maryland Eastern Shore metropolitan areas, and is marketed primarily to
move-up and up-scale buyers.

The mortgage banking segment is a regional mortgage banking operation. Substantially all of
the mortgage banking segment’s loan closing activity is for NVR’s homebuilding customers. NVR’s
mortgage banking business generates revenues primarily from origination fees, gains on sales of
loans, title fees, and sales of servicing rights. A substantial portion of the Company’s mortgage
operations is conducted in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD metropolitan areas.

3. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

In December 2003, FASB issued Revised Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46R”),

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities

, which was effective for NVR as of March 31, 2004. FIN 46R requires the
primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity on its financial
statements. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a
majority of the variable interest entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s
expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual, or other financial
interests in the entity. Expected losses are the expected negative variability in the fair
value of an entity’s net assets, exclusive of its variable interests, and expected residual returns
are the expected positive variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets, exclusive of its
variable interests. As discussed below, NVR evaluates the provisions of FIN 46R as it relates to
NVR’s finished lot acquisition strategy.

NVR does not engage in the land development business. Instead, the Company typically
acquires finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed
price purchase agreements.


NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

The purchase agreements require deposits that may be forfeited if NVR
fails to perform under the agreement. The deposits required under the purchase agreements are in
the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts, and typically range up to 10% of the
aggregate purchase price of the finished lots. As of December 31, 2005, the Company controlled
approximately 105,000 lots with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately
$600,000 and $17,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, the Company controlled approximately
83,500 lots with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately $404,000 and
$13,000, respectively.

This lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with
direct land ownership and land development. NVR may, at its option, choose for any reason and at
any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of its intent not to
acquire the finished lots under contract. NVR’s sole legal obligation and economic loss for
failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant
to the liquidating damage provisions contained within the purchase agreements. In other words, if
NVR does not perform under a purchase agreement, NVR loses its deposit. NVR does not have any
financial or specific performance guarantees, or completion obligations, under these purchase
agreements, with the exception of three specific performance contracts pursuant to which the
company is committed to purchasing approximately 80 finished lots at an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $7,100. None of the creditors of any of the development entities with which NVR
enters fixed price purchase agreements have recourse to the general credit of NVR. Except as
described below, NVR also does not share in an
allocation of either the profit earned or loss incurred by any of these entities with which NVR
enters fixed price purchase agreements.

On a very limited basis, NVR also obtains finished lots using joint venture limited liability
corporations (“LLC’s”). All LLC’s are structured such that NVR is a non-controlling member and is
at risk only for the amount invested. NVR is not a borrower, guarantor or obligor on any of the
LLC’s debt. NVR enters into a standard fixed price purchase agreement to purchase lots from these
LLC’s.

At December 31, 2005, NVR had an aggregate investment in thirteen separate LLC’s totaling
approximately $15,000, which controlled approximately 1,000 lots. At December 31, 2004, NVR had an
aggregate investment in eleven separate LLC’s totaling approximately $12,800, which controlled
approximately 950 lots. NVR recognizes its share of the earnings of the LLC’s as a reduction of
the cost basis of the lots at the time that the lot and related home is settled with an external
customer. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, NVR reduced cost of sales by
approximately $287, $369 and $389, respectively, which represented NVR’s share of the earnings of
the LLC’s.

Forward contracts, such as the fixed price purchase agreements utilized by NVR to acquire
finished lot inventory, are deemed to be “variable interests” under FIN 46R. Therefore, the
development entities with which NVR enters fixed price purchase agreements, including the LLC’s,
are examined under FIN 46R for possible consolidation by NVR. NVR has developed a methodology to
determine whether it, or conversely, the owner(s) of the applicable development entity is the
primary beneficiary of a development entity. The methodology used to evaluate NVR’s primary
beneficiary status requires substantial management judgment and estimation. These judgments and
estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to
the development entity’s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in
the fair value of finished lots under contract. Although management believes that its accounting
policy is designed to properly assess NVR’s primary beneficiary status relative to its involvement
with the development entities from which NVR acquires finished lots, changes to the probabilities
and the cash flow possibilities used in
NVR’s evaluation could produce widely different conclusions regarding whether NVR is or is not a
development entity’s primary beneficiary.

The Company has evaluated all of its fixed price purchase agreements and LLC arrangements and
has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of thirty-five of those development entities with
which the


NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

agreements and arrangements are held. As a result, at December 31, 2005, NVR has
consolidated such development entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Where NVR
deemed itself to be the primary beneficiary of a development entity created after December 31, 2003
and the development entity refused to provide financial statements, NVR utilized estimation
techniques to perform the consolidation. The effect of the consolidation under FIN 46R at December
31, 2005 was the inclusion on the balance sheet of $275,306 as

Assets not owned, consolidated per
FIN 46R

with a corresponding inclusion of $215,284 as

Liabilities related to assets not owned,
consolidated per FIN 46R

, after elimination of intercompany items. Inclusive in these totals were
assets of approximately $39,000 and liabilities of approximately $34,000 estimated for ten
development entities created after December 31, 2003 that did not provide financial statements.

At December 31, 2004, under FIN 46R, the Company evaluated all of its fixed price purchase
agreements and LLC arrangements and determined that it was the primary beneficiary of nineteen of
those development entities with which the agreements and arrangements were held. As a result, at
December 31, 2004, NVR had consolidated such development entities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet. Of the nineteen development entities, three entities refused to provide financial
statements, and NVR utilized estimation techniques to perform the consolidation. The effect of the
consolidation under FIN 46R at December 31, 2004 was the inclusion on the balance sheet of $89,924
as

Assets not owned, consolidated per FIN 46R

with a corresponding inclusion of $63,568 as

Liabilities related to assets not owned, consolidated per FIN 46R

, after elimination of
intercompany items. Inclusive in these totals were assets of approximately $16,000 and liabilities
of approximately $12,500 for three development entities created after December 31, 2003 that did
not provide financial statements.

NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

Under FIN 46R, an enterprise with an interest in a variable interest entity or potential
variable interest entity created before December 31, 2003, is not required to apply FIN 46R to that
entity if the enterprise, after making an “exhaustive effort”, is unable to obtain the information
necessary to perform the accounting required to consolidate the variable interest entity for which
it is determined to be the primary beneficiary. At December 31, 2005 NVR has been unable to obtain
the information necessary to perform the accounting required to consolidate thirteen separate
development entities created before December 31, 2003 for which NVR determined it was the primary
beneficiary. NVR has made, or has committed to make, aggregate deposits, totaling $15,462 to these
thirteen separate development entities, with a total aggregate purchase price for the finished lots
of approximately $121,000. The aggregate deposit made or committed to being made is NVR’s maximum
exposure to loss. As noted above, because NVR does not have any contractual or ownership interests
in the development entities with which it contracts to buy finished lots (other than the limited
use of the LLC’s as discussed above), NVR does not have the ability to compel these development
entities to provide financial or other data. Because NVR has no ownership rights in any of these
thirteen development entities, the consolidation of such entities has no impact on NVR’s net income
or earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Aggregate activity
with respect to the thirteen development entities is included in the following table:

4. Related Party Transactions

During 2005, 2004, and 2003, NVR purchased, at market prices, developed lots from Elm
Street Development, a company that is controlled by a member of the NVR Board of Directors
(the “Board”). These transactions were approved by a majority of the independent members of
the Board. Purchases from Elm Street Development totaled approximately $29,000, $8,200 and
$15,000 during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NVR expects to purchase the majority of the
remaining lots under contract at December 31, 2005 over the next 36 months for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $104,000.

During 2005, NVR entered into various marketing and promotional arrangements with certain
entities controlled by or affiliated with the Washington Redskins National Football League
franchise (the “Redskins”). NVR’s Chairman is a minority owner of the Redskins. These
arrangements were approved by a majority of the independent members of the Board. In total,
NVR incurred or committed to incur $960 under these marketing and promotional arrangements.

In 2003, NVR entered into a forward lot purchase agreement with Comstock Blooms Mill II,
LLC, an entity controlled 100% by an entity in which the Company’s Chairman’s son-in-law was a
principal at the time of the transaction. This purchase agreement was approved by a majority
of the independent members of the Board. Under this agreement, NVR purchased, at market
prices, finished lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4,000 and $2,000
during 2004 and 2003, respectively. No additional lots remain to be purchased under this
agreement.

NVR periodically leases, at market rates, an airplane owned by the Company’s
Chairman for Company travel when the use of the airplane lends itself to business travel
efficiencies. NVR’s independent members of the Board annually review these expenditures.
During 2005, NVR paid approximately $323 for use of the airplane.

(a)

The Company, as borrower, has available an unsecured working capital revolving credit
facility (the “Facility”). During 2005, the Company increased the available borrowings under
the Facility to $400,000 from $150,000 by refinancing the Company’s previous working capital
agreement. The current Facility now provides for borrowings of up to $400,000 subject to
certain borrowing base limitations. The Facility is generally available to fund working
capital needs of NVR’s homebuilding segment. Up to $150,000 of the Facility is currently
available for issuance in the form of letters of credit, of which $26,412 and $21,794 were
outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Facility expires in December
2010 and outstanding amounts bear interest at either (i) the prime rate plus an Applicable
Margin (as defined within the Facility) based on NVR’s credit rating and/or debt to capital
ratio or (ii) the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) plus applicable margin as defined
above. The weighted-average interest rate for the amounts outstanding under the Facility was
5.9% during 2005. The weighted-average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the
previous working capital agreement was 4% during 2004. At December 31, 2005, there were no
borrowing base limitations reducing the amount
available to the Company for borrowings.

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

The Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants
include among others, certain limitations on transactions involving the creation of
guarantees, sale of assets, acquisitions, mergers, investments and land purchases. Additional
covenants include (i) a minimum adjusted consolidated tangible net worth requirement, (ii) a
maximum leverage ratio requirement, and (iii) an interest coverage ratio requirement. These
covenants restrict the amount in which the Company would be able to pay in dividends each
year. The Company is also subject to borrowing base restrictions if the Company’s senior debt
rating falls below investment grade. At December 31, 2005 NVR was in compliance with all
covenants under the Facility.

(b) The capital lease obligations have fixed interest rates ranging from 5.1% to 13.0% and are
collateralized by land, buildings and equipment with a net book value of approximately $1,655
and $4,322 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The following schedule provides future minimum lease payments under all capital leases
together with the present value as of December 31, 2005:

(c)   On January 20, 1998, the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the issuance of up to $400,000 of the Company’s debt
securities (the “1998 Shelf Registration”). The 1998 Shelf Registration statement was
declared effective on February 27, 1998 and provides that securities may be offered from time
to time in one or more series, and in the form of senior or subordinated debt. As of December
31, 2005, NVR had $55,000 available for issuance under the 1998 Shelf Registration.

On June 17, 2003, NVR completed an offering, at par, for $200,000 of 5% Senior Notes due
2010 (the “Notes”) under the 1998 Shelf Registration. The offering of the Notes resulted in
aggregate net proceeds of approximately $199,400, after deducting offering expenses. The Notes
mature on June 15, 2010 and bear interest at 5%, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and
December 15, commencing on December 15, 2003. The Notes are general unsecured obligations and
rank equally in right of payment with all of NVR’s existing and future unsecured senior
indebtedness and indebtedness under NVR’s existing credit facility. The Notes are senior in
right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness that NVR may incur. The Company may
redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
notice at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes to be redeemed, or (b) the discounted present value of the remaining scheduled payments of
the Notes to be redeemed, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest.

On July 14, 2003, NVR used approximately $120,700 of the proceeds received from the sale
of the Notes to redeem all of the $115,000 outstanding 8% Senior Notes due 2005 at a price of
104% of the principal amount outstanding, including the payment of accrued interest. The
redemption resulted in a charge to pre-tax homebuilding income of $8,503.


NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

The indenture governing the Notes has, among other items, limitations on the incurrence
of
secured debt, restrictions on sale and leaseback transactions, and conditions related to
mergers and/or the sale of assets.

On May 27, 2004, NVR filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to register up to
$1,000,000 for future offer and sale of debt securities, common shares, preferred shares,
depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants (the “2004 Shelf Registration”).
The SEC declared the 2004 Shelf Registration effective on June 15, 2004. NVR expects to use
the proceeds received from future offerings issued under the 2004 Shelf Registration for
general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2005, no amounts have been issued under the
2004 Shelf Registration. This discussion of the 2004 Shelf Registration does not constitute
an offer of any securities for sale.

(d) The mortgage warehouse facility (“Mortgage Warehouse Revolving Credit”) of NVR Mortgage
Finance, Inc. (“NVRM”) currently has a borrowing limit of $225,000 at December 31, 2005. This
limit was temporarily increased from $175,000 on December 15, 2005 to accommodate heavy
year-end closing volume. The borrowing limit reverted back to $175,000 on January 15, 2006.
The Revolving Credit Agreement is used to fund its mortgage origination activities. The
interest rate under the Mortgage Warehouse Revolving Credit agreement is either: (i) LIBOR
plus 1.125%, or (ii) 1.125% to the extent that NVRM provides compensating balances. The
weighted-average interest rates for amounts outstanding under the Mortgage Warehouse Revolving
Credit facility were 4.4% and 1.9% during 2005 and 2004, respectively. The average interest
rate for amounts outstanding at December 31, 2005 was 5.5%. Mortgage loans and gestation
mortgage-backed securities collateralize the Mortgage Warehouse Revolving Credit borrowings.
The Mortgage Warehouse Revolving Credit facility is annually renewable and currently expires
in August 2006.

The Mortgage Warehouse Revolving Credit agreement includes, among other items,
covenants restricting NVRM from incurring additional borrowings and making intercompany dividends and tax
payments. In addition, NVRM is required to maintain a minimum net worth of $14,000. As of
December 31, 2005, borrowing base limitations reduced the amount available to NVRM for
borrowings to approximately $184,500. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Mortgage Warehouse Revolving Credit agreement at December 31, 2005.

(e) NVRM currently has available an aggregate of $50,000 of borrowing capacity in an
uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement. Amounts outstanding thereunder accrue
interest at various rates tied to the LIBOR rate and are collateralized by gestation
mortgage-backed securities and whole loans. The uncommitted facility generally requires NVRM
to, among other items, maintain a minimum net worth and limit its level of liabilities in
relation to its net worth. There were no borrowings under the uncommitted facility during
2005 and 2004.

approximately 19,490,000 shares of NVR common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately
$2,625,300 since December 31, 1993. The Company repurchased 1,269,050; 674,694 and 1,103,968

NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

Deferred tax assets arise principally as a result of various accruals required for
financial reporting purposes and deferred compensation, which are not currently deductible for
tax return purposes.

Management believes that the Company will have sufficient available carry-backs and
future taxable income to make it more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be
realized. Federal taxable income was approximately $877,753 and $605,987 for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004.

A reconciliation of income tax expense in the accompanying statements of income to the

taxes is as follows:

The Company’s effective tax rate in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 39.0%, 40.0% and 39.7%,
respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2005 is primarily due to the favorable tax
impact of the new Internal Revenue Code Section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction
established by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

9. Profit Sharing and Incentive Plans

Profit Sharing Plans

—NVR has a trustee-administered, profit sharing retirement plan (the
“Profit Sharing Plan”) and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) covering substantially
all employees. The Profit Sharing Plan and the ESOP provide for annual discretionary
contributions in amounts as determined by the NVR Board of Directors (the “Board”). The
combined plan contribution for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $15,370,
$12,488 and $10,787, respectively. The ESOP purchased approximately 18,000 and 26,000 shares
of NVR common stock in the open market for the 2005 and 2004 plan year contributions,
respectively, using cash contributions provided by the Company. As of December 31, 2005, all
shares held by the ESOP have been allocated to participants’ accounts other than the 2005 plan
year contribution, which had been committed to be released to participants’ accounts, and was
fully allocated to participants in February 2006.

High Performance Compensation Plans—

During 2004 and 2003, NVR recognized $4,227 and
$8,948, respectively, of compensation costs related to the High Performance Plan (the “HP
Plan”), a long-term cash compensation program for executive officers and other key personnel.
The High Performance Plan was fully vested in 2004 and therefore, NVR did not recognize
compensation costs related to the High Performance Plan during 2005.

Management Stock-Based Incentive Plans

—Management long-term incentive plans provide
several types of equity incentives to NVR’s executives and managers. The equity incentives
take the form of stock options and performance share awards as described below. Stock options
issued under the management long-term incentive plans are issued with an exercise price equal
to the market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant.

Under the Management Incentive Plan approved by the shareholders in 1994, participants
received options to purchase a total of 1,117,949 NVR shares (the “1993 NVR Share Options”).


NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

The 1993 NVR Share Options issued under the Management Incentive Plan were fully vested as of
December 31, 1996, and expire 10 years after the dates upon which they were granted.

Under the 1994 Management Incentive Plan (the “1994 Incentive Plan”), executive officers
and other employees of the Company were eligible to receive stock options (the “1994 NVR Share
Options”)
and performance shares (the “1994 Performance Shares”). There were 48,195 1994 NVR Share
Options and 1,124,929 1994 Performance Shares authorized for grant under the 1994 Incentive
Plan. The 1994 NVR Share Options expire 10 years after the dates upon which they were
granted, and were fully vested as of December 31, 1999. All 1,124,929 1994 Performance Shares
had been granted to employees and were vested as of December 31, 1999.

During 1996, the Company’s shareholders approved the Board of Directors’ adoption of the
Management Long-Term Stock Option Plan (the “1996 Option Plan”). There are 2,000,000
non-qualified stock options (“Options”) authorized under the Management Long Term Stock Option
Plan. The Options expire 10 years after the dates upon which they were granted, and vest
annually in one-third increments beginning on December 31, 2000, or later depending on the
date of grant, with vesting contingent upon continued employment.

During 1999, the Company’s shareholders approved the Board of Directors’ adoption of the
1998 Management Long-Term Stock Option Plan (the “1998 Option Plan”). There are 1,000,000
non-qualified stock options (“Options”) authorized under the 1998 Option Plan. The Options
expire 10 years after the dates upon which they were granted, and vest annually in one-third
increments beginning on December 31, 2003, or later depending on the date of grant, with
vesting contingent upon continued employment.

During 2000, the Board approved the 2000 Broadly-Based Stock Option Plan (The “2000
Plan”). The 2000 Plan was not approved by the Company’s shareholders. There are 2,000,000
non-qualified stock options (“Options”) authorized under the 2000 Plan. Grants under the 2000
Plan are available to both employees and members of the Board. The distribution of Options to
key employees and members of the board, in aggregate, are limited to 50% or less of the total
options authorized under the 2000 Plan. Options granted under the 2000 Plan will expire 10
years from the date of grant, and generally vest annually in 25% increments beginning on
December 31, 2006, or later depending on the date of grant, with vesting contingent upon
continued employment.

During 2005, the Company’s shareholders approved the Board of Directors’ adoption of the
2005 Stock Option Plan (The “2005 Plan”). There are 500,000 non-qualified stock options
(“Options”) authorized under the 2005 Plan. All Options under the Plan will be granted at the
fair market value underlying the Shares at the date of grant and are subject to two vesting
conditions. The first vesting condition requires that the Company satisfy a performance
target based on growth in earnings per share (“EPS Target”) as of December 31, 2008. The EPS
Target has been set at a level that reflects a growth rate in diluted earnings per share of
ten percent per year for four years, based on NVR’s 2004 diluted earnings per share of $66.42.
The aggregate EPS Target is $339.00 per share, the measurement of which is based on the sum
of the actual diluted earnings per share results for the four annual periods ending December
31, 2005 through 2008. All Options granted will be cancelled if the EPS Target is not met.
Secondly, Options will vest in 25% annual increments beginning December 31, 2010, or later,
depending on the date of grant and based on continued employment.

Director Incentive Plans

During 1996, the Company’s shareholders approved the Board of Directors’ adoption of the
Directors’ Long Term Stock Option Plan (the “1996 Directors’ Plan”). Under this plan, there
were 192,000 options to purchase shares of common stock authorized and granted to the
Company’s outside directors. There are no additional options available for grant under this
plan. The option exercise price for the options granted was $10.25 per share, which was equal
to the fair market value of the Company’s Shares on the date of grant. The Options were
granted for a 10-year period and were fully vested as of December 31, 2001. The weighted
average remaining contractual life is 0.4 years.

During 1999, the Company’s shareholders approved the Board of Directors’ adoption of the
1998 Directors’ Long Term Stock Option Plan (the “1998 Directors’ Plan”). There were 150,000
options to purchase shares of common stock authorized for grant to the Company’s outside
directors under the 1998 Directors’ Plan. A total of 87,500 options were granted at an
exercise price of $49.06, and 34,000 options were granted at $369.75. All options were granted
at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Shares on the date of
grant. The Options were granted for a 10-year period and vest annually in twenty-five percent
(25%) increments beginning on either December 31, 2002 or December 31, 2006, as determined by
the date of grant. The weighted average remaining contractual life in years for the options
granted at $49.06 and $369.75 is 3.4 and 6.3, respectively. In addition, during the third
quarter of 2005, the Company granted 7,700 non-qualified stock options (“Director Options”) at
an average exercise price of $907.75 per share to the Company’s Directors under the 1998
Directors’ Plan. The weighted average remaining contractual life in years for these options is
9.6 years. These Options are subject to the aforementioned EPS Target. If the EPS Target is
satisfied, the 7,700 Options granted under the 1998 Directors’ Plan will become exercisable as
to twenty-five percent of the underlying shares on each of December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012 and
2013, respectively, based on continued service by the director.

The members of Board of Directors also participate in the 2000 Broadly-Based Stock Option
Plan, as described previously herein.

NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

To minimize the non-deductibility of executive compensation expense due to the
limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and still maintain the ability to
competitively compensate the Company’s executive officers, the Company established a deferred
compensation plan (“Deferred Comp Plan”). The specific purpose of the Deferred Comp Plan was
to establish a vehicle whereby the executive officers could defer the receipt of compensation
that otherwise would be nondeductible for tax purposes by the Company into a period where the
Company would realize a tax deduction for the amounts paid. The Deferred Comp Plan is also
available to other members of the Company’s management group. Amounts deferred into the
Deferred Comp Plan are invested in NVR common stock, held in a rabbi trust account, and are
paid out in a fixed number of shares upon expiration of the deferral period.

The rabbi trust account held 547,697 and 549,029 shares of NVR common stock as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During 2005, 1,332 shares of NVR common stock were
issued from the rabbi trust related to deferred compensation for which the deferral period
ended. There were no shares of NVR common stock contributed to the rabbi trust in 2005.
Shares held by the Deferred Comp Plan are treated as outstanding shares in the Company’s
earnings per share calculation for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

10. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

NVR is committed under multiple non-cancelable operating leases involving office
space, model homes, manufacturing facilities, automobiles and equipment. Future minimum
lease payments under these operating leases as of December 31, 2005 are as follows:

Years ended December 31,

19,133


15,795


12,935


8,802

Thereafter

35,976

$

120,230

Total rent expense incurred under operating leases was approximately $39,033,
$30,223 and $25,790 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

NVR is not in the land development business. The Company purchases finished lots
under fixed price purchase agreements, which require deposits, which may be forfeited if
the Company fails to perform under the contract. The deposits are in the form of cash or
letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage, typically ranging up to
10%, of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots. This lot acquisition strategy
reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land
development. The Company generally seeks to maintain control over a supply of lots
believed to be suitable to meet its sales objectives for the next 24 to 36 months.
At December 31, 2005, assuming that contractual development milestones are met, NVR is
committed to placing additional forfeitable deposits with land developers under existing
lot option contracts of approximately $214,000. In addition, at December 31, 2005, the
Company was committed to purchasing approximately 80 finished lots at an aggregate purchase
price of $7,100 under three specific performance contracts.

During the ordinary course of operating the mortgage banking and homebuilding
businesses, NVR is required to enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local
municipalities, government agencies, or land developers to collateralize its obligations
under various contracts.


NVR, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

NVR had approximately $33,325 (including $26,412 for letters of credit as described in Note 6(a)
herein) of contingent obligations under such agreements as of December 31, 2005. NVR
believes it will fulfill its obligations under the related contracts and does not anticipate
any losses under these bonds or letters of credit.

The Company establishes warranty and product liability reserves to provide for estimated
future expenses as a result of construction and product defects, product recalls and litigation
incidental to NVR’s homebuilding business. Liability estimates are determined based on
management’s judgment considering such factors as historical experience, the likely current cost of
corrective action, manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of
corrective action, consultations with third party experts such as engineers, and discussions with
our General Counsel and other outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases.
The following table reflects the changes in the Company’s warranty reserve for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004:

NVR and its subsidiaries are also involved in litigation arising from the normal
course of business. In the opinion of management, and based on advice of legal counsel,
this litigation is not expected to have any material adverse effect on the financial
position or results of operations of NVR.

In April 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified NVR
that the Company was allegedly in violation of Section 308(a) of the Clean Water Act (the
“Act”) at a construction site in Pennsylvania relative to storm water management during the
homebuilding construction process. The notice informed NVR that the Company might be subject
to administrative fines of up to $157 for the alleged violations. Subsequently, in September
2005, NVR received a request from the EPA pursuant to the Act for information about storm
water discharge practices utilized in connection with other recent homebuilding projects
undertaken by the Company. NVR is working with the EPA to provide the requested information
and to review NVR’s compliance with the Act. It is not known at this time whether the EPA
will seek to take legal action or impose penalties in connection with the alleged violation at
the construction site in Pennsylvania.

11. Acquisition

During January 2005, NVR acquired substantially all of the assets of Marc Homebuilders,
Inc. (“Marc”), a homebuilder in Columbia, South Carolina for $7,600 in cash. Marc settled
approximately 230 homes during 2004 under the Rymarc trade name, generating approximately
$27,000 in revenue. The
Company has recorded in the consolidated balance sheet certain indefinite and definite life
intangible assets in an amount equal to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value
of the net assets acquired. As of December 31, 2005, certain post-closing performance
benchmarks were met and an additional payment of $1,500 is due to Marc and was recorded as an
increase to goodwill at December 31, 2005.

12. Quarterly Results (unaudited)
