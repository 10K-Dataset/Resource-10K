ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Company
    Overview

We are a leading provider of services in the domestic
    non-hazardous solid waste industry. We provide non-hazardous
    solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial,
    municipal and residential customers through 140 collection
    companies in 21 states. We also own or operate 92 transfer
    stations, 59 solid waste landfills and 32 recycling
    facilities.

As of December 31, 2005, our operations were organized into
    five regions whose boundaries may change from time to time:
    Eastern, Central, Southern, Southwestern and Western. Each
    region is organized into several operating areas and each area
    contains multiple operating locations. Each of our regions and
    substantially all our areas provide collection, transfer,
    recycling and disposal services. We believe that this
    organizational structure facilitates the integration of our
    operations within each region, which is a critical component of
    our operating strategy. See Note 10 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
    operating segments.

We had revenue of $2,863.9 million and
    $2,708.1 million and operating income of
    $477.2 million and $452.3 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
    $155.8 million, or 5.8%, increase in revenue and the
    $24.9 million, or 5.5%, increase in operating income from
    2004 to 2005 is primarily attributable to the successful
    execution of our operating and growth strategies described below.

Our presence in high growth markets throughout the Sunbelt,
    including California, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina,
    South Carolina and Texas, and in other domestic markets that
    have experienced higher than average population growth during
    the past several years, supports our internal growth strategy.
    We believe that our presence in these markets positions our
    company to experience growth at rates that are generally higher
    than the industry’s overall growth rate.

We continue to focus on enhancing stockholder value by
    implementing our financial, operating and growth strategies as
    described below.

We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1996.

Industry
    Overview

Based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications,
    we believe that the United States non-hazardous solid waste
    services industry generates annual revenue of approximately
    $46.5 billion, of which approximately 48% is generated by
    publicly-owned waste companies, 23% is generated by
    privately-held waste companies, and 29% is generated by
    municipal and other local governmental authorities. Three
    companies generate the substantial majority of the
    publicly-owned companies’ total revenue. However, according
    to industry data, the domestic non-hazardous waste industry
    remains highly fragmented as privately-held companies and
    municipal and other local governmental authorities generate
    approximately 52% of total industry revenue. In general, growth
    in the solid waste industry is linked to growth in the overall
    economy, including the level of new household and business
    formation.

The solid waste industry experienced a period of rapid
    consolidation in the late 1990’s. During that time we were
    able to grow significantly through acquisitions. However,
    acquisitions in the industry have slowed considerably since late
    1999. Despite this, we believe that the opportunity to grow
    through acquisitions still exists, albeit at a slower pace than
    experienced in previous years, as a result of the following
    factors:

Subtitle D Regulation.

Subtitle D of the
    Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as currently in
    effect, and similar state regulations have significantly
    increased the amount of capital, technical expertise, operating
    costs and financial assurance obligations required to own and
    operate a landfill and other solid waste facilities. Many of the
    smaller participants in our industry have found these costs
    difficult, if not impossible, to bear. Large publicly-owned
    companies, like our company, have greater access to, and a lower
    cost of, the capital necessary to finance such increased capital
    expenditures and costs relative to many of the privately-owned
    companies in the industry. Additionally, the required permits
    for landfill development, expansion or


construction have become more difficult, time-consuming and
    costly to acquire. Consequently, many smaller, independent
    operators have decided to either close their operations or sell
    them to larger operators that have greater access to capital.

Integration of Solid Waste Businesses.

By
    being able to control the waste stream in a market through the
    collection, transfer and disposal process, integrated solid
    waste companies gain a further competitive advantage over
    non-integrated operators. The ability of the integrated
    companies to both collect and dispose of solid waste, coupled
    with access to significant capital resources necessary for
    acquisitions, has created an environment in which large
    publicly-owned, integrated companies can operate more cost
    effectively and competitively than non-integrated operators.

Municipal Privatization.

The trend toward
    consolidation in the solid waste services industry is further
    supported by the increasing tendency of a number of
    municipalities to privatize their waste disposal operations.
    Privatization of municipal waste operations is often an
    attractive alternative to funding the changes required by
    Subtitle D.

These developments, as well as the fact that there are a limited
    number of viable exit strategies for many of the owners and
    principals of numerous privately-held companies in the industry,
    have contributed to the overall consolidation trend in the solid
    waste industry.

Financial
    Strategy

A key component of our financial strategy is our ability to
    generate free cash flow. Our definition of free cash flow, which
    is not a measure determined in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, is cash provided by operating
    activities less purchases of property and equipment plus
    proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in
    our consolidated statements of cash flows. We believe that free
    cash flow is a driver of shareholder value and provides useful
    information regarding the recurring cash provided by our
    operating activities after expenditures for property and
    equipment. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our
    financial strategy. Consequently, we have developed incentive
    programs and we conduct monthly field operating reviews that
    help focus our entire company on the importance of increasing
    free cash flow.

The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations.
    Free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for
    discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain
    expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such
    as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our
    definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly
    titled measures presented by other companies.

We manage our free cash flow primarily by ensuring that capital
    expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light
    of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely
    managing our working capital, which consists primarily of
    accounts receivable and accounts payable.

We have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize
    stockholder value as well as our return on investment. This
    includes the following:

•

Customer Service.

We will continue to
    reinvest in our existing fleet of vehicles, equipment, landfills
    and facilities to ensure a high level of service to our
    customers.

•

Internal Growth.

Growth through
    increases in our customer base and services provided is the most
    capital efficient means for us to build our business. This
    includes not only expanding landfill and transfer capacity and
    investing in trucks and containers, but also includes investing
    in information tools and training needed to ensure high
    productivity and quality service throughout all functional areas
    of our business.

•

Strategic Acquisitions.

We have and
    will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that augment our
    existing business platform.

•

Share Repurchases.

If we are unable to
    identify opportunities that satisfy our growth strategy, we
    intend to continue to use our free cash flow to repurchase
    shares of our common stock at prices that provide value to our
    stockholders. As of December 31, 2005, we had repurchased a
    total of 51.5 million shares, or approximately 29% of our
    common stock outstanding at the commencement of our share
    repurchase


program in 2000, for $1,308.8 million. From 2000 through
    2005, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of
    $1,525.0 million of the company’s common stock, of
    which $216.2 million remained available at
    December 31, 2005. In January 2006, our board of directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to an additional
    $275.0 million of our common stock. We believe that our
    share repurchase program will continue to enhance stockholder
    value.

•

Dividends.

In July 2003, our board of
    directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $.06 per
    share. The dividend was increased to $.12 per share in the
    third quarter of 2004 and to $.14 per share in the third
    quarter of 2005. We may consider increasing our quarterly cash
    dividend if we believe it will enhance stockholder value.

•

Minimize Borrowings.

To the extent that
    the opportunities to enhance stockholder value mentioned above
    are not available, we also intend to continue to use our free
    cash flow to minimize our borrowings.

Another key component of our financial strategy includes
    maintaining an investment grade rating on our senior debt. This
    has allowed us to secure favorable, long-term, fixed-rate
    financing that reduces our exposure to changing interest rates.
    This has also allowed us, and will continue to allow us, to
    readily access capital markets.

For certain risks related to our financial strategy, see
    “Risk Factors.”

Operating
    Strategy

We seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to
    increase operating margins and enhance stockholder value. Our
    operating strategy to accomplish this goal is to:

•

utilize the extensive industry knowledge and experience of our
    executive management,

•

utilize a decentralized management structure in overseeing

day-to-day

operations,

•

integrate waste operations,

•

improve operating margins through economies of scale, cost
    efficiencies and asset utilization,

•

achieve high levels of customer satisfaction, and

•

utilize systems to improve consistency in financial and
    operational performance.

For certain risks related to our operating strategy, see
    “Risk Factors.”

•

Experienced Executive Management
    Team.

We believe that we have one of the most
    experienced executive management teams in the solid waste
    industry.

James E. O’Connor, who has served as our Chief Executive
    Officer since December 1998, also became our Chairman in January
    2003. He worked at Waste Management, Inc. from 1972 to 1978 and
    from 1982 to 1998. During that time, he served in various
    management positions, including Senior Vice President in 1997
    and 1998, and Area President of Waste Management of Florida,
    Inc. from 1992 to 1997. Mr. O’Connor has over
    31 years of experience in the solid waste industry.

Michael J. Cordesman, who has served as our Chief Operating
    Officer since March 2002 and also as our President since
    February 2003, has over 25 years of experience in the solid
    waste industry. He joined us in June 2001 as our Eastern Region
    Vice President. From 1999 to 2001, Mr. Cordesman served as
    Vice President of the Central Region for Superior Services Inc.
    From 1980 to 1999, he served in various positions with Waste
    Management, including Vice President of the Mid-Atlantic Region
    from 1992 to 1999.

The other corporate officers with responsibility for our
    operations have an average of over 24 years of management
    experience in the solid waste industry. Our five regional vice
    presidents and our 21 area presidents have an average of
    24 years of experience in the industry.

In addition, Harris W. Hudson, who has served as our Vice
    Chairman since our initial public offering, has over
    41 years of experience in the solid waste industry,
    including 11 years with Waste Management and 19 years
    with private waste collection companies.


•

Decentralized Management Structure.

We
    maintain a relatively small corporate headquarters staff,
    relying on a decentralized management structure to minimize
    administrative overhead costs and to manage our

day-to-day

operations more efficiently. Our local management has extensive
    industry experience in growing, operating and managing solid
    waste companies and has substantial experience in their local
    geographic markets. In early 2001, we added a sales, maintenance
    and operations manager to each of our regional management teams,
    which previously consisted of a regional vice president and a
    regional controller. We believe that strengthening our regional
    management teams allows us to more effectively and efficiently
    drive our company’s initiatives and helps ensure
    consistency throughout our organization. Our regional management
    teams and our area presidents have extensive authority,
    responsibility and autonomy for operations within their
    respective geographic markets. Compensation for our area
    management teams is primarily based on the improvement in
    operating income produced and the free cash flow and return on
    invested capital generated in each manager’s geographic
    area of responsibility. In addition, through long-term incentive
    programs, including stock options, we believe we have one of the
    lowest turnover levels in the industry for our local management
    teams. As a result of retaining experienced managers with
    extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local
    communities, we are proactive in anticipating our
    customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets.
    We also seek to implement the best practices of our various
    regions and areas throughout our operations to improve operating
    margins.

•

Integrated Operations.

We seek to
    achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste
    streams from the point of collection through disposal. We expect
    that our fully integrated markets generally will have a lower
    cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our
    non-integrated markets. Through acquisitions and other market
    development activities, we create market-specific, integrated
    operations typically consisting of one or more collection
    companies, transfer stations and landfills. We consider
    acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with
    significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels
    of waste volume. We also seek to acquire solid waste collection
    companies in markets in which we own or operate landfills. In
    addition, we generate internal growth in our disposal operations
    by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills
    from time to time in markets in which we have significant
    collection operations or in markets that we determine lack
    sufficient disposal capacity. During the three months ended
    December 31, 2005, approximately 57% of the total volume of
    waste that we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or
    operate. In a number of our larger markets, we and our
    competitors are required to take waste to government-controlled
    disposal facilities. This provides us with an opportunity to
    effectively compete in these markets without investing in
    landfill capacity. Because we do not have landfill facilities or
    government-controlled disposal facilities for all markets in
    which we provide collection services, we believe that through
    landfill and transfer station acquisitions and development we
    have the opportunity to increase our waste internalization rate
    and further integrate our operations. By further integrating
    operations in existing markets through acquisitions and
    development of landfills and transfer stations, we may be able
    to reduce our disposal costs.

•

Economies of Scale, Cost Efficiencies and Asset
    Utilization.

To improve operating margins,
    our management focuses on achieving economies of scale and cost
    efficiencies. The consolidation of acquired businesses into
    existing operations reduces costs by decreasing capital and
    expenses used for routing, personnel, equipment and vehicle
    maintenance, inventories and back-office administration.
    Generally, we consolidate our acquired administrative centers to
    reduce our general and administrative costs. Our goal is to
    maintain our selling, general and administrative costs in the
    range of 10% of revenue, which we feel is appropriate given our
    existing business platform. In addition, our size allows our
    company to negotiate volume discounts for certain purchases,
    including waste disposal rates at landfills operated by third
    parties. Furthermore, we have taken steps to increase
    utilization of our assets. For example, to reduce the number of
    collection vehicles and maximize the efficiency of our fleet, we
    have instituted a grid productivity program which allows us to
    benchmark the performance of all of our drivers. In our larger
    markets, we also use a route optimization program to minimize
    drive times and improve operating density. By using assets more
    efficiently, operating expenses can be reduced.


•

High Levels of Customer
    Satisfaction.

Our goal of maintaining high
    levels of customer satisfaction complements our operating
    strategy. Our personalized sales process is oriented towards
    maintaining relationships and ensuring that service is being
    properly provided.

•

Utilize Systems to Improve Consistency in Financial and
    Operational Performance.

We continue to focus
    on systems and training initiatives that complement our
    operating strategy. These initiatives include contact
    management, billing, productivity, maintenance and general
    ledger systems. These systems provide us with detailed
    information, prepared in a consistent manner that will allow us
    to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business.

For certain risks related to our operating strategy, see
    “Risk Factors.”

Growth
    Strategy

Our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue, gaining
    market share and enhancing stockholder value through internal
    growth and acquisitions. For certain risks related to our growth
    strategy, see “Risk Factors.”

•

Internal Growth.

Our internal growth
    strategy focuses on retaining existing customers and obtaining
    commercial, municipal and industrial customers through our
    well-managed sales and marketing activities.

Pricing Activities.

We seek to secure price
    increases necessary to offset increased costs. During the fourth
    quarter of 2003, we implemented a broad-based pricing initiative
    across all lines of our business. During 2004 and 2005 we
    secured further broad-based price increases to offset various
    escalating capital and operating costs, including fuel. Price
    increases continue to be a major component of our overall
    operating strategy.

Long-Term Contracts.

We seek to obtain
    long-term contracts for collecting solid waste in high-growth
    markets. These include exclusive franchise agreements with
    municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts.
    By obtaining such long-term agreements, we have the opportunity
    to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the
    underlying population growth in these markets. For example, we
    have secured exclusive, long-term franchise agreements in
    high-growth markets such as Los Angeles, Orange and Contra Costa
    Counties in California, Las Vegas, Nevada, Arlington, Texas, and
    many areas of Florida. We believe that this positions our
    company to experience internal growth rates that are generally
    higher than our industry’s overall growth rate. In
    addition, we believe that by securing a base of long-term
    recurring revenue in growth markets, we are better able to
    protect our market position from competition and our business
    may be less susceptible to downturns in economic conditions.

Sales and Marketing Activities.

We seek to
    manage our sales and marketing activities to enable our company
    to capitalize on our leading positions in many of the markets in
    which we operate. We currently have approximately 500 sales and
    marketing employees in the field who are compensated using a
    commission structure that is focused on generating high levels
    of quality revenue. For the most part, these employees directly
    solicit business from existing and prospective commercial,
    industrial, municipal and residential customers. We emphasize
    our rate and cost structures when we train new and existing
    sales personnel. In addition, we utilize a contact management
    system that assists our sales people in tracking leads. It also
    tracks renewal periods for potential commercial, industrial and
    franchise contracts.

Development Activities.

We seek to identify
    opportunities to further our position as an integrated service
    provider in markets where we provide services for a portion of
    the waste stream. Where appropriate, we seek to obtain permits
    to build transfer stations

and/or

landfills that would provide vertically integrated waste
    services or expand the service area for our existing disposal
    sites. Development projects, while generally less capital
    intensive, typically require extensive permitting efforts that
    can take years to complete with no assurance of success. We
    undertake development projects when we believe there is a
    reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced
    acquisition opportunities are not available.

•

Acquisition Growth.

During the late
    1990’s, the solid waste industry experienced a period of
    rapid consolidation. We were able to grow significantly through
    acquisitions during this period. However, the rate of
    consolidation in the industry has slowed considerably. Despite
    this, we continue to look to acquire


businesses that complement our existing business platform. Our
    acquisition growth strategy focuses on privately-held solid
    waste companies and municipal and other local governmental
    authorities. We believe that our ability to acquire
    privately-held companies is enhanced by increasing competition
    in the solid waste industry, increasing capital requirements as
    a result of changes in solid waste regulatory requirements, and
    the limited number of exit strategies for these privately-held
    companies’ owners and principals. We also seek to acquire
    operations and facilities from municipalities that are
    privatizing, which occur for many of the same reasons that
    privately-held companies sell their solid waste businesses. In
    addition, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire
    operations and facilities that are being divested by other
    publicly-owned waste companies. In sum, our acquisition growth
    strategy focuses on:

•

acquiring businesses that position our company for growth in
    existing and new markets,

•

acquiring well-managed companies and, when appropriate,
    retaining local management,

•

acquiring operations and facilities from municipalities that are
    privatizing and publicly-owned companies that are divesting of
    assets.

For certain risks involved with our acquisition growth strategy,
    see “Risk Factors — We may be unable to
    execute our acquisition growth strategy,”
    “— We may be unable to manage our growth
    effectively,” and “— Businesses we acquire
    may have undisclosed liabilities.”

Acquire Businesses Positioning the Company for
    Growth.

In making acquisitions, we principally
    target high quality businesses that will allow our company to
    be, or provide our company favorable prospects of becoming, a
    leading provider of integrated solid waste services in markets
    with favorable demographic growth. Generally, we have acquired,
    and will continue to seek to acquire, solid waste collection,
    transfer and disposal companies that:

•

have strong operating margins,

•

are in growth markets,

•

are among the largest or have a significant presence in their
    local markets, and

•

have long-term contracts or franchises with municipalities and
    other customers.

Once we have a base of operations in a particular market, we
    focus on acquiring trucks and routes of smaller businesses that
    also operate in that market and surrounding markets, which are
    typically referred to as “tuck-in” acquisitions. We
    seek to consolidate the operations of such tuck-in businesses
    into our existing operations in that market. We also seek to
    acquire landfills, transfer stations and collection companies
    that operate in markets that we are already servicing in order
    to fully integrate our operations from collection to disposal.
    In addition, we have in the past and may continue in the future
    to exchange businesses with other solid waste companies if by
    doing so there is a net benefit to our business platform. These
    activities allow us to increase our revenue and market share,
    lower our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue, and
    consolidate duplicative facilities and functions to maximize
    cost efficiencies and economies of scale.

Acquire Well-Managed Companies.

We also seek
    to acquire businesses that have experienced management teams
    that are willing to join the management of our company. We
    generally seek to maintain continuity in management of larger
    acquired companies in order to capitalize on their local market
    knowledge, community relations and name recognition, and to
    instill their entrepreneurial drive at all levels of our
    operations. By furnishing the local management of such acquired
    companies with our financial and marketing resources and
    technical expertise, we believe that the acquired companies are
    better able to secure additional municipal franchises and other
    contracts.

Privatize Municipal Operations and Acquire Divested
    Operations.

We also seek to acquire solid waste
    collection operations, transfer stations and landfills that
    municipalities and other governmental authorities are
    privatizing. Many municipalities are seeking to outsource or
    sell these types of solid waste operations, as they lack the
    capital, technical expertise

and/or

operational resources necessary to comply with increasingly
    stringent regulatory standards

and/or

to
    compete effectively with private-sector companies. In addition,
    we


have acquired, and will continue to seek to acquire, operations
    and facilities that are being divested by other publicly-owned
    waste companies.

Operations

Our operations primarily consist of the collection, transfer and
    disposal of non-hazardous solid waste.

Collection Services.

We provide solid waste
    collection services to commercial, industrial, municipal and
    residential customers in 21 states through 140 collection
    companies. In 2005, 74.7% of our revenue was derived from
    collection services consisting of 32.0% from services provided
    to municipal and residential customers, 36.5% from services
    provided to commercial customers, and 31.5% from services
    provided to industrial and other customers.

Our residential collection operations involve the curbside
    collection of refuse from small containers into collection
    vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to
    landfills. Residential solid waste collection services are
    typically performed under contracts with municipalities, which
    we generally secure by competitive bid and which give our
    company exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the
    homes in their respective jurisdictions. These contracts or
    franchises usually range in duration from one to five years,
    although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly
    longer periods. Residential solid waste collection services may
    also be performed on a subscription basis, in which individual
    households contract directly with our company. The fees received
    for subscription residential collection are based primarily on
    market factors, frequency and type of service, the distance to
    the disposal facility and cost of disposal. In general,
    subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in
    advance by the residential customers receiving the service.

In our commercial and industrial collection operations, we
    supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes. We
    also rent compactors to large waste generators. Commercial
    collection services are generally performed under one- to
    three-year service agreements, and fees are determined by such
    considerations as:

•

market factors,

•

collection frequency,

•

type of equipment furnished,

•

the type and volume or weight of the waste collected,

•

the distance to the disposal facility and

•

the cost of disposal.

We rent waste containers to construction sites and also provide
    waste collection services to industrial and construction
    facilities on a contractual basis with terms generally ranging
    from a single pickup to one year or longer. We collect the
    containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to
    a landfill or a transfer station for disposal.

Also, we currently provide recycling services in certain markets
    primarily to comply with local laws or obligations under our
    franchise agreements. These services include the curbside
    collection of residential recyclable waste and the provision of
    a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial
    customers.

Transfer and Disposal Services.

We own or
    operate 92 transfer stations. We deposit waste at these
    stations, as do other private haulers and municipal haulers, for
    compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal
    sites or recycling facilities. As of December 31, 2005, we
    owned or operated 59 landfills, which had approximately
    9,518 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable
    expansion disposal capacity of approximately 1.8 billion
    in-place cubic yards. The in-place capacity of our landfills is
    subject to change based on engineering factors, requirements of
    regulatory authorities and the ability to expand our sites
    successfully. Some of our landfills accept non-hazardous special
    waste, including utility ash, asbestos and contaminated soils.
    See “—  Properties.”

Most of our existing landfill sites have the potential for
    expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted
    acreage. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal
    capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue
    expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste
    volumes and prices, market needs,


remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion. To
    satisfy future disposal demand, we are currently seeking to
    expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills, although
    no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be
    permitted as designed.

Other Services.

We have 32 materials recovery
    facilities and other recycling operations, which are generally
    required to fulfill our obligations under long-term municipal
    contracts for residential collection services. These facilities
    sort recyclable paper, aluminum, glass and other materials. Most
    of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our
    residential collection operations. In some areas, we receive
    commercial and industrial solid waste that is sorted at our
    facilities into recyclable materials and non-recyclable waste.
    The recyclable materials are salvaged, repackaged and sold to
    third parties and the non-recyclable waste is disposed of at
    landfills or incinerators. Wherever possible, our strategy is to
    reduce our exposure to fluctuations in recyclable commodity
    prices by utilizing third-party recycling facilities, thereby
    minimizing our recycling investment.

We provided remediation and other heavy construction services
    primarily through our subsidiary located in Missouri. We sold
    this subsidiary during the fourth quarter of 2005 because it did
    not compliment our core business strategy. During the ten months
    ended October 31, 2005, this business generated revenue of
    $12.9 million and had an operating loss of
    $2.5 million.

We also have a Texas-based compost, mulch and soil business at
    which yard, mill and other waste is processed, packaged and sold
    as various products.

Sales and
    Marketing

We seek to provide quality services that will enable our company
    to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction. We derive our
    business from a broad customer base which we believe will enable
    our company to experience stable growth. We focus our marketing
    efforts on continuing and expanding business with existing
    customers, as well as attracting new customers.

We employ approximately 500 sales and marketing employees. Our
    sales and marketing strategy is to provide high-quality,
    comprehensive solid waste collection, recycling, transfer and
    disposal services to our customers at competitive prices. We
    target potential customers of all sizes, from small quantity
    generators to large “Fortune 500” companies and
    municipalities.

Most of our marketing activity is local in nature. However, we
    also provide a corporate accounts program in response to the
    needs of our customers.

We generally do not change the tradenames of the local
    businesses we acquire, and therefore we do not operate
    nationally under any one mark or tradename. Rather, we rely on
    the goodwill associated with the acquired companies’ local
    tradenames as used in each geographic market in which we operate.

Customers

We provide services to commercial, industrial, municipal and
    residential customers. No one customer has individually
    accounted for more than 10.0% of our consolidated revenue or of
    our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Entry into our
    business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry
    requires substantial amounts of capital and managerial
    experience.

Competition in the non-hazardous solid waste industry comes from
    a few large, national publicly-owned companies, including Waste
    Management and Allied Waste Industries, several regional
    publicly- and privately-owned solid waste companies, and
    thousands of small privately-owned companies. Some of our
    competitors have significantly larger operations, and may have
    significantly greater financial resources, than we do. In
    addition to national and regional firms and numerous local
    companies, we compete with municipalities that maintain waste
    collection or disposal operations. These municipalities may have
    financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenues and
    tax-exempt financing.


We compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of
    price and the quality of our services. From time to time, our
    competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort
    to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal
    contract. This may have an impact on our future revenue and
    profitability.

In each market in which we own or operate a landfill, we compete
    for landfill business on the basis of disposal costs,
    geographical location and quality of operations. Our ability to
    obtain landfill business may be limited by the fact that some
    major collection companies also own or operate landfills to
    which they send their waste. There also has been an increasing
    trend at the state and local levels to mandate waste reduction
    at the source and to prohibit the disposal of certain types of
    waste, such as yard waste, at landfills. This may result in the
    volume of waste going to landfills being reduced in certain
    areas, which may affect our ability to operate our landfills at
    their full capacity

and/or

affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal
    services. In addition, most of the states in which we operate
    landfills have adopted plans or requirements that set goals for
    specified percentages of certain solid waste items to be
    recycled.

Regulation

Our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of
    federal, state and local requirements that regulate the
    environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use.
    Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals are
    generally required for landfills and transfer stations, certain
    solid waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and other
    facilities that we own or operate, and these permits are subject
    to revocation, modification and renewal in certain
    circumstances. Federal, state and local laws and regulations
    vary, but generally govern wastewater or stormwater discharges,
    air emissions, the handling, transportation, treatment, storage
    and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the
    remediation of contamination associated with the release or
    threatened release of hazardous substances. These laws and
    regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers
    of enforcement, which include the ability to obtain injunctions

and/or

impose fines or penalties in the case of violations, including
    criminal penalties. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and
    various other federal, state and local environmental, public and
    occupational health and safety agencies and authorities
    administer these regulations, including the Occupational Safety
    and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor.

We strive to conduct our operations in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations. However, in the existing
    climate of heightened environmental concerns, from time to time,
    we have been issued citations or notices from governmental
    authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for
    remedial work and related activities at various landfills and
    other facilities. There is no assurance that citations and
    notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory
    compliance efforts. We have established final capping, closure,
    post-closure and remediation liabilities that we believe, based
    on currently available information, will be adequate to cover
    our current estimates of regulatory costs. However, we cannot
    assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves.

Federal Regulation.

The following summarizes
    the primary environmental, public and occupational health and
    safety-related statutes of the United States that affect our
    facilities and operations:

(1)

The Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, including
    the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

RCRA
    and its implementing regulations establish a framework for
    regulating the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and
    disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste, and require
    states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid
    waste in sanitary landfills.

Subtitle D of RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the
    disposal of municipal solid waste. Regulations under Subtitle D
    currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management
    criteria and guidelines, including location restrictions,
    facility design and operating criteria, final capping, closure
    and post-closure requirements, financial assurance standards,
    groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action
    standards, many of which had not commonly been in effect or
    enforced in the past in connection with municipal solid waste
    landfills. Each state was required to submit to the
    U.S. EPA a permit program designed to implement Subtitle D
    regulations by April 9, 1993. All of the states in which we
    operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to RCRA and
    Subtitle D. These state permit programs may include landfill
    requirements which are more stringent than those of Subtitle D.


All of our planned landfill expansions or new landfill
    development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed
    Subtitle D requirements. Operating and design criteria for
    existing operations have been modified to comply with these new
    regulations. Compliance with Subtitle D regulations has resulted
    in increased costs and may in the future require substantial
    additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally
    associated with our waste management activities.

(2)

The Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as
    amended.

CERCLA, among other things, provides for
    the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened
    release of a hazardous substance into the environment. CERCLA
    may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of
    cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners
    and operators of the site, parties who were owners or operators
    of the site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed
    of, parties who transported the hazardous substances to the site
    and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous
    substances at the site. Under the authority of CERCLA and its
    implementing regulations, detailed requirements apply to the
    manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities
    and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened
    to be released into the environment. Liability under CERCLA is
    not dependent upon the existence or disposal of only
    “hazardous wastes” but can also be based upon the
    existence of small quantities of more than 700
    “substances” characterized by the U.S. EPA as
    “hazardous,” many of which may be found in common
    household waste.

Among other things, CERCLA authorizes the federal government to
    investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances
    have been or are threatened to be released into the environment
    or to order (or offer an opportunity to) persons potentially
    liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so. In
    addition, the U.S. EPA has established a National
    Priorities List of sites at which hazardous substances have been
    or are threatened to be released and which require investigation
    or cleanup.

Liability under CERCLA is not dependent upon the intentional
    disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances. It can be
    founded upon the release or threatened release, even as a result
    of unintentional, non-negligent or lawful action, of thousands
    of hazardous substances, including very small quantities of such
    substances. Thus, even if our landfills have never knowingly
    received hazardous waste as such, it is possible that one or
    more hazardous substances may have been deposited or
    “released” at our landfills or at other properties
    which we currently own or operate or may have owned or operated.
    Therefore, we could be liable under CERCLA for the cost of
    cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for
    damages to natural resources, even if those substances were
    deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them.
    The costs of a CERCLA cleanup can be very expensive. Given the
    difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment
    liability, such liability could have a material impact on our
    business and financial condition. For a further discussion, see
    “— Liability Insurance and Bonding.”

(3)

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as
    amended.

This Act regulates the discharge of
    pollutants from a variety of sources, including solid waste
    disposal sites, into streams, rivers and other waters of the
    United States. Point source runoff from our landfills and
    transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters must be
    covered by discharge permits that generally require us to
    conduct sampling and monitoring, and under certain
    circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those
    discharges. Storm water discharge regulations under this Act
    require a permit for certain construction activities and
    discharges from industrial operations and facilities, which may
    affect our operations. If a landfill or transfer station
    discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a
    publicly-owned treatment works, the facility must comply with
    discharge limits imposed by that treatment works. In addition,
    states may adopt groundwater protection programs under this Act
    or the Safe Drinking Water Act that could affect solid waste
    landfills. Furthermore, development which alters or affects
    wetlands must generally be permitted prior to such development
    commencing, and certain mitigation requirements may be required
    by the permitting agencies.

(4)

The Clean Air Act, as amended.

The
    Clean Air Act imposes limitations on emissions from various
    sources, including landfills. In March 1996, the U.S. EPA
    promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste
    landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems. These
    regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction,
    reconstruction or modification on or after May 30, 1991,
    and, principally, to landfills that can accommodate
    2.5 million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste.
    The regulations apply


whether the landfill is active or closed. The date by which each
    affected landfill is required to have a gas collection and
    control system installed and made operational varies depending
    upon calculated emission rates at the landfill. Many state
    regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems
    for the collection and control of certain landfill gas. We do
    not expect that compliance with any new state regulations will
    have a material effect on us.

(5)

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as
    amended.

This Act authorizes the Occupational
    Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor
    to promulgate occupational safety and health standards. A number
    of these standards, including standards for notices of hazardous
    chemicals and the handling of asbestos, apply to our facilities
    and operations.

State Regulation.

Each state in which we
    operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste
    disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases
    and cleanup of hazardous substances and liability for such
    matters. States also have adopted regulations governing the
    design, operation, maintenance and closure of landfills and
    transfer stations. Our facilities and operations are likely to
    be subject to these types of requirements. In addition, our
    solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected
    by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of
    solid waste reduction and recycling programs. For example,
    several states have enacted laws that require counties or
    municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce, through
    solid waste planning, composting, recycling or other programs,
    the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills. Additionally,
    laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste
    in solid waste landfills, including yard waste, newspapers,
    beverage containers, unshredded tires, lead-acid batteries and
    household appliances, have been promulgated in several states
    and are being considered in others. Legislative and regulatory
    measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source
    and waste recycling also are or have been under consideration by
    the U.S. Congress and the U.S. EPA, respectively.

In order to construct, expand and operate a landfill, one or
    more construction or operating permits, as well as zoning and
    land use approvals, must be obtained. These are difficult and
    time-consuming to obtain, are often opposed by neighboring
    landowners and citizens’ groups, may be subject to periodic
    renewal, and are subject to modification and revocation by the
    issuing agency. In connection with our acquisition of existing
    landfills, it may be and on occasion has been necessary for our
    company to expend considerable time, effort and money to bring
    the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable
    requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary
    to increase their capacity.

Many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks
    which are generally used to store petroleum-based products.
    These tanks are generally subject to federal, state and local
    laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing,
    upgrading, closure and removal, and that, in the event of leaks,
    require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated. We
    believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently
    meet, in all material respects, all applicable regulations. If
    underground storage tanks we own or operate leak, and the
    leakage migrates onto the property of others, we could be liable
    for response costs and other damages to third parties. We are
    unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with
    regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Finally, with regard to our solid waste transportation
    operations, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface
    Transportation Board and are regulated by the Federal Highway
    Administration, Office of Motor Carriers, and by regulatory
    agencies in states that regulate such matters. Various states
    have enacted or promulgated, or are considering enacting or
    promulgating, laws and regulations that would restrict the
    interstate transportation and processing of solid waste. In
    1978, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a law that
    restricts the importation of

out-of-state

solid waste was unconstitutional; however, states have attempted
    to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and
    implicated by that ruling. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled that
    a flow control law, which attempted to restrict solid waste from
    leaving its place of generation, imposed an impermissible burden
    upon interstate commerce, and, therefore, was unconstitutional;
    however, states have also attempted to distinguish proposed laws
    from those involved in and implicated by that ruling. In
    response to these Supreme Court rulings, the U.S. Congress
    has considered passing legislation authorizing states and local
    governments to restrict the free movement of solid waste in
    interstate commerce. If federal legislation authorizing state
    and local governments to


restrict the free movement of solid waste in interstate commerce
    is enacted, such legislation could adversely affect our
    operations.

We have established liabilities for landfill and environmental
    costs, which includes landfill site final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs. We periodically reassess such costs based on
    various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and
    the technical requirements of Subtitle D of RCRA and adjust our
    rates used to expense final capping, closure and post-closure
    costs accordingly. Based on current information and regulatory
    requirements, we believe that our liabilities recorded for such
    landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate. However,
    environmental laws may change, and there can be no assurance
    that our recorded liabilities will be adequate to cover
    requirements under existing or new environmental laws and
    regulations, future changes or interpretations of existing laws
    and regulations, or the identification of adverse environmental
    conditions previously unknown to us. See “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Landfill and Environmental
    Matters” and “Risk Factors — Compliance
    with environmental and other laws and regulations may impede our
    growth.”

Liability
    Insurance and Bonding

The nature of our business exposes our company to the risk of
    liabilities arising out of our operations, including possible
    damages to the environment. Such potential liabilities could
    involve, for example, claims for remediation costs, personal
    injury, property damage and damage to the environment in cases
    where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful
    materials; claims of employees, customers or third parties for
    personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of
    our operations; or claims alleging negligence in the planning or
    performance of work. We could also be subject to fines and civil
    and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of
    regulatory requirements. Because of the nature and scope of the
    possible environmental damages, liabilities imposed in
    environmental litigation can be significant. Our solid waste
    operations have third-party environmental liability insurance
    with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations,
    subject to certain limitations and exclusions. However, we
    cannot assure you that the limits of such environmental
    liability insurance would be adequate in the event of a major
    loss, nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry
    excess environmental liability insurance should market
    conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs
    prohibitive.

We have general liability, vehicle liability, employment
    practices liability, pollution liability, directors and officers
    liability, worker’s compensation and employer’s
    liability coverage, as well as umbrella liability policies to
    provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in
    these primary policies. We also carry property insurance.
    Although we try to operate safely and prudently and while we
    have, subject to limitations and exclusions, substantial
    liability insurance, no assurance can be given that we will not
    be exposed to uninsured liabilities which could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows.

Our insurance programs for worker’s compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. Claims in excess of
    self-insurance levels are fully insured subject to policy
    limits. Accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial
    estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not
    reported. Due to the variable condition of the insurance market,
    we have experienced, and may continue to experience in the
    future, increased self-insurance retention levels and increased
    premiums. As we assume more risk for self-insurance through
    higher retention levels, we may experience more variability in
    our self-insurance reserves and expense.

In the normal course of business, we may be required to post
    performance bonds, insurance policies, letters of credit

and/or

cash
    or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal
    residential collection contracts, the operation, closure or
    post-closure of landfills, certain remediation contracts,
    certain environmental permits, and certain business licenses and
    permits as a financial guarantee of our performance. To date, we
    have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making
    cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank
    letters of credit, insurance policies or surety bonds.


Employees

As of December 31, 2005, we employed approximately
    13,000 full-time employees, approximately 3,200 of whom
    were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our management
    believes that we have good relations with our employees.

Compensation

We believe that our compensation program effectively aligns our
    field and corporate management team with the company’s
    overall goal of generating increasing amounts of free cash flow
    while achieving targeted earnings and returns on invested
    capital. This is done by utilizing simple and measurable metrics
    on which incentive pay is based. At the field level, these
    metrics are based upon free cash flow, earnings and return on
    invested capital for each manager’s geographic area of
    responsibility. Great effort is taken to ensure that these
    individual goals agree to the overall goals of the company.
    Incentive compensation at the corporate level is based on the
    obtainment of our company’s overall goals. In addition,
    certain field and corporate employees also participate in a
    long-term incentive program. We believe this program aligns our
    company’s short- and long-term goals and helps ensure that
    the long-term success of our company is not sacrificed for the
    obtainment of short-term goals.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Risk
    Factors

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

includes “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934, as amended, including, in particular, certain statements
    about our plans, strategies and prospects. Although we believe
    that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or
    suggested by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we
    cannot assure you that such plans, intentions or expectations
    will be achieved. Important factors that could cause our actual
    results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements
    include those set forth in this Risk Factors section. All
    forward-looking statements attributable to us or any persons
    acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety
    by the cautionary statements set forth below. Unless the context
    requires otherwise, all references to the “company,”
    “we,” “us” or “our” include
    Republic Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

If any of the following risks, or other risks not presently
    known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant,
    develop into actual events, then our business, financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could
    be materially adversely affected.

We
    operate in a highly competitive industry and may be unable to
    compete effectively.

We operate in a highly competitive business environment. Some of
    our competitors have significantly larger operations and may
    have significantly greater financial resources than we do. In
    addition, the solid waste industry is constantly changing as a
    result of consolidation which may create additional competitive
    pressures in our business environment.


We also compete with municipalities that maintain their own
    waste collection or disposal operations. These municipalities
    may have a financial advantage over us as a result of the
    availability of tax revenue and tax-exempt financing.

We compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of
    price and the quality of services. From time to time our
    competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort
    to expand their market share or to win competitively bid
    municipal contracts.

In each market in which we own or operate a landfill, we compete
    for solid waste volume on the basis of disposal or
    “tipping” fees, geographical location and quality of
    operations. Our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our
    landfills may be limited by the fact that some major collection
    companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their
    waste. In markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill,
    our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully
    integrated competitors.

As a result of these factors, we may have difficulty competing
    effectively from time to time.

Economic
    conditions could adversely affect our business, operations and
    internal growth.

In the past, economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the
    portion of our collection business servicing the manufacturing
    sector and the non-residential construction industry. Landfill
    volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity
    were also impacted. A slowdown in the economy in any of the
    markets we service could adversely affect volumes, pricing and
    operating margins in our collection, transfer and disposal
    operations.

An
    increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our
    business.

Our operations are dependent upon fuel, which we generally
    purchase in the open market on a daily basis. Direct fuel costs
    include the cost of fuel and other petroleum-based products used
    to operate our fleet of vehicles and heavy equipment. We are
    also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel costs which
    include fuel surcharges from vendors, increased construction and
    excavation costs, and increases in the costs of other
    petroleum-based products such as synthetic landfill liners.
    During 2003, 2004 and 2005, we experienced increases in the cost
    of fuel and other petroleum-based products. A portion of these
    increases was passed on to our customers. However, because of
    the competitive nature of the waste industry, there can be no
    assurance that we will be able to pass on current or future
    increases in fuel prices to our customers. Due to political
    instability in oil-producing countries, fuel prices may continue
    to increase significantly in 2006. A significant increase in
    fuel costs could adversely affect our business.

We may be
    unable to execute our financial strategy.

Our ability to execute our financial strategy is dependent upon
    our ability to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior
    debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon a number of
    factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Our financial strategy is also dependent upon our ability to
    generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing
    business, fund our internal growth, acquire other solid waste
    businesses, repurchase shares of our common stock, pay
    dividends, minimize our borrowings and take other actions to
    enhance stockholder value. We cannot assure you that we will be
    successful in executing our broad-based pricing program, that we
    will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial
    strategy, that we will continue to repurchase our common stock,
    or that we will be able to pay cash dividends or increase the
    amount of our dividends.

We may be
    unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy.

Our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on
    our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition
    candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate
    acquired operations into our business. The consolidation of our
    operations with the operations of acquired companies, including
    the consolidation of systems, procedures, personnel and
    facilities, the relocation of staff, and the achievement of
    anticipated cost savings,


economies of scale and other business efficiencies, presents
    significant challenges to our management, particularly if
    several acquisitions occur at the same time. In short, we cannot
    assure you that:

•

desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified,

•

we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified,

•

we will effectively consolidate companies which are acquired and
    fully or timely realize the expected cost savings, economies of
    scale or business efficiencies, or

•

any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings.

Additional factors may negatively impact our acquisition growth
    strategy. Our acquisition strategy may require spending
    significant amounts of capital. If we are unable to obtain
    additional needed financing on acceptable terms, we may need to
    reduce the scope of our acquisition growth strategy, which could
    have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects. The
    intense competition among our competitors pursuing the same
    acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for solid
    waste businesses and increase our capital requirements

and/or

prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates. If any
    of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth
    strategy, our financial condition, results of operations and
    growth prospects could be adversely affected.

We may be
    unable to manage our growth effectively.

Our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial,
    operational and management resources. In order to continue our
    growth, we will need to add administrative and other personnel,
    and make additional investments in operations and systems. We
    cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train
    qualified personnel, or do so on a timely basis, or expand our
    operations and systems to the extent, and in the time, required.

Businesses
    we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities.

In pursuing our acquisition strategy, our investigations of the
    acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed
    liabilities of the acquisition candidates. If we acquire a
    company having undisclosed liabilities, as a successor owner we
    may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities. We
    typically try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by
    obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired
    companies, by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase
    price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only
    specified assets. However, we cannot assure you that we will be
    able to obtain indemnifications or that they will be
    enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or
    duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising
    from our acquisitions.

Our
    financial statements are based upon estimates and assumptions
    that may differ from actual results.

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily
    include amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by us.
    Actual results could differ from these amounts. Significant
    items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the
    carrying value of long-lived assets, the depletion and
    amortization of landfill development costs, accruals for final
    capping, closure and post-closure costs, valuation allowances
    for accounts receivable, liabilities for potential litigation,
    claims and assessments, and liabilities for environmental
    remediation, deferred taxes and self-insurance.

We cannot assure you that our liabilities recorded for landfill
    and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the
    requirements of existing environmental regulations, future
    changes to or interpretations of existing regulations, or the
    identification of adverse environmental conditions previously
    unknown to us.

Changes
    in insurance markets may impact our financial results.

Due to the variable condition of the insurance market, we have
    experienced, and may continue to experience in the future,
    increased self-insurance retention levels and increased
    premiums. As we assume more risk for self-insurance through
    higher retention levels, we may experience more variability in
    our self-insurance reserves and expense.


We depend
    on key personnel.

Our future success depends on the continued contributions of
    several key employees and officers. We do not maintain key man
    life insurance policies on any of our officers. The loss of the
    services of key employees and officers, whether such loss is
    through resignation or other causes, or the inability to attract
    additional qualified personnel, could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
    growth prospects.

Compliance
    with environmental and other laws and regulations may impede our
    growth.

We may need to spend considerable time, effort and capital to
    keep our facilities in compliance with federal, state and local
    requirements regulating health, safety, environment, zoning,
    land use and transportation. In addition, some of our waste
    operations that cross state boundaries could be adversely
    affected if the federal government, or the state or locality in
    which these waste operations are located, imposes fees on, or
    otherwise limits or prohibits, the transportation or disposal of
    solid waste. If environmental laws become more stringent, our
    environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental
    compliance may increase in the future. In addition, due to the
    possibility of unanticipated events or regulatory developments,
    the amounts and timing of future environmental expenditures
    could vary substantially from those we currently anticipate.
    Because of the nature of our operations, we have in the past,
    currently are, and may in the future be named as a potentially
    responsible party in connection with the investigation or
    remediation of environmental conditions. We cannot assure you
    that the resolution of any such investigations will not have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows. A significant judgment or fine against
    our company, or our loss of significant permits or licenses,
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    results of operations, cash flows or prospects.

Regulatory
    approval to develop or expand our landfills and transfer
    stations may be delayed or denied.

Our plans include developing new landfills and transfer
    stations, as well as expanding the disposal and transfer
    capacities of certain of our landfills and transfer stations,
    respectively. Various parties, including citizens’ groups
    and local politicians, sometimes challenge these projects.
    Responding to these challenges has, at times, increased our
    costs and extended the time associated with establishing new
    facilities and expanding existing facilities. In addition,
    failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit
    us from establishing new facilities and expanding existing
    facilities.

Seasonal
    changes may adversely affect our business and
    operations.

Our operations may be adversely affected by periods of inclement
    weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under
    our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation),
    delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of
    waste delivered to our disposal sites, or delay the construction
    or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities.

The
    outcome of audits by the Internal Revenue Service may adversely
    affect our company.

The Internal Revenue Service is auditing our consolidated tax
    returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2004. No assurance can be
    given with respect to the outcome of the audits for these
    periods or the effect they may have on us, or that our reserves
    with respect thereto are adequate. A significant assessment
    against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

On February 16, 2006 the last reported sales price of our
    common stock was $39.21.

There were approximately 87 record holders of our common stock
    at February 16, 2006, which does not include beneficial
    owners for whom Cede & Co. or others act as nominees.

In January 2006, our board of directors declared a regular
    quarterly dividend of $.14 per share for stockholders of
    record on April 3, 2006. We expect to continue to pay
    quarterly cash dividends, and our board of directors may
    consider increasing our quarterly cash dividends if we believe
    it will enhance stockholder value.

From 2000 through 2005, our board of directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $1,525.0 million of our common stock.
    As of December 31, 2005, we paid $1,308.8 million to
    repurchase 51.5 million shares of our common stock, of
    which 16.3 million shares were acquired during 2005 for
    $558.4 million. As of December 31, 2005, we had
    $216.2 million remaining under our share repurchase
    authorization. In January 2006, our board of directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to an additional
    $275.0 million of our common stock.

We have the ability under our loan covenants to pay dividends
    and repurchase our common stock under the condition that we are
    in compliance with the covenants. As of December 31, 2005,
    we were in compliance with the financial covenants of our loan
    agreements.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our
    Consolidated Financial Statements and their Notes contained in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Overview
    of Our Business

We are a leading provider of non-hazardous solid waste
    collection and disposal services in the United States. We
    provide solid waste collection services for commercial,
    industrial, municipal and residential customers through 140
    collection companies in 21 states. We also own or operate
    92 transfer stations, 59 solid waste landfills and
    32 recycling facilities.

We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection
    operations. Our remaining revenue is from other services
    including landfill disposal, recycling, compost, mulch and soil
    operations.

The following table reflects our revenue by source for the years
    ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in millions):

Our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we
    receive from commercial, industrial, municipal and residential
    customers. Our residential and commercial collection operations
    in some markets are based on long-term contracts with
    municipalities. We generally provide industrial and commercial
    collection services to individual customers under contracts with
    terms up to three years. Our revenue from landfill operations is
    from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. In
    general, we integrate our recycling operations with our
    collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of
    recyclable materials. No one customer has individually accounted
    for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of our
    reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years.

The cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and
    includes disposal, labor, self-insurance, fuel and equipment
    maintenance costs. We seek operating efficiencies by controlling
    the movement of waste from the point of collection through
    disposal. During the three months ended December 31, 2005
    and 2004, approximately 57% and 54%, respectively, of the total
    volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own
    or operate.

Our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of
    capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure
    and post-closure, and the legal and administrative costs of
    ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses
    include leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and
    groundwater monitoring and system maintenance, interim cap
    maintenance, and costs associated with the application of daily
    cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development
    costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to
    cell development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs
    are capitalized, and charged to expense based upon the
    consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These costs
    include all costs to acquire and construct a site including
    excavation, natural and


synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems,
    installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems,
    installation of groundwater monitoring wells, and other costs
    associated with the acquisition and development of the site.
    Obligations associated with final capping, closure and
    post-closure are capitalized, and amortized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed.

Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and
    accounting personnel to adjust our rates used to expense
    capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate
    to changes in costs, available airspace, inflation and
    applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include
    changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace
    lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable
    likelihood of being permitted.

    segments for the respective years ended December 31, 2005,

Consists of adjustments to amortization expense for changes in
    estimates and assumptions related to our annual review of
    landfill asset retirement obligations under SFAS 143.


Our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions
    that we designate as our reportable segments. From 2004 to 2005,
    operating income increased in all of our regions due to the
    successful execution of our pricing strategy.

•

During the first quarter of 2005, we divested of our operations
    in western New York which reduced revenue in our Eastern Region.
    This reduction in revenue was almost completely offset by
    increases in prices. Operating margins improved because of
    increases in prices and lower average disposal costs resulting
    from the New York divestiture.

•

In our Central Region, price increases and acquisitions resulted
    in higher revenue during 2005 compared to 2004. Operating
    margins decreased primarily due to higher fuel costs partially
    offset by lower subcontracting and third-party hauling costs.

•

Our operations in the Southern Region benefited from stronger
    volumes in our collection, transfer and landfill businesses.
    Operating margins decreased primarily due to higher fuel costs
    partially offset by decreases in labor and maintenance costs
    resulting from operating efficiencies.

•

In our Southwestern Region, increased revenue resulting from
    increased prices and volumes was partially offset by a decrease
    in revenue at our remediation and heavy construction services
    business. This business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2005.
    Operating margins improved because of a decrease in
    subcontracting costs and due to adjustments to landfill
    amortization expense associated with SFAS 143.

•

In our Western Region, increases in prices and volumes in our
    collection, transfer and landfill operations resulted in higher
    revenue during 2005 compared to 2004. Operating margins
    decreased because of higher fuel and disposal costs and because
    of adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with
    SFAS 143.

•

The increase in operating loss for Corporate Entities from 2004
    to 2005 is primarily due to higher compensation and other costs
    related to the expansion of our business, approximately
    $3.0 million of costs associated with the exchange of
    unsecured notes during 2005 and $2.1 million related to the
    acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options in
    2005.

The increase in operating income from 2003 to 2004 in total and
    for each of our regions was partially due to a decrease in
    self-insurance expense. Operating income increased in our
    Eastern, Southern and Western Regions due to an overall increase
    in revenue resulting from the successful execution of our growth
    strategy. In the Central Region, increased revenue was partially
    offset by weak economic conditions and an increase in costs
    related to the long-haul transport of waste by third-party
    vendors. In the Southwestern Region, revenue growth was impeded
    by the closure of a landfill and the completion of a special
    waste contract during 2003. The increase in costs for Corporate
    Entities from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the expansion of
    our business.

    Financial Objectives

In January 2005, we publicly announced our objectives for the
    year. These objectives included the following:

•

Generating free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) of approximately
    of $260 million.

•

Using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common
    stock under our $275.0 million share repurchase program
    approved by our board of directors in October 2004 and
    continuing to pay quarterly cash dividends.

•

Generating diluted earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.70.

•

Growing revenue from core operations in the range of 4.0% to
    4.5%, with 2.5% attributable to price increases and 1.5% to 2.0%
    attributable to volume growth.

•

Purchasing approximately $300 million of property and
    equipment.

    Business Performance

During 2005, we exceeded all of our financial objectives.


Our internal growth from core operations for 2005 was 6.1%, with
    3.8% from price increases and 2.3% from volume growth. During
    2005, our revenue growth from core pricing benefited from a
    broad-based pricing initiative which we started during the
    fourth quarter of 2003. We also secured broad-based price
    increases to offset various escalating capital and operating
    costs, including fuel. We experienced core volume growth in all
    lines of our business, including our residential collection
    business resulting from the addition of several new municipal
    contracts, and our landfill and transfer station businesses
    resulting from newly opened sites and new contracts. Our core
    volume growth was also positively impacted by hurricane

clean-up

efforts. In addition, our geographic mix of business, which is
    concentrated in high growth markets, positively impacted our
    operating results. As a result, during 2005 we were able to
    exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the
    beginning of the year.

Our operating margins in 2005 remained consistent with those
    achieved during 2004. During 2005, significantly higher fuel
    costs were offset by improved pricing, lower self-insurance
    expense and continued focus on productivity improvements.

During 2005, we generated free cash flow of $448.9 million
    (consisting of cash provided by operating activities of
    $767.5 million, less purchases of property and equipment of
    $328.7 million, plus proceeds from sales of property and
    equipment of $10.1 million), which substantially exceeded
    our objective. Our free cash flow was positively impacted by a
    $113.4 million federal tax payment that was deferred until
    February 2006 as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice
    issued in response to Hurricane Katrina, and the timing of
    payments for capital and other expenditures.

During 2005, we used our free cash flow to repurchase
    16.3 million shares of our common stock, or approximately
    11% of our outstanding shares, for $558.4 million. Also,
    during the third quarter of 2005, our board of directors
    increased our quarterly dividend to $.14 per share.

During 2005, we generated diluted earnings per share of $1.75
    which significantly exceeded our objective.

    Financial Objectives

Our financial objectives for 2006 assume no deterioration or
    improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during
    the fourth quarter of 2005. Specific guidance is as follows:

•

We expect to generate normalized free cash flow in excess of
    100% of net income, or approximately $270 million to
    $280 million. Normalized free cash flow excludes
    $113.4 million of federal tax payments and approximately
    $60 million of payments for capital and other expenditures
    that relate to 2005 that will be made during 2006.

•

We anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to repurchase
    shares of our common stock under our existing
    $216.2 million share repurchase program and our
    $275.0 million share repurchase program approved by our
    board of directors in January 2006. We also anticipate using our
    free cash flow to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends.

•

We anticipate diluted earnings per share of $1.90 to $1.93.

•

We are targeting internal growth from core operations to be
    approximately 5.0%, with 3.5% attributable to price increases
    and 1.5% attributable to volume growth.

•

We anticipate purchasing approximately $315 million of
    property and equipment, net of sales of property and equipment.

    Business Initiatives

Our business initiatives for 2006 are generally a continuation
    of those initiated in prior years and are dependent on further
    standardizing our business processes and improving our systems.
    Ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and
    processes and are trained on our systems is essential to the
    overall success of our initiatives. Our business initiatives for
    2006 are as follows:

•

Pricing initiatives.

During the fourth quarter
    of 2003, we implemented a broad-based pricing initiative across
    all lines of our business. The purpose of this initiative is to
    recover increasing costs and improve


operating margins. We realized the benefit of this initiative
    during 2004 and 2005 and expect a continuing benefit during 2006.

•

Improve Business Integration.

During 2005 we
    took a number of steps to further strengthen our business
    platform and improve our business integration. In response to
    limited vertical integration opportunities, we divested of our
    operations in western New York. We acquired a landfill in the
    Dallas/Fort Worth area which better integrated that marketplace.
    In addition, we divested of our remediation and heavy
    construction services business because it did not compliment our
    core business strategy. We plan to continue to develop and
    implement strategies that improve the performance of locations
    and lines of business that are performing below the
    company’s average. To achieve this objective, we may
    purchase operations from or exchange operations with other solid
    waste companies in the future.

•

Improve the quality of our revenue.

The first
    step in this process was completed in 2001 and included
    installing a standardized billing and operating system. This
    system enables us to, among other things, stratify our customers
    to determine how our rates compare to current market pricing.
    During 2002, we implemented the second generation of this
    software which we call RSI 1.0. RSI 1.0, our company’s core
    business system, provides a variety of functionalities including
    customer service, dispatch, billing, sales analysis, account
    retention and route productivity analysis. During 2006, we will
    complete the development of the next generation of our billing
    and operating system. This system will provide additional
    functionality to our operating locations and further standardize
    our billing and operating processes.

We currently monitor our return on investment by marketplace and
    have instituted a return on investment pricing model. This model
    will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by
    customer.

During 2001, we also implemented a customer relationship
    management system. This system improves the productivity of our
    sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and
    track sales leads. It also tracks renewal periods for potential
    commercial, industrial and franchise contracts. During 2006, we
    will continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on
    this system and is using it as intended.

•

Improve the productivity of our operations.

We
    use a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the
    performance of our drivers. In addition, in our larger markets,
    we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and
    improve operational density. During 2006, we will continue to
    update our disposal optimization metrics. These metrics identify
    which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested
    capital and cash flow.

•

Improve fleet management and procurement.

In
    February 2002, we selected Dossier as our fleet management and
    parts procurement system. During 2003, we implemented Dossier at
    all of our significant hauling and landfill operations. Among
    other features, this system tracks parts inventories, generates
    automatic quantity order points and logs all maintenance work.
    It allows us to capture and review information to ensure our
    preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers’
    warranties and governmental regulations. In addition, the
    purchase order module within this system allows us to
    cross-reference purchasing information with our inventory.
    During 2006, we intend to further utilize this purchase order
    module to take advantage of volume discounts.

•

Enhance operational and financial reporting
    systems.

We have several initiatives aimed at
    improving our operational and financial reporting systems. The
    overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed
    information, prepared in a consistent manner that will allow us
    to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business.

One of our most significant systems is our enterprise-wide
    general ledger package. We successfully converted all of our
    locations to Lawson general ledger software in 2002 and in 2003
    successfully converted all of our locations to Lawson fixed
    asset software.

All of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us
    with more consistent and detailed information, thus allowing us
    to make quicker and more informed business decisions. In
    addition, during 2001, all of our significant software
    applications were standardized and centralized at our data
    center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This standardization
    and centralization provides us with consolidated information
    concerning our


operations across a variety of operational and financial
    disciplines. It also significantly enhances our ability to
    execute our disaster recovery plan.

During 2006 we will begin to develop an enterprise-wide human
    resource information system. This system will provide a number
    of direct benefits including a reduction in payroll processing
    and compliance costs and integration into our general ledger
    software. It will also provide a number of indirect benefits
    including better information concerning labor and related costs
    and better control over employee-related initiatives such as
    training. We expect to implement this new system in 2007.

•

Expand our safety training programs.

As part
    of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices and in light of
    increasing insurance costs, we expanded our safety training
    programs in 2002. During 2004, we distributed to all of our
    locations a comprehensive training and safety manual. Safety
    will continue to be a key area of focus during 2006.


Critical
    Accounting Policies and Disclosures

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by
    management. The following is a list of accounting policies that
    we believe are the most critical in understanding our
    company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows, and may require management to make subjective or
    complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain:

    Accounting:

Life Cycle Accounting

We use life cycle accounting and
    the units-of-consumption method to recognize certain landfill
    costs over the life of the site. In life cycle accounting, all
    costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized, and
    charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of
    available airspace. Obligations associated with final capping,
    closure and post-closure are capitalized, and amortized on a
    units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed.

Cost and airspace estimates are
    developed at least annually by engineers. Changes in these
    estimates could significantly affect our amortization,
    depletion, and accretion expense.

    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Landfill and Environmental
    Matters.

Note 3, Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Probable Expansion Airspace

We include in our calculation of
    total available airspace expansion areas that we believe have a
    probable likelihood that the expansion area will ultimately be
    permitted.

We have developed six criteria
    that must be met before an expansion area is designated as
    probable expansion airspace. We believe that satisfying each of
    these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion
    airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be
    permitted. However, because some of these criteria are
    judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will
    eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will
    not be permitted. In either of these scenarios, our
    amortization, depletion and accretion expense could change
    significantly.

Final Capping, Closure and
    Post-Closure

Prior to January 1, 2003,
    costs for final closure of our landfills and costs for providing
    required post-closure monitoring and maintenance were charged to
    cost of operations based upon consumed airspace using the

units-of-consumption

method. These costs were not inflated or discounted to the
    present value of total estimated costs. On January 1, 2003,
    we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143,
    ‘‘Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”
    Under SFAS 143, obligations associated with final capping
    activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill
    are recognized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping
    event. Obligations related to closure and post-closure
    activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations
    are recognized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire landfill
    life. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the
    related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the

units-of-consumption

method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or
    the airspace consumed throughout the entire landfill, depending
    upon the nature of the obligation. All obligations are initially
    measured at estimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a
    present value basis using an inflation rate and the
    company’s credit-adjusted, risk-free rate.

Total future costs for final
    capping, closure and post-closure are developed at least
    annually by engineers. Changes in these estimates could affect
    our amortization of final capping, closure and post-closure
    costs and our accretion expense.

Self-Insurance:

Our insurance programs for
    worker’s compensation, general liability, vehicle liability
    and employee-related health care benefits are effectively
    self-insured. Self-insurance accruals are based on claims
    reported and actuarial estimates of claims development and
    claims incurred but not reported.

Estimates of claims development
    and claims incurred but not reported are developed actuarially.
    If actual claims experience or development is significantly
    different than our estimates, our self-insurance expense would
    change.

Property and

Expenditures for Improvements,
    Repairs and Maintenance

Expenditures for major additions
    and improvements to facilities are capitalized. All expenditures
    for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.

Whether certain expenditures
    improve an asset or lengthen its useful life is subject to our
    judgment. Accordingly, the actual useful lives of our assets
    could differ from our estimates.

Useful Lives

Property and equipment are

    provided over the estimated useful lives of the applicable
    assets using the straight-line method. The estimated useful
    lives are seven to forty years for buildings and improvements,
    five to twelve years for vehicles, seven to ten years for most
    landfill equipment, three to fifteen years for all other
    equipment, and five to twelve years for furniture and fixtures.

Our estimates regarding the useful
    lives of our depreciable assets are based on our judgment.
    Accordingly, actual useful lives could differ from our estimates.

Capitalized Interest

We capitalize interest on landfill
    cell construction and other construction projects in accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34,
    “Capitalization of Interest Cost.”

Capitalizing too little or too
    much interest expense could lead to a misstatement of interest
    expense in the consolidated statement of income. In order to
    minimize this risk, construction projects must meet the
    following criteria before interest is capitalized:

1. Total construction costs are $50,000 or greater,

2. the construction phase is one month or longer, and

3. the assets have a useful life of one year or longer.

Revenue and Accounts
    Receivable:

Revenue consists primarily of
    collection fees from various customer types and transfer and
    landfill disposal fees charged to third parties. Advance
    billings are recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue is recognized
    over the period in which services are provided. No one customer
    has individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated
    revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the past
    three years. Reserves for accounts receivable are provided when
    a receivable is believed to be uncollectible or generally when a
    receivable is in excess of 90 days old.

Establishing reserves against
    specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our
    accounts receivable reserve is a matter of judgment. If our
    judgment and estimates concerning the adequacy of our reserve
    for accounts receivable is incorrect, bad debt expense would
    change.

Derivatives:

From time to time, we use

    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

The hedging relationships we have
    entered into are expected to be either 100% effective or highly

Long-Lived Asset
    Impairments:

Long-lived assets consist
    primarily of property, equipment, goodwill and other intangible
    assets. We periodically evaluate whether events and
    circumstances have occurred (as further described in Note 2
    of the Consolidated Financial Statements) that may warrant
    revision of the estimated useful life of long-lived assets or
    whether the remaining balance of these assets should be
    evaluated for possible impairment. We use an estimate of the
    undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the assets in
    assessing their recoverability. In addition, goodwill is tested
    for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if
    indicators of impairment arise. In testing for goodwill
    impairment, we estimate the fair value of each operating segment
    of our business and compare the fair values with the carrying
    values. When the fair value of an operating segment is greater
    than its carrying value, no impairment results. We measure
    impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of
    the asset or operating segment exceeds its fair value.

Our estimates of future cash flows
    and fair values are based on our judgment. Accordingly, we could
    designate certain assets as impaired that are not and fail to
    identify certain impaired assets.

Income
    Taxes:

We account for income taxes in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
    109, ‘‘Accounting for Income Taxes.” Accordingly,
    deferred taxes have been provided to show the effect of
    temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and
    expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and
    between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
    reported amounts in the financial statements. After the initial
    recognition of a deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is
    provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not
    that the asset will not be realized.

Valuation allowances for deferred
    tax assets and the realizability of net operating losses for tax
    purposes are based upon our judgment. If our judgment and
    estimates concerning valuation allowances and  the realizability
    of net operating losses are incorrect, our provision for income
    taxes would change.

Business
    Combinations

We make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on
    financial and strategic considerations. Businesses acquired are
    accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are
    included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date
    of acquisition.

We acquired various solid waste businesses during the years
    ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The aggregate
    purchase prices we paid for these transactions was
    $26.7 million, $47.4 million and $51.5 million,
    respectively. In addition, during 2005, we entered into a
    $53.9 million capital lease related to a landfill.

We divested of our operations in western New York during the
    three months ended March 31, 2005 and received proceeds of
    $29.1 million. A gain of $3.3 million was recorded on
    the divestiture. In addition, during the three months ended
    December 31, 2005, we sold our environmental remediation
    company and received proceeds of $1.2 million. A loss of
    $2.0 million was recorded on the divestiture.

Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill)
    for 2005 acquisitions totaled $16.6 million. As of
    December 31, 2005 we had goodwill, net of accumulated
    amortization, of $1,563.8 million.

During 2005, $57.9 million of the total purchase price paid
    for acquisitions (including debt acquired) and contingent
    payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. As
    of December 31, 2005, we had $800.7 million of
    landfill development costs, net of accumulated depletion and
    amortization, which includes purchase price allocated to
    landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs.
    When a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets,
    purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the
    discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative
    to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted
    for other landfill assets and liabilities acquired (which are
    primarily for final capping, closure and post-closure
    obligations). Landfill purchase


price is amortized using the

units-of-consumption

method over total available airspace, which includes probable
    expansion airspace where appropriate.

Goodwill for 2004 acquisitions totaled approximately
    $13.2 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had
    goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of
    $1,562.7 million. $28.2 million of the total purchase
    price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former
    owners was allocated to landfill airspace.

Goodwill for 2003 acquisitions totaled approximately
    $21.2 million. As of December 31, 2003, we had
    goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of
    $1,558.1 million. $27.7 million of the total purchase
    price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former
    owners was allocated to landfill airspace.

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Years
    Ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003

Our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting
    principles was $253.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, as compared to $237.9 million in
    2004 and $215.4 million in 2003. Net income was
    $253.7 million for year ended December 31, 2005, or
    $1.75 per diluted share, as compared to
    $237.9 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, in 2004
    and $177.6 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, in
    2003. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2003
    includes an after-tax expense of $37.8 million (net of an
    income tax benefit of $23.1 million), or $.23 per
    share, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
    principle resulting from the adoption of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations,” and a change in accounting
    principle for our methane gas collection systems. See
    Note 1, Basis of Presentation, of the Notes to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
    these changes in accounting principles.

2005:

During the year ended December 31,
    2005, our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit
    from a broad-based pricing initiative which we started during
    the fourth quarter of 2003. We anticipate that we will continue
    to realize this benefit throughout 2006. During the year ended
    December 31, 2005, we experienced core volume growth in our
    residential collection, industrial collection and landfill
    businesses. Our core volume growth was also positively impacted
    by hurricane

clean-up

efforts. In June 2005, we began assessing environmental fees on
    the non-franchise portion of our customer base.

•

2004:

During the year ended December 31,
    2004, our revenue growth from core pricing benefited from a
    broad-based pricing initiative which we started during the
    fourth quarter of 2003. During the year ended December 31,
    2004, we experienced core volume growth in all lines of our
    business, including our residential collection business
    resulting from the addition of several new municipal contracts,
    and our landfill and transfer station businesses resulting from
    newly opened sites and new contracts.

•

2003:

During the first three quarters of 2003,
    we experienced moderate growth in revenue due to an increase in
    core pricing. During the fourth quarter of 2003, our revenue
    growth from core pricing increased at a more rapid pace due to
    our broad-based pricing initiative.

During 2003, the economic slowdown which began during 2001
    continued to negatively impact our business. However, during
    2003, our revenue growth from core volume continued to be
    positively impacted by long-term franchise and municipal
    contracts that were secured during 2002.

•

2006 Outlook:

We anticipate internal growth
    from core operations to be approximately 5.0% during 2006
    assuming no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy
    from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2005.
    However, our price and volume growth may remain flat or may
    decline in 2006 depending upon economic conditions and our
    success in implementing pricing initiatives.

Cost of Operations.

Cost of operations was
    $1,803.9 million, $1,714.4 million and
    $1,605.4 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 63.0%,
    63.3% and 63.8%, for the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2004 and 2003, respectively.

The increase in aggregate dollars in all periods presented is
    primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through
    internal growth.


The following table summarizes the major components of our cost
    of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
    and 2003 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our

A description of our cost categories is as follows:

•

Subcontractor, disposal and third-party fees include costs such
    as third-party disposal, transportation of waste, host fees and
    cost of goods sold. The decrease in such expenses as a
    percentage of revenue from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to
    improved pricing, a change in mix of revenue and continued focus
    on productivity improvements partially offset by higher
    fuel-related subcontracting costs. The increase in such expenses
    as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to
    an increase in the cost of long-haul transport of waste by
    third-party vendors.

•

Labor and benefits include costs such as wages, salaries,
    payroll taxes and health benefits for our frontline service
    employees and their supervisors. The decrease in such expenses
    as a percentage of revenue from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to
    improved pricing, a change in revenue mix and continued focus on
    productivity improvements during the years presented. The
    increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2003
    to 2004 is primarily due to health insurance.

•

Maintenance and operating includes costs such as fuel, parts,
    shop labor and benefits, third-party repairs, and landfill
    monitoring and operating. The increase in such expenses as a
    percentage of revenue for the years presented is primarily due
    to an increase in fuel costs. The cost of fuel as a percentage
    of revenue increased by approximately 1.0% from 2004 to 2005 and
    .7% from 2003 to 2004.

•

Insurance and other includes costs such as worker’s
    compensation, auto and general liability insurance, property
    taxes, property maintenance, and utilities. The decrease in such
    costs as a percentage of revenue for the years presented is
    primarily due to a decrease in risk insurance expense. Risk
    insurance expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by .5%
    from 2004 to 2005 and 1.4% from 2003 to 2004.

The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and
    may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by
    other companies. As such, care should be taken when comparing
    our cost of operations by cost component to those of other
    companies.

Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and
    Equipment.

Depreciation, amortization and
    depletion expenses for property and equipment were
    $271.7 million, $252.4 million and
    $233.8 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 9.5%, 9.3%
    and 9.3%, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
    2003, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars for the
    periods presented is primarily due to the expansion of our
    operations through internal growth and acquisitions. The
    increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the
    year ended December 31, 2005 versus the comparable 2004
    period is due to an increase in depreciation expense associated
    with vehicles and equipment acquired in 2005.

Amortization of Intangible Assets.

Intangible
    assets consist primarily of costs in excess of fair value of net
    assets acquired (goodwill), but also includes values assigned to
    long-term contracts, covenants not to compete and customer
    relationships. Expenses for amortization of intangible assets
    were $7.1 million, $7.0 million and $5.3 million,
    or, as a percentage of revenue, .2%, .3% and .2%, for the years
    ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
    increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a
    percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to
    amortization expense on amounts that were recorded in other
    intangible assets during the three months ended
    September 30, 2004 resulting from an extensive internal
    review of all recent acquisitions. The


increase in amortization of intangible assets in aggregate
    dollars is also due to the amortization of intangible assets
    associated with businesses acquired during 2004.

Accretion Expense.

Accretion expense was
    $14.5 million, $13.7 million and $12.7 million,
    or, as a percentage of revenue, .5% for each of the years ended
    December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005. The increase in such
    expenses in aggregate dollars in 2005 and 2004 is primarily due
    to expansion of our landfill operations.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses were $289.5 million, $268.3 million and
    $247.9 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 10.1%, 9.9%
    and 9.8%, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
    2003, respectively. The increases in aggregate dollars are
    primarily a result of the expansion of our business. The
    increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the
    year ended December 31, 2005 versus the comparable 2004
    period is primarily due to approximately $3.0 million of
    costs incurred during the first quarter of 2005 associated with
    the exchange of unsecured notes. It is also due to a
    $2.1 million non-cash charge incurred during the fourth
    quarter of 2005 related to the acceleration of the vesting of
    all outstanding stock options previously awarded to employees.
    The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from
    2003 to 2004 is primarily due to higher compensation costs.

We believe that selling, general and administrative expenses in
    the range of 10% of revenue are appropriate for 2006 given our
    business platform.

Operating Income.

Operating income was
    $477.2 million, $452.3 million and
    $412.7 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 16.7%,
    16.7% and 16.4%, for the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2004 and 2003, respectively.

Interest Expense.

We incurred interest expense
    primarily on our unsecured notes and tax-exempt bonds. Interest
    expense was $81.0 million, $76.7 million and
    $78.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in interest expense
    from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to an increase in interest
    rates on our floating-rate debt, an increase in debt balances,
    and fees associated with the refinancing of our revolving credit
    facility in 2005. In May 2004, $225.0 million of our public
    notes matured and were repaid resulting in a reduction in
    interest expense, which was partially offset by increases in
    interest expense resulting from additional tax-exempt financing
    obtained during 2004.

Capitalized interest was $2.0 million, $2.1 million
    and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31,
    2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Interest Income and Other Income (Expense),
    Net.

Interest income and other income, net of
    other expense, was $13.0 million, $8.1 million and
    $12.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2004 and 2003, respectively. The variances during the periods
    are primarily due to fluctuations in cash, restricted cash and
    marketable securities balances and net gains on the disposition
    of assets during 2003. The increase in aggregate dollars during
    the year ended December 31, 2005 versus the comparable
    period last year is primarily due to an increase in interest
    income on cash and restricted cash balances resulting from
    higher interest rates. In May 2004, we used a portion of our
    outstanding cash and restricted cash and marketable securities
    balances to repay $225.0 million of public notes.

Income Taxes.

Our provision for income taxes
    was $155.5 million, $145.8 million and
    $132.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2004 and 2003, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was
    38.0% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting
    Principles.

During the first quarter of 2003, we
    adopted SFAS 143. SFAS 143 required us to change the
    methodology we used to record final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs related to our landfills. As of
    January 1, 2003, we recorded an after-tax expense of
    $20.8 million, or $33.6 million on a pre-tax basis, as
    a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
    resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143. In addition, we
    also recorded an after-tax expense of $17.0 million, or
    $27.4 million on a pre-tax basis, as a cumulative effect of
    a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection
    systems. This change in accounting principle for methane gas
    collection systems was prompted by a thorough evaluation of our
    landfill accounting policy in connection with the adoption of
    SFAS 143 and is consistent with the methodology used by
    other participants in the waste industry.

Changes in engineering estimates typically include minor
    modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill
    based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting
    from updated information. Changes in design typically include
    significant modifications to a landfill’s footprint or
    vertical slopes.

At December 31, 2002, 20.7% of our total available
    airspace, or 353.3 million cubic yards, consists of
    probable expansion airspace at twenty of our landfills. At
    December 31, 2005, 10.1% of our total available airspace,
    or 177.7 million cubic yards, consists of probable
    expansion airspace at nine of our landfills. This decrease in
    probable expansion airspace demonstrates our continued success
    in obtaining permits for expansion airspace.

During 2003, total available airspace increased by
    56.1 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken,
    two landfills that were acquired during the year, and changes in
    design partially offset by airspace consumption and changes in
    engineering estimates. During 2004, total available airspace
    decreased by 15.5 million cubic yards primarily due to
    airspace consumption partially offset by the acquisition of a
    landfill. During 2005, total available


airspace increased by 3.6 million cubic yards primarily due
    to new expansions undertaken, the acquisition of a landfill,
    permits granted and changes in engineering estimates partially
    offset by airspace consumed.

As of December 31, 2005, we owned or operated 59 solid
    waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated
    to be 1.8 billion in-place cubic yards. Total available
    disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted
    airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. These
    estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing
    information provided by annual aerial surveys. As of
    December 31, 2005, total available disposal capacity is
    estimated to be 1.6 billion in-place cubic yards of
    permitted airspace plus .2 billion in-place cubic yards of
    probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included in an
    expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace
    and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available
    disposal capacity, it must meet our expansion criteria. See
    Note 3, Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs, of the
    Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    information.

As of December 31, 2005, nine of our landfills meet the
    criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their
    total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes,
    these nine landfills have an estimated remaining average site
    life of 34 years, including probable expansion airspace.
    The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is
    30 years.

The following table reflects the estimated operating lives of
    our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity
    using current annual volumes as of December 31, 2005:

Final
    Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

As of January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations.” This statement required us to
    change the methodology we used to record final capping, closure
    and post-closure costs. See Note 3, Accrued Landfill and
    Environmental Costs, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further information.

As of December 31, 2005, accrued final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs were $239.5 million. The current portion
    of these costs of $27.0 million is reflected in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current liabilities. The
    long-term portion of these costs of $212.5 million is
    reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accrued landfill
    and environmental costs.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    our weighted average compaction rate was approximately 1,500
    pounds per cubic yard.

As of December 31, 2005, we expect to spend an estimated
    additional $1,494.8 million on existing landfills,
    primarily related to cell construction and environmental
    structures, over their expected remaining lives. Our total
    expected investment, excluding non-depletable land, estimated to
    be $2.4 billion, or $1.34 per cubic yard, is used in
    determining our depletion and amortization expense based upon
    airspace consumed using the

units-of-consumption

method.

We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities
    through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. We accrue costs
    related to environmental remediation activities associated with
    properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to
    cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill
    purchase price allocated to airspace, as appropriate. No
    material amounts were charged to expense during the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Financial
    Condition

At December 31, 2005 we had $131.8 million of cash and
    cash equivalents. We also had $255.3 million of restricted
    cash deposits, including $144.9 million of restricted cash
    held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities and
    $25.3 million pledged to various regulatory agencies and
    governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance
    related to final capping, closure and post-closure obligations
    at our landfills.

In June 2005, we entered into a new $750.0 million
    unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which
    expires in 2010. This facility replaced our prior facilities
    which aggregated $750.0 million. Borrowings under the
    credit facility bear interest at LIBOR-based rates. We use our
    operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to
    finance our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
    share repurchases, dividends and other requirements. At
    December 31, 2005, letters of credit outstanding totaling
    $391.2 million were secured by our revolving credit
    facility. As a result, as of December 31, 2005 we had
    $358.8 million available under our credit facility.

In May 1999, we sold $600.0 million of unsecured notes in
    the public market. $225.0 million of these notes bore
    interest at 6.625% per annum and matured in May 2004. The
    remaining $375.0 million bear interest at 7.125% per
    annum and mature in 2009. Interest on these notes is payable
    semi-annually in May and November. The $225.0 million and
    $375.0 million in notes were offered at a discount of
    $1.0 million and $.5 million, respectively. In March
    2005, we exchanged $275.7 million of our outstanding
    7.125% notes due 2009 for new notes due 2035. The new notes
    bear interest at 6.086%. We paid a premium of $27.6 million
    related to the exchange. This premium will be amortized over the
    life of the new notes using the effective yield method.


In August 2001, we sold $450.0 million of unsecured notes
    in the public market. The notes bear interest at 6.75% and
    mature in 2011. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually
    in February and August. The notes were offered at a discount of
    $2.6 million. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay
    our revolving credit facility.

In March 2005, we entered into a $53.9 million capital
    lease related to a landfill.

In order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest
    rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest
    rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with
    investment grade-rated financial institutions. The swap
    agreements have total notional values of $225.0 million and
    $210.0 million, respectively, and require our company to
    pay interest at floating rates based upon changes in LIBOR and
    receive interest at fixed rates of 6.625% and 6.75%,
    respectively. Swap agreements with a notional value of
    $225.0 million matured in May 2004, and agreements with a
    notional value of $210.0 million mature in August 2011.

At December 31, 2005, we had $645.4 million of
    tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings outstanding of
    which approximately $119.5 million were obtained during
    fiscal 2005. Borrowings under these bonds and other financings
    bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the
    prevailing market ranging from 3.25% to 5.63% at
    December 31, 2005 and have maturities ranging from 2006 to
    2037. As of December 31, 2005, we had $144.9 million
    of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax-exempt bonds and
    other tax-exempt financings. This restricted cash will be used
    to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements.

We believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities
    and proceeds from our revolving credit facility provide us with
    sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital
    requirements and obligations as they come due. We believe that
    we will be able to raise additional debt or equity financing, if
    necessary.

Our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of
    revenue for 2003, 2004 and 2005 was .4%, .3% and .2%,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2005, accounts receivable
    were $280.0 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts
    of $17.3 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of 34
    or 22 days net of deferred revenue. In addition, at
    December 31, 2005, our accounts receivable in excess of
    90 days old totaled $16.8 million, or 5.7% of gross
    receivables outstanding.

Our expense for self-insurance as a percentage of revenue for
    2003, 2004 and 2005 was 7.5%, 6.1% and 5.6%, respectively. The
    increase in self-insurance expense during 2003 relative to 2004
    and 2005 related to existing claims and was attributable to the
    expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as
    a result of continued negative trends through our 2003 policy
    year, based on actuarial claims experience, expected claims
    development and medical cost inflation. We believe that during
    2006, our self-insurance expense will be in the range of 5.5% of
    revenue.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The major components of changes in cash flows for the years
    ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are discussed below.

Cash Flows From Operating Activities.

Cash
    provided by operating activities was $767.5 million,
    $666.3 million and $600.5 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The changes
    in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are
    due to the expansion of our business, the timing of payments
    received for accounts receivable, and the timing of payments for
    accounts payable and income taxes.

In December 2003, we received written approval from the Internal
    Revenue Service to exclude probable expansion airspace from our
    calculation of landfill amortization, depletion, and final
    capping, closure and post-closure expense for tax purposes. As a
    result of this change, we recorded a tax receivable of
    approximately $48.0 million which was collected or used to
    offset taxes payable during the year ended December 31,
    2004. Also during the year ended December 31, 2004, we
    collected a $23.0 million note receivable associated with a
    divested business.

Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 was higher than expected because of a
    $113.4 million federal tax payment that was deferred until
    February 2006 as a result of an Internal Revenue


Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina, and the
    timing of payments for capital and other expenditures.

As a result of the timing of these payments, we expect cash
    provided by operating activities during 2006 to be lower than
    2005.

We use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures,
    acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments and debt
    repayments.

Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities.

Cash
    used in investing activities was $297.2 million,
    $206.7 million and $552.4 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and
    consists primarily of cash used for capital additions for all
    periods presented, cash provided by restricted marketable
    securities in 2004 and cash provided by the disposition of our
    operations in western New York in 2005. Capital additions were
    $328.7 million, $283.8 million and $273.2 million
    during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
    respectively. Cash used to acquire businesses, net of cash
    acquired, was $26.7 million, $47.3 million and
    $51.5 million during the years ended December 31,
    2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The increase in restricted marketable securities during 2003
    consists of amounts transferred from unrestricted cash for
    financial guarantees. In 2004, we liquidated a portion of these
    marketable securities and used the proceeds to repay the
    $225.0 million of public notes. We used letters of credit
    to replace financial guarantees secured by marketable securities
    that were liquidated.

We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions
    through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital
    expenditures, cash flow from operations, our revolving credit
    facility, tax-exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to
    use primarily cash for future business acquisitions.

Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities.

Cash
    used in financing activities was $480.0 million,
    $437.3 million and $70.4 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and
    primarily includes proceeds from issuances of tax-exempt bonds,
    repayments of debt, repurchases of common stock under our stock
    repurchase program, proceeds from the issuance of common stock
    primarily related to equity-based compensation and payments of
    cash dividends. Dividends paid were $72.2 million,
    $46.0 million and $19.0 million during 2005, 2004 and
    2003, respectively. In 2004, repayments of debt include the
    liquidation of $225.0 million of public notes.

From 2000 through 2005, our board of directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $1,525.0 million of our common stock.
    As of December 31, 2005, we paid $1,308.8 million to
    repurchase 51.5 million shares of our common stock, of
    which $558.4 million was paid during 2005 to repurchase
    16.3 million shares of our common stock.

We used proceeds from our cash on hand, liquidation of
    marketable securities, cash flow from operations, and tax-exempt
    bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay
    debt. We intend to finance future stock repurchases and dividend
    payments through cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our
    revolving credit facility and other financings.

Credit
    Rating

Our company has received investment grade credit ratings. As of
    December 31, 2005, our senior debt was rated BBB+ by
    Standard & Poor’s, BBB+ by Fitch and Baa2 by
    Moody’s.

Fuel
    Hedge

During March 2005, we entered into option agreements related to
    forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under SFAS 133, the
    options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of
    changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases. These
    option agreements settle each month in equal notional amounts
    through December 2005. In accordance with SFAS 133, the
    ineffective portion of the change in fair value for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 was not material and has been
    included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains of
    $2.5 million related to these option agreements are
    included in cost of operations in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005.


In October 2005, we entered into new option agreements related
    to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. These option agreements
    commence on January  1, 2006 and settle each month in
    equal notional amounts of 500,000 gallons through
    December 31, 2006. In accordance with SFAS 133,
    $.4 million representing the effective portion of the
    change in fair value as of December 31, 2005, net of tax,
    has been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion
    of the change in fair value was not material and has been
    recorded in other income (expense), net in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

The estimated remaining final capping, closure and post-closure
    expenditures presented above are undiscounted and reflect the
    estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded
    as of December 31, 2005.

Unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of
    long-term disposal agreements that require us to dispose of a
    minimum number of tons at third-party facilities.

Off-Balance
    Arrangements

We do not have or engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The table below provides information about our market sensitive
    financial instruments and constitutes a “forward-looking
    statement.” Our major market risk exposure is changing
    interest rates in the United States and fluctuations in LIBOR.
    We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a
    combination of fixed and floating rate debt. All items described
    below are non-trading.

The fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying
    value since interest rates are variable and, thus, approximate
    current market rates.

Free Cash
    Flow

We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in
    accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the
    United States, as cash provided by operating activities less
    purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of
    property and equipment as presented in our Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows. Our free cash flow for the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is calculated as follows
    (in millions):

$

336.4

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
    higher than the previous years presented primarily because of a
    $113.4 million federal tax payment that was deferred until
    February 2006 as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice
    issued in response to Hurricane Katrina, and the timing of
    payments for capital and other expenditures.

As a result of the timing of these payments, we expect free cash
    flow during 2006 to be lower than 2005.

We believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides
    useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by
    operating activities after expenditures for property and
    equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment.
    It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial
    strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets
    to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital
    assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services
    provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our
    existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock
    at prices that provide value to our shareholders, paying cash
    dividends, maintaining our investment grade rating and
    minimizing debt. In addition, free cash flow is a key metric
    used to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash
    flow has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent
    our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because
    it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we
    have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend
    payments. Our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable
    to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Seasonality

Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement
    weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under
    our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation),
    delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of
    waste delivered to our disposal sites, or delay the construction
    or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,”
    which is a revision of SFAS 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation.” SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB
    Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,” and amends SFAS 95, “Statement of
    Cash Flows.” Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is
    similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However,
    SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees,
    including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in
    the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma
    disclosure is no longer an alternative.

We are required to adopt SFAS 123(R) on January 1,
    2006 and expect to use the “modified-prospective”
    method in which compensation cost will be recognized beginning
    with the effective date based on the requirements of
    SFAS 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the
    effective date.


As permitted by SFAS 123, we currently account for
    share-based payments to employees using APB 25’s
    intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no
    compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the
    adoption of SFAS 123(R)’s fair value method may have a
    significant impact on our results of operations, although it
    will have no impact on our overall financial position. The
    impact of adoption of SFAS 123(R) depends on levels of
    share-based payments granted in the future. We estimate that
    adopting SFAS 123(R) will reduce 2006 earnings per share by
    approximately three cents which includes incentive compensation
    granted in lieu of stock options. SFAS 123(R) requires the
    benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
    cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an
    operating cash flow as required under current literature. This
    requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase
    net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While we
    cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future
    (because they depend on, among other things, when employees
    exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows
    recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were
    $29.4 million, $10.6 million, and $6.7 million in
    2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting
    of all outstanding stock options previously awarded to
    employees, effective December 30, 2005. As a result of this
    acceleration, we recorded a non-cash charge of $2.1 million
    during the fourth quarter of 2005. This acceleration was made in
    advance of the effective date of SFAS 123(R) and in
    anticipation of changes to our compensation programs beginning
    in 2006.

There are no other new accounting pronouncements that are
    significant to our company.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Republic Services,
    Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Republic Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Republic Services, Inc. and subsidiaries
    at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2003
    Republic Services, Inc. changed its method of accounting for
    final capping, closure and post-closure costs relating to its
    landfills and for methane gas collection systems.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Republic Services, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
    criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 22, 2006, expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Republic Services,
    Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Report of Management on Republic Services,
    Inc.’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that
    Republic Services, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (the COSO criteria). Republic Services, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
    assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Republic
    Services, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
    Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of Republic Services, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2005 of Republic Services, Inc. and our report
    dated February 22, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All

1.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the
    accounts of Republic Services, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and
    its subsidiaries (the “Company”). The Company is a
    leading provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection and
    disposal services in the United States. All intercompany
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

As of January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting
    for Asset Retirement Obligations”
    (“SFAS 143”). SFAS 143 required the Company
    to change the methodology it used to record final capping,
    closure and post-closure costs relating to its landfills. As of
    January 1, 2003, the Company recorded an after-tax expense
    of $20.8 million, or $33.6 million on a pre-tax basis,
    as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
    resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143. In addition, the
    Company also recorded an after-tax expense of
    $17.0 million, or $27.4 million on a pre-tax basis, as
    a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for its
    methane gas collection systems. This change in accounting for
    methane gas collection systems was prompted by a thorough
    evaluation of the Company’s landfill accounting policies in
    connection with the adoption of SFAS 143 and is consistent
    with the methodology used by other participants in the waste
    industry.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
    Interpretation 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities” (“FIN 46”). FIN 46 introduced
    a new consolidation model which determines control and
    consolidation based upon the primary beneficiary of the
    potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being
    evaluated. This interpretation was effective for all variable
    interest entities beginning March 31, 2004. The Company
    evaluated its organizational structure and concluded that
    FIN 46 has no impact on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

2.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of
    Estimates

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles and necessarily include amounts based on estimates
    and assumptions made by management. Actual results could differ
    from these amounts. Significant items subject to such estimates
    and assumptions include the depletion and amortization of
    landfill development costs, liabilities for final capping,
    closure and post-closure costs, valuation allowances for
    accounts receivable, liabilities for potential litigation,
    claims and assessments, and liabilities for environmental
    remediation, deferred taxes and self-insurance.

Accounts
    Receivable

Accounts receivable represent receivables from customers for
    collection, transfer, disposal and other services. Receivables
    are recorded when billed. Accounts receivable, net of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts, represents their estimated net
    realizable value. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded
    based on historical collection experience, the age of the
    receivables, specific customer information and economic
    conditions. In general, reserves are provided for accounts
    receivable in excess of ninety days old. Accounts receivable are
    written off when they are deemed uncollectible.

Inventories consist primarily of compost, mulch, and soil
    materials, equipment parts and fuel that are valued under a
    method that approximates the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out) or market.

The Company expenses advertising expenditures as incurred.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for
    major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized,
    while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
    incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the
    related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
    accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company revises the estimated useful lives of property and
    equipment acquired through business acquisitions to conform with
    its policies regarding property and equipment. Depreciation is
    provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets involved
    using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives are
    seven to forty years for buildings and improvements, five to
    twelve years for vehicles, seven to ten years for most landfill
    equipment, three to fifteen years for all other equipment, and
    five to twelve years for furniture and fixtures.

Landfills and landfill improvements are stated at cost and are
    amortized or depleted based on consumed airspace. Landfill
    improvements include direct costs incurred to obtain landfill
    permits and direct costs incurred to acquire, construct and
    develop sites. These costs are amortized or depleted based on
    consumed airspace. All indirect landfill development costs are
    expensed as incurred. (For further information, see Note 3,
    Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs.)

The Company capitalizes interest on landfill cell construction
    and other construction projects in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, “Capitalization
    of Interest Cost.” Construction projects must meet the
    following criteria before interest is capitalized:

1. Total construction costs are $50,000 or greater,

2. The construction phase is one month or longer, and

3. The assets have a useful life of one year or longer.

Interest is capitalized on qualified assets while they undergo
    activities to ready them for their intended use. Capitalization
    of interest ceases once an asset is placed into service or if
    construction activity is suspended for more than a brief period
    of time. The interest capitalization rate is based upon the
    Company’s weighted average cost of indebtedness. Interest
    capitalized was $2.0 million, $2.1 million and
    $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company periodically evaluates whether events and
    circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the
    estimated useful life of property and equipment or whether the
    remaining balance of property and equipment should be evaluated
    for possible impairment. The following are examples of such
    events or changes in circumstances:

•

A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset
    or asset group,

•

A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a
    long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical
    condition,

•

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
    climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset or
    asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a
    regulator,

•

An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
    originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a
    long-lived asset or asset group,

•

A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a
    history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or
    forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the
    use of a long-lived asset or asset group, or

•

A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived
    asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of
    significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
    life.

There are certain indicators listed above that require
    significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry
    when applied to landfill development or expansion. For example,
    a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit
    application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted.
    In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one
    landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill
    airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary
    course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators
    of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry.

The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash
    flows over the remaining life of the property and equipment in
    assessing their recoverability. The Company measures impairment
    loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
    exceeds the fair value of the asset.

Intangible
    Assets

Intangible assets consist of the cost of acquired businesses in
    excess of the fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) and
    other intangible assets. Other intangible assets include values
    assigned to customer relationships, long-term contracts and
    covenants not to compete and are amortized generally over
    periods ranging from 3 to 25 years.

Goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis.
    In testing for impairment, the Company estimates the fair value
    of each operating segment and compares the fair values with the
    carrying values. If the fair value of an operating segment is
    greater than its carrying value, then no impairment results. If
    the fair value is less than its


REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All
    tables in millions, except per share
    data) — (Continued)

carrying value, then the Company would determine the fair value
    of the goodwill. The fair value of goodwill is determined by
    deducting the fair value of an operating segment’s
    identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the
    operating segment as a whole, as if that operating segment had
    just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially
    allocated. If the fair value of the goodwill were less than its
    carrying value for a segment, an impairment charge would be
    recorded to earnings in the Company’s Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

In addition, the Company would evaluate an operating segment for
    impairment if events or circumstances change between annual
    tests indicating a possible impairment. Examples of such events
    or circumstances include:

•

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
    climate,

•

An adverse action or assessment by a regulator,

•

A more likely than not expectation that a segment or a
    significant portion thereof will be sold, or

•

The testing for recoverability under Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,” of a significant asset
    group within the segment.

The Company incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result of
    its goodwill impairment test in 2005. However, there can be no
    assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the
    future.

Stock
    Options

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation using the
    intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” (“APB 25”), and related
    interpretations. In general, no stock-based employee
    compensation cost is reflected in net income for stock option
    grants, as all options granted under the 1998 Stock Incentive
    Plan for the periods presented had an exercise price equal to
    the market value of the underlying common stock at the date of
    grant. Compensation expense resulting from grants of restricted
    stock or stock units is calculated in accordance with
    APB 25 based on the market value of the underlying shares
    as of the grant date and is amortized ratably over the vesting
    period. Had compensation cost for stock option, restricted stock
    and stock unit grants under the Company’s 1998 Stock
    Incentive Plan been determined pursuant to Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”),
    the Company’s net income would have decreased accordingly.
    Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the Company’s
    pro forma net income, earnings per share and weighted-average
    fair value of options, restricted stock and stock units granted
    during the period, with related assumptions, are as follows:

The increase in pro-forma stock-based employee compensation
    expense pursuant to SFAS 123 during 2005 compared to the
    other periods presented is due to the acceleration of the
    vesting of all outstanding stock options previously awarded to
    employees as approved by the Company’s Board of Directors
    effective December 30, 2005. As a result of this
    acceleration, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of
    $2.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2005. This
    acceleration was made in advance of the effective date of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payments.” The Company expects to reduce
    the pre-tax stock option expense it would

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All
    tables in millions, except per share

otherwise be required to record under SFAS 123(R) for these
    stock options by an estimated $7 million, $3 million
    and $1 million in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.

Revenue
    Recognition and Deferred Revenue

The Company generally provides services under contracts with
    municipalities or individual customers. Revenue consists
    primarily of collection fees from commercial, industrial,
    residential and municipal customers and transfer and landfill
    disposal fees charged to third parties. Advance billings are
    recorded as deferred revenue, and the revenue is then recognized
    over the period services are provided. Collection, transfer and
    disposal, and other services accounted for 74.7%, 19.1% and
    6.2%, respectively, of consolidated revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. No one customer has individually
    accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated
    revenue or of the Company’s reportable segment revenue in
    any of the past three years.

The Company recognizes revenue when all four of the following
    criteria are met:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists such as a service
    agreement with a municipality, a hauling customer or a disposal
    customer,

•

Services have been performed such as the collection and hauling
    of waste or the disposal of waste at a Company-owned disposal
    facility,

•

The price of the services provided to the customer are fixed or
    determinable, and

•

Collectability is reasonably assured.

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Accordingly, deferred
    income taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary
    differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for
    financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax
    bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in
    the financial statements.

Statements
    of Cash Flows

The Company considers all unrestricted highly liquid investments
    with purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents. The effect of non-cash transactions related to
    business combinations, as discussed in Note  4,
    Business Combinations, and other non-cash transactions are
    excluded from the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted
    cash and marketable securities, receivables, accounts payable
    and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short
    maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the
    Company’s fixed rate unsecured notes and tax-exempt
    financing using quoted market rates is $1,134.1 million at
    December 31, 2005. The carrying value of the fixed rate
    unsecured notes and tax-exempt financing is
    $1,092.5 million at December 31, 2005. The carrying
    amounts of the Company’s remaining notes payable and
    tax-exempt financing approximate fair value because interest
    rates are variable and, accordingly, approximate current market
    rates.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company provides services to commercial, industrial,
    municipal and residential customers in the United States.
    Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables
    are limited due to the wide variety


REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All
    tables in millions, except per share
    data) — (Continued)

of customers and markets in which services are provided as well
    as their dispersion across many geographic areas in the
    United States. The Company performs ongoing credit
    evaluations of its customers, but does not require collateral to
    support customer receivables. The Company establishes an
    allowance for doubtful accounts based on various factors
    including the credit risk of specific customers, age of
    receivables outstanding, historical trends, economic conditions
    and other information.

New
    Accounting Pronouncement

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123(R)”), which is a revision of Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).
    SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and amends
    SFAS 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” Generally,
    the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach
    described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123(R) requires
    all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
    employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement
    based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an
    alternative.

The Company is required to adopt SFAS 123(R) on
    January 1, 2006 and expects to use the
    “modified-prospective” method in which compensation
    cost will be recognized beginning with the effective date based
    on the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share-based
    payments granted after the effective date.

As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company currently accounts
    for share-based payments to employees using APB 25’s
    intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no
    compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the
    adoption of SFAS 123(R)’s fair value method may have a
    significant impact on its results of operations, although it
    will have no impact on its overall financial position. The
    impact of adoption of SFAS 123(R) depends on levels of
    share-based payments granted in the future. The Company
    estimates that adopting SFAS 123(R) will reduce 2006
    earnings per share by approximately three cents which includes
    incentive compensation granted in lieu of stock options.
    SFAS 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in
    excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a
    financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
    required under current literature. This requirement will reduce
    net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows
    in periods after adoption. While the Company cannot estimate
    what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend
    on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options),
    the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods
    for such excess tax deductions were $29.4 million,
    $10.6 million, and $6.7 million in 2005, 2004 and
    2003, respectively.

The Company’s Board of Directors approved the acceleration
    of the vesting of all outstanding stock options previously
    awarded to employees, effective December 30, 2005. As a
    result of this acceleration, the Company recorded a non-cash
    charge of $2.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2005.
    This acceleration was made in advance of the effective date of
    SFAS 123(R) and in anticipation of changes to the
    Company’s compensation programs beginning in 2006.

Related
    Party Transactions

It is the Company’s policy that transactions with related
    parties must be on terms that, on the whole, are no less
    favorable than those that would be available from unaffiliated
    parties.

Life
    Cycle Accounting

The Company uses life cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the
    site. In life cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and
    construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based
    upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. Costs
    and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers. These estimates are used by the Company’s
    operating and accounting personnel to adjust the Company’s
    rates used to expense capitalized costs. Changes in these
    estimates primarily relate to changes in available airspace,
    inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available
    airspace include changes due to the addition of airspace lying
    in probable expansion areas.

Total
    Available Disposal Capacity

As of December 31, 2005, the Company owned or operated 59
    solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity of
    approximately 1.8 billion in-place cubic yards. Total
    available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated
    permitted airspace plus an estimate of expansion airspace that
    the Company believes has a probable likelihood of being
    permitted.

Probable
    Expansion Airspace

Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined as
    probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in the
    Company’s calculation of total available disposal capacity,
    the following criteria must be met:

1.

The land associated with the expansion airspace is either owned
    by the Company or is controlled by the Company pursuant to an
    option agreement;

2.

The Company is committed to supporting the expansion project
    financially and with appropriate resources;

3.

There are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated
    with the project, including political impediments;

4.

Progress is being made on the project;

5.

The expansion is attainable within a reasonable time
    frame; and

6.

The Company believes it is likely the expansion permit will be
    received.


REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All
    tables in millions, except per share
    data) — (Continued)

Upon meeting the Company’s expansion criteria, the rates
    used at each applicable landfill to expense costs to acquire,
    construct, cap, close and maintain a site during the
    post-closure period are adjusted to include probable expansion
    airspace and all additional costs to be capitalized or accrued
    associated with the expansion airspace.

The Company has identified three steps that landfills generally
    follow to obtain expansion permits. These steps are as follows:

1. Obtaining approval from local authorities;

2. Submitting a permit application to state
    authorities; and

3. Obtaining permit approval from state authorities.

Once a landfill meets the Company’s expansion criteria,
    management continuously monitors each site’s progress in
    obtaining the expansion permit. If at any point it is determined
    that an expansion area no longer meets the required criteria,
    the probable expansion airspace is removed from the
    landfill’s total available capacity and the rates used at
    the landfill to expense costs to acquire, construct, cap, close
    and maintain a site during the post-closure period are adjusted
    accordingly.

Capitalized
    Landfill Costs

Capitalized landfill costs include expenditures for land,
    permitting costs, cell construction costs and environmental
    structures. Capitalized permitting and cell construction costs
    are limited to direct costs relating to these activities,
    including legal, engineering and construction costs associated
    with excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of
    leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas
    collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater
    monitoring wells and other costs associated with the development
    of the site. Interest is capitalized on landfill construction
    projects while the assets are undergoing activities to ready
    them for their intended use. Capitalized landfill costs also
    include final capping, closure and post-closure assets accrued
    in accordance with SFAS 143 as discussed below.

Costs related to acquiring land, excluding the estimated
    residual value of unpermitted, non-buffer land, and costs
    related to permitting and cell construction are depleted as
    airspace is consumed using the

units-of-consumption

method.

Capitalized landfill costs may also include an allocation of
    purchase price paid for landfills. For landfills purchased as
    part of a group of several assets, the purchase price assigned
    to the landfill is determined based upon the discounted expected
    future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets
    within the acquired group. If the landfill meets the
    Company’s expansion criteria, the purchase price is further
    allocated between permitted airspace and expansion airspace
    based upon the ratio of permitted versus probable expansion
    airspace to total available airspace. Landfill purchase price is
    amortized using the

units-of-consumption

method over the total available airspace including probable
    expansion airspace where appropriate.

Final
    Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

On January 1, 2003, the Company changed the methodology it
    used to record final capping, closure and

post-closure

expense in accordance with SFAS 143. SFAS 143 does not
    change the basic landfill accounting policies followed by the
    Company and others in the waste industry. Through
    December 31, 2002, the industry has generally amortized
    capitalized costs and accrued future final capping, closure and
    post-closure obligations using the

units-of-consumption

method as cubic yards of available airspace are consumed over
    the life of the related landfill. This practice is referred to

Historical Practice

(Effective January 1,
    2003)

DEFINITIONS:

Final Capping

Costs related to installation of
    the components that comprise the permanent final cover over
    areas of a landfill where airspace capacity has been consumed.

No change.

Closure

Includes routine maintenance costs
    incurred after a site ceases to accept waste, but prior to being
    certified closed.

No change, except that it includes
    the final portion of the methane gas collection system to be
    constructed.

Post-Closure

Includes routine monitoring and
    maintenance of a landfill after it has been certified as closed
    by the applicable state regulatory agency.

No change, except it includes
    methane gas collection systems in all cases where the need for
    such systems are considered probable.

DISCOUNT RATE

Not applicable.

Credit-adjusted, risk-free rate of
    6.10% and 6.50% for the years ending December 31, 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

INFLATION:

Not applicable.

Inflation rate of 2.5%.

COST ESTIMATES:

Cost estimates generally assume
    work will be performed by third parties.

No change, except that the cost of
    any activities performed internally is increased to represent an
    estimate of the amount a third party would charge to perform
    such activity. This third-party profit is taken in to income in
    the period the work is performed internally.

METHANE GAS COLLECTION SYSTEMS:

Capitalized when constructed and
    charged to expense through depreciation over the shorter of
    their useful life or the life of the landfill.

During the active life of a
    landfill, included in cell development costs when the need for
    such systems is considered probable; charged to expense through
    depletion as airspace is consumed using the

units-of-consumption

method. Systems associated with the last final capping event at
    a landfill are included in closure costs.

Historical Practice

(Effective January 1, 2003)

RECOGNITION OF LIABILITY:

Final Capping

Accrued over the life of the
    landfill. Costs are charged to cost of operations and accrued
    liabilities as airspace is consumed using the

units-of-consumption

method. Costs are not discounted.

All final capping costs are
    recorded as a liability and asset at fair value as the
    obligation is incurred. The discounted cash flow associated with
    each final capping event is recorded to an accrued liability,
    with a corresponding increase to landfill assets as airspace is
    consumed related to the specific final capping event. Interest
    is accreted on the liability using the effective interest method
    until the liability is paid.

STATEMENT OF INCOME:

Cost of Operations

Expense charged to cost of
    operations equal to amount of liability accrued.

Not applicable.

Landfill Asset Amortization

Not applicable.

The landfill asset is amortized as
    airspace is consumed over the life of a specific capping event
    for final capping or the life of a landfill for closure and
    post-closure.

Accretion

Not applicable.

Expense recognized as a component
    of operating expenses at credit-adjusted, risk-free rate using
    the effective interest method.

The Company has future obligations for final capping, closure
    and post-closure costs with respect to the landfills it owns or
    operates as set forth in applicable landfill permits. Final
    capping, closure and post-closure costs include estimated costs
    to be incurred for final capping and closure of landfills and
    estimated costs for providing required post-closure monitoring
    and maintenance of landfills. The permit requirements are based
    on the Subtitle C and Subtitle D regulations of the Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as implemented and applied
    on a

state-by-state

basis. Obligations associated with monitoring and controlling
    methane gas migration and emissions are set forth in applicable
    landfill permits and these requirements are based upon the
    provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended. Final
    capping typically includes installing flexible membrane and
    geosynthetic clay liners, drainage and compact soil layers, and
    topsoil, and is constructed over an area of the landfill where
    total airspace capacity has been consumed and waste disposal
    operations have ceased. These final capping activities occur
    throughout the operating life of a landfill. Other closure
    activities and post-closure activities occur after the entire
    landfill ceases to accept waste and closes. These activities
    involve methane gas control, leachate management and


REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All
    tables in millions, except per share
    data) — (Continued)

groundwater monitoring, surface water monitoring and control,
    and other operational and maintenance activities that occur
    after the site ceases to accept waste. The post-closure period
    generally runs for up to 30 years after final site closure
    for municipal solid waste landfills and a shorter period for
    construction and demolition landfills and inert landfills.

Estimates of future expenditures for final capping, closure and
    post-closure are developed by engineers. These estimates are
    reviewed by management at least annually and are used by the
    Company’s operating and accounting personnel to adjust the
    rates used to capitalize and amortize these costs. These
    estimates involve projections of costs that will be incurred
    during the remaining life of the landfill for final capping
    activities, after the landfill ceases operations and during the
    legally required post-closure monitoring period. Additionally,
    the Company currently retains post-closure responsibility for
    several closed landfills.

Under SFAS 143, a liability for an asset retirement
    obligation must be recognized in the period in which it is
    incurred and should be initially measured at fair value. Absent
    quoted market prices, the estimate of fair value should be based
    on the best available information, including the results of
    present value techniques in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Concepts No. 7, “Using Cash Flow
    and Present Value in Accounting Measurements” (“SFAC
    7”). The offset to the liability must be capitalized as
    part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.
    Changes in the liability due to the passage of time are
    recognized as operating items in the income statement and are
    referred to as accretion expense. Changes in the liability due
    to revisions to estimated future cash flows are recognized by
    increasing or decreasing the liability with the offset adjusting
    the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.

In applying the provisions of SFAS 143, the Company has
    concluded that a landfill’s asset retirement obligation
    includes estimates of all costs related to final capping,
    closure and post-closure. Costs associated with a
    landfill’s daily maintenance activities during the
    operating life of the landfill, such as leachate disposal,
    groundwater and gas monitoring, and other pollution control
    activities, are charged to expense as incurred. In addition,
    costs historically accounted for as capital expenditures during
    the operating life of a landfill, such as cell development
    costs, are capitalized when incurred, and charged to expense
    using life cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method based on the consumption of cubic yards of available
    airspace.

The Company defines final capping as activities required to
    permanently cover a portion of a landfill that has been
    completely filled with waste. Final capping occurs in phases
    throughout the life of a landfill as specific areas are filled
    to capacity and the final elevation for that specific area is
    reached in accordance with the provisions of the operating
    permit. The Company considers final capping events to be
    discrete activities that are recognized as asset retirement
    obligations separately from other closure and post-closure
    obligations. These capping events occur generally during the
    operating life of a landfill and can be associated with waste
    actually placed under an area to be capped. As a result, the
    Company uses a separate rate per ton for recognizing the
    principal amount of the liability and related asset associated
    with each capping event. The Company amortizes the asset
    recorded pursuant to this approach as waste volume equivalent to
    the capacity covered by the capping event is placed into the
    landfill based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available
    airspace covered by the capping event.

The Company recognizes asset retirement obligations and the
    related amortization expense for closure and post-closure
    (excluding obligations for final capping) using the

units-of-consumption

method over the total remaining capacity of the landfill. The
    total remaining capacity includes probable expansion airspace.

In general, the Company engages third parties to perform most of
    its final capping, closure and post-closure activities.
    Accordingly, the fair market value of these obligations is based
    upon quoted and actual prices paid for similar work. The Company
    does intend to perform some of its final capping, closure and
    post-closure obligations using internal resources. Where
    internal resources are expected to be used to fulfill an asset
    retirement obligation, the Company has added a profit margin
    onto the estimated cost of such services to better reflect their
    fair market value as required by SFAS 143. These services
    primarily relate to managing construction activities during
    final


REPUBLIC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All
    tables in millions, except per share
    data) — (Continued)

capping, and maintenance activities during closure and
    post-closure. If the Company does perform these services
    internally, the added profit margin would be recognized as a
    component of operating income in the period the obligation is
    settled.

SFAC 7 states that an estimate of fair value should include
    the price that marketplace participants are able to receive for
    bearing the uncertainties in cash flows. However, when utilizing
    discounted cash flow techniques, reliable estimates of market
    premiums may not be obtainable. In this situation, SFAC 7
    indicates that it is not necessary to consider a market risk
    premium in the determination of expected cash flows. While the
    cost of asset retirement obligations associated with final
    capping, closure and post-closure can be quantified and
    estimated, there is not an active market that can be utilized to
    determine the fair value of these activities. In the case of the
    waste industry, no market exists for selling the responsibility
    for final capping, closure and post-closure independent of
    selling the landfill in its entirety. Accordingly, the Company
    believes that it is not possible to develop a methodology to
    reliably estimate a market risk premium and has excluded a
    market risk premium from its determination of expected cash flow
    for landfill asset retirement obligations in accordance with
    SFAC 7.

The Company’s estimates of costs to discharge asset
    retirement obligations for landfills are developed in
    today’s dollars. These costs are inflated each year to
    reflect a normal escalation of prices up to the year they are
    expected to be paid. The Company uses a 2.5% inflation rate,
    which is based upon the ten-year historical moving average
    increase of the U.S. Consumer Price Index and is the rate
    used by most waste industry participants.

These estimated costs are then discounted to their present value
    using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. The Company’s
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate for liability recognition was
    determined to be 6.10% and 6.50% for years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, based upon the
    estimated all-in yield the Company believes it would need to
    offer to sell thirty-year debt in the public market. Changes in
    asset retirement obligations due to the passage of time are
    measured by recognizing accretion expense in a manner that
    results in a constant effective interest rate being applied to
    the average carrying amount of the liability. The effective
    interest rate used to calculate accretion expense is the
    Company’s credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect at the
    time the liabilities were recorded.

In accordance with SFAS 143, changes due to revision of the
    estimates of the amount or timing of the original undiscounted
    cash flows used to record a liability are recognized by
    increasing or decreasing the carrying amount of the asset
    retirement obligation liability and the carrying amount of the
    related asset. Upward revisions in the amount of undiscounted
    estimated cash flows used to record a liability must be
    discounted using the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect
    at the time of the change. Downward revisions in the amount of
    undiscounted estimated cash flows used to record a liability
    must be discounted using the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate
    that existed when the original liability was recognized.

The Company reviews its calculations with respect to landfill
    asset retirement obligations at least annually. If there is a
    significant change in the facts and circumstances related to a
    landfill during the year, the Company will review its
    calculations for the landfill as soon as practical after the
    significant change has occurred. During the three months ended
    March 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company completed its annual
    reviews and recorded reductions of $5.9 million and
    $3.2 million, respectively, in amortization expense
    primarily related to changes in estimates and assumptions
    concerning the cost and timing of future final capping, closure
    and post-closure activities. During the three months ended
    December 31, 2005, the Company completed its annual review
    of landfill asset retirements obligations for 2005 and recorded
    a $2.1 million increase in amortization expense primarily
    related to increases in costs for items such as excavation,
    construction and synthetic liner. The Company intends to conduct
    future annual reviews of its landfill asset retirement
    obligations during the fourth quarter of each year.

Remediation

The Company accrues for remediation costs when they become
    probable and reasonably estimatable. Substantially all of the
    Company’s recorded remediation costs are for incremental
    landfill post-closure care required under approved remediation
    action plans for acquired landfills. Remediation costs are
    estimated by engineers. These estimates do not take into account
    discounts for the present value of total estimated costs.
    Management believes that the amounts accrued for remediation
    costs are adequate. However, a significant increase in the
    estimated costs for remediation could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Environmental
    Operating Costs

In the normal course of business, the Company incurs various
    operating costs associated with environmental compliance. These
    costs include, among other things, leachate treatment and
    disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and systems
    maintenance, interim cap maintenance, costs associated with the
    application of daily cover materials, and the legal and
    administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance.

Environmental
    Claims, Litigation and Assessments

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to
    ongoing environmental investigations by certain regulatory
    agencies, as well as other claims and disputes that could result
    in litigation. Expenses for environmental claims, litigation and
    assessments are accrued by the Company through a charge to
    income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be
    reasonably estimated. No significant amounts were charged to
    expense during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 or
    2003.

BUSINESS
    COMBINATIONS

The Company acquires businesses as part of its growth strategy.
    Businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method
    of accounting and are included in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates
    the cost of the acquired business to the assets acquired and the
    liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair values thereof.
    These estimates are revised during the allocation period as
    necessary if, and when, information regarding contingencies
    becomes available to further define and quantify assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed. To the extent contingencies such as
    preacquisition environmental matters, litigation and related
    legal fees are resolved or settled during the allocation period,
    such items are included in the revised allocation of the
    purchase price. After the allocation period, the effect of
    changes in such contingencies is included in results of
    operations in the periods in which the adjustments are
    determined. The Company does not believe potential differences
    between its fair value estimates and actual fair values are
    material.

The Company acquired various solid waste businesses during the
    years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The aggregate
    purchase price paid for these transactions was
    $26.7 million, $47.4 million and $51.5 million,
    respectively.

In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2005, the
    Company entered into a $53.9 million capital lease related
    to a landfill.

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, $57.9 million,
    $28.2 million and $27.7 million, respectively, of the
    total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent
    payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace.
    For landfills purchased as part of a group of several assets,
    the allocations of purchase price were based on the discounted

expected future cash flow of each landfill relative to other
    assets within the acquired group and were adjusted for other
    landfill assets and liabilities acquired (primarily final
    capping, closure and post-closure obligations). Landfill

facility requires the Company to maintain certain financial
    ratios and comply with certain financial covenants. The Company
    has the ability under its loan covenants to pay dividends and
    repurchase its common stock under the condition that it is in
    compliance with the covenants. At December 31, 2005, the
    Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under
    these agreements.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had
    $255.3 million of restricted cash, of which
    $144.9 million were proceeds from the issuance of
    tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financing and will be used
    to fund capital expenditures. Restricted cash also includes

    2004 and 2003, respectively.

During March 2005, the Company exchanged $275.7 million of
    its outstanding 7.125% notes due 2009 for new notes due
    2035. The new notes bear interest at 6.086%. The Company paid a
    premium of $27.6 million in connection with the exchange.
    This premium will be amortized over the life of the new notes
    using the effective yield method.

Other debt includes a $37.0 million capital lease liability
    as of December 31, 2005 related to a landfill that the
    Company began operating in May 2005.

The Company’s ability to obtain financing through the
    capital markets is a key component of its financial strategy.
    Historically, the Company has managed risk associated with
    executing this strategy, particularly as it relates to
    fluctuations in interest rates, by using a combination of fixed
    and floating rate debt. The Company also entered into interest
    rate swap agreements to manage risk associated with fluctuations
    in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating
    interest rates. The swap agreements have total notional values
    of $225.0 million and $210.0 million. Swap agreements
    with a notional value of $225.0 million matured in May
    2004, and agreements with a notional value of
    $210.0 million mature in August 2011. These maturities are
    identical to the Company’s public notes that were sold in
    1999 and 2001, respectively. Under the swap agreements, the
    Company pays interest at floating rates based on changes in
    LIBOR and receives interest at fixed rates of 6.625% and 6.75%,
    respectively. The Company has designated these agreements as
    hedges in changes in the fair value of the Company’s
    fixed-rate debt and accounts for them in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities” (“SFAS 133”). The Company has
    determined that these agreements qualify for the short-cut
    method under SFAS 133 and, therefore, changes in the fair
    value of the agreements are assumed to be perfectly effective in
    hedging changes in the fair value of the Company’s fixed
    rate debt due to changes in interest rates.

As of December 31, 2005, interest rate swap agreements are
    reflected at fair market value of $5.5 million and are
    included in other liabilities and as an adjustment to long-term
    debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the
    years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company
    recorded net interest income of $1.1 million,
    $7.2 million and $10.0 million, respectively, related
    to its interest rate swap agreements which is included in
    interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
    Income.

In December 2003, the Company received written approval from the
    Internal Revenue Service to exclude probable expansion airspace
    from its calculation of landfill amortization, depletion, and
    final capping, closure and post-closure expenses for tax
    purposes. As a result of this change, the Company’s
    deferred income tax provision increased by approximately
    $82.0 million during 2003, and the Company recorded a tax
    receivable of approximately $48.0 million which was
    collected or used to offset taxes payable during the year ended
    December 31, 2004.

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the

management considers whether it is more likely than not that
    some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized after the initial recognition of the deferred tax
    asset. The Company provides valuation allowances to offset
    portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding
    the future realization of such deferred tax assets. The Company
    adjusts the valuation allowance, if any, in the period
    management determines it is more likely than not that deferred
    tax assets will or will not be realized.

The Company made income tax payments (net of refunds received)
    of approximately $9.3 million, $12.9 million and
    $17.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005, $113.4 million of
    federal tax payments were deferred until February 2006 as a
    result of an Internal Revenue Service notice issued in response
    to Hurricane Katrina.

The Internal Revenue Service is auditing the Company’s
    consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2004.
    Management believes that the tax liabilities recorded are
    adequate. However, a significant assessment in excess of
    liabilities recorded against the Company could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

7.

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

During 2000 through 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $1,525.0 million of the Company’s
    common stock. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had paid
    $1,308.8 million to repurchase 51.5 million shares of
    its common stock, of which 16.3 million shares were
    acquired during the year ended December 31, 2005 for
    $558.4 million.

In July 2003, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
    initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $.06 per share. The
    dividend was increased to $.12 per share in the third
    quarter of 2004 and to $.14 per share in the third quarter
    of 2005. Dividends declared were $73.5 million,
    $54.6 million and $19.0 million during 2005, 2004 and
    2003, respectively. In October 2005, the Company paid a dividend
    of $19.6 million to stockholders of record as of
    October 3, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the Company
    recorded a dividend payable of approximately $19.4 million
    to shareholders of record at the close of business on
    January 2, 2006.

8.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

In July 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan
    (“Stock Incentive Plan”) to provide for grants of
    options to purchase shares of common stock, restricted stock and
    other equity-based compensation to employees and non-employee
    directors of the Company who are eligible to participate in the
    Stock Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2005, there were
    4.4 million stock options reserved for future grants under
    the Stock Incentive Plan.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance
    with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
    (“APB 25”), and related interpretations. Stock
    options are granted at prices equal to the fair market value of
    the Company’s common stock on the date of grant; therefore,
    no compensation expense is recognized. Compensation expense
    resulting from grants of restricted stock or stock units is
    recognized during the vesting period.

Options granted under the Stock Incentive Plan are non-qualified
    and are granted at a price equal to the fair market value of the
    Company’s common stock at the date of grant. Generally,
    options granted have a term of ten years from the date of grant,
    and vest in increments of 25% per year over a four year
    period beginning on the first anniversary date of the grant.
    Options granted to non-employee directors have a term of ten
    years and are fully vested at the date of grant.

The Company’s Board of Directors approved the acceleration
    of the vesting of all outstanding stock options previously
    awarded to employees, effective December 30, 2005. As a
    result of this acceleration, the Company recorded a non-cash
    charge of $2.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2005.
    This acceleration was made in advance of the effective date of
    SFAS 123(R) and in anticipation of changes to the
    Company’s compensation programs beginning in 2006.

During the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, the
    Company awarded 24,000 and 20,000, respectively, deferred stock
    units to its non-employee directors under its Stock Incentive
    Plan. The Company also awarded 5,000 deferred stock units to a
    new non-employee director during the three months ended
    December 31, 2004. These stock units vest immediately but
    the directors receive the underlying shares only after their
    board service ends. The stock units do not carry any voting or
    dividend rights, except the right to receive additional stock
    units in lieu of dividends.

Also during the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004,
    the Company awarded 82,000 and 79,500 of restricted stock,
    respectively, to its executive officers. 10,000 of the shares
    awarded during 2005 vest effective January 1, 2006 and
    43,500 of the shares awarded during 2004 vested during the three
    months ended March 31, 2005. The remaining
    36,000 shares awarded during 2004 vest in two equal annual
    installments beginning on the anniversary date of the original
    grant except that vesting may be accelerated if certain
    performance targets are achieved. The remaining
    72,000 shares awarded during 2005 vest in four equal annual
    installments beginning on the anniversary date of the original
    grant except that vesting may be accelerated if certain
    performance targets are achieved. During the vesting period, the
    participants have voting rights and receive dividends declared
    and paid on the shares, but the shares may not be sold,
    assigned, transferred or otherwise encumbered. Additionally,
    granted but unvested shares are forfeited in the event the
    participant resigns employment with the Company for other than
    good reason.

The fair value of stock units and restricted shares on the date
    of grant is amortized ratably over the vesting period, or the
    accelerated vesting period if certain performance targets are
    achieved. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and
    2004, compensation expense related to stock units and restricted
    shares of $3.1 million and

    Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.
    $1.1 million, representing the unamortized balance of
    unearned compensation on restricted stock, is included as a
    separate component of stockholders’ equity in the
    Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. No other stock units

The Company also maintains the Republic Services 401(k) Plan
    (the “Plan”), which is a defined contribution plan
    covering all eligible employees. Under the provisions of the
    Plan, participants may direct the Company to defer a portion of
    their compensation to the Plan, subject to a maximum of 15% of
    eligible compensation, as defined. In general, the Company
    provides matching contributions of 50% of the amount contributed
    by each participant up to 4% of the employee’s salary. The
    employer match was made in shares of the Company’s common
    stock through June 30, 2005. During 2005, the Company
    contributed shares of its common stock valued at
    $3.1 million to the Plan. Contributions made after that
    date were funded in cash. Total expense recorded for 2005 was
    $4.2 million. Both employee and Company contributions vest
    immediately.

EARNINGS
    PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares (including deferred
    stock units) outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
    share is based on the combined weighted average number of common
    shares and common share equivalents outstanding which include,

OTHER
    COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

During March 2005, the Company entered into option agreements
    related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under
    SFAS 133, the options qualified for and were designated as
    effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel
    fuel purchases. These option agreements settled each month in
    equal notional amounts through

December 2005. In accordance with SFAS 133, the ineffective
    portion of the change in fair value, which was not material for
    the year ended December 31, 2005, has been included in
    other income (expense), net in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income. Realized gains of $2.5 million
    related to these option agreements are included in cost of
    operations in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
    Income for the year ended December 31, 2005.

In October 2005, the Company entered into a new option agreement
    related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. These option
    agreements commence on January 1, 2006 and settle each
    month in equal notional amounts of 500,000 gallons through
    December 31, 2006. In accordance with SFAS 133,
    $.4 million representing the effective portion of the
    change in fair value as of December 31, 2005, net of tax,
    has been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion
    of the change in fair value was not material and has been
    recorded in other income (expense), net in the Company’s
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

During March 2005, the Company offered to exchange a portion of
    its outstanding 7.125% notes due 2009 for new notes due
    2035. To protect against fluctuations in the forecasted receipt
    of proceeds resulting from the issuance of thirty-year, fixed
    rate debt due to changes in the benchmark U.S. Treasury
    rate, the Company entered into treasury lock agreements. In
    accordance with SFAS 133, these agreements were determined
    to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash proceeds to
    be received upon issuance of the notes. Upon termination of
    these agreements in March 2005, the Company recorded a gain of
    $2.3 million, net of tax, in stockholders’ equity as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income. This gain
    will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the new
    notes using the effective yield method.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is a party to various general legal proceedings
    which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While the
    results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the
    Company believes that losses, if any, resulting from the
    ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. However,
    unfavorable resolution could affect the consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows for the quarterly
    periods in which they are resolved.

Lease
    Commitments

The Company and its subsidiaries lease real property, equipment
    and software under various other operating leases with terms
    from one month to sixteen years. Rent expense during the years
    ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was approximately
    $12.3 million, $11.4 million and $11.4 million,
    respectively.

Unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of
    long-term disposal agreements that require the Company to
    dispose of a minimum number of tons at third-party facilities.

Liability
    Insurance

The Company carries general liability, vehicle liability,
    employment practices liability, pollution liability, directors
    and officers liability, worker’s compensation and
    employer’s liability coverage, as well as umbrella
    liability policies to provide excess coverage over the
    underlying limits contained in these primary policies. The
    Company also carries property insurance.

The Company’s insurance programs for worker’s
    compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and
    employee-related health care benefits are effectively
    self-insured. Claims in excess of self-insurance levels are
    fully insured subject to policy limits. Accruals are based on
    claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported.

During 2003, the Company experienced an increase in expense
    associated with self-insurance. This increase was attributable
    to the expansion of the Company’s operations and various
    changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends
    through the 2003 policy year, based upon actuarial claims
    experience, expected claims development and medical cost
    inflation.

The Company’s liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not
    reported claims at December 31, 2005 (which includes claims
    for worker’s compensation, general liability, vehicle
    liability and employee healthcare benefits) were
    $158.6 million under its current risk management program
    and are included in other current and other

liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    While the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on
    future developments, in management’s opinion, recorded
    reserves are adequate to cover the future payment of claims.
    However, it is possible that recorded reserves may not be
    adequate to cover the future payment of claims. Adjustments, if
    any, to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim
    payments will be reflected in the Consolidated Statements of
    Income in the periods in which such adjustments are known.

Guarantees
    of Subsidiary Debt

The Company has guaranteed the tax-exempt bonds of its
    subsidiaries. If a subsidiary fails to meet its obligations
    associated with tax-exempt bonds as they come due, the Company
    will be required to perform under the related guarantee
    agreement. No additional liability has been recorded for these
    guarantees because the underlying obligations are reflected in
    the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. (For further
    information, see Note 5, Debt).

Restricted
    Cash and Marketable Securities, and Other Financial
    Guarantees

In the normal course of business, the Company is required by
    regulatory agencies, governmental entities and contract parties
    to post performance bonds, letters of credit

and/or

cash
    deposits as financial guarantees of the Company’s
    performance. A summary of letters of credit and surety bonds
    outstanding is as follows:

The Company’s restricted cash deposits and restricted
    marketable securities include restricted cash held for capital
    expenditures under certain debt facilities, and restricted cash
    and restricted marketable securities pledged to regulatory
    agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of

    obligations. These securities are available for sale and, as a
    result, are stated at fair value based upon quoted market
    prices. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are recorded as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Other
    Matters

The Company’s business activities are conducted in the
    context of a developing and changing statutory and regulatory
    framework. Governmental regulation of the waste management
    industry requires the Company to obtain and retain numerous
    governmental permits to conduct various aspects of its
    operations. These permits are subject to revocation,
    modification or denial. The costs and other capital expenditures
    which may be required to obtain or retain the applicable permits
    or comply with applicable regulations could be significant. Any
    revocation, modification or denial of permits could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company.

The Internal Revenue Service is auditing the Company’s
    consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2004.
    Management believes that the tax liabilities recorded are
    adequate. However, a significant assessment in excess of
    liabilities recorded against the Company could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
    covered by this Annual Report. Based upon that evaluation, our
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
    the end of the period covered by this Annual Report in
    accumulating and communicating to our management, including our
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, material
    information required to be included in the reports we file or
    submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as appropriate
    to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Report of
    Management on Republic Services, Inc.’s Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting

We, as members of management of Republic Services, Inc. are
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
    Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
    management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable
    assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that
    could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control
    systems and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of
    the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
    of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
    issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

We, under the supervision of and with the participation of our
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
    Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, assessed the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
    criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting
    described in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    assessment, we concluded that we maintained effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
    based on the specified criteria.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting has been audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
    herein.


Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Based on an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, there has been no change in
    our internal control over financial reporting during our last
    fiscal quarter identified in connection with that evaluation,
    that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
