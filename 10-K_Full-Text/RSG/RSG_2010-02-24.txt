PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

We are the second largest provider of services in the domestic
    non-hazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue. We
    provide non-hazardous solid waste collection services for
    commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers
    through 376 collection companies in 40 states and Puerto
    Rico. We own or operate 223 transfer stations, 192 active solid
    waste landfills and 78 recycling facilities. We also operate
    74 landfill gas and renewable energy projects. We were
    incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1996.

Based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications,
    we believe that the United States non-hazardous solid waste
    services industry generates annual revenue of approximately
    $56 billion, of which approximately 58% is generated by
    publicly owned waste companies. We believe that we and one other
    public waste company generated in excess of 60% of the publicly
    owned companies’ total revenue. Additionally, industry data
    indicates that the non-hazardous waste industry in the United
    States remains fragmented as privately held companies and
    municipal and other local governmental authorities generate
    approximately 16% and 26%, respectively, of total industry
    revenue. In general, growth in the solid waste industry is
    linked to growth in the overall economy, including the level of
    new household and business formation and is subject to changes
    in residential and commercial construction activity.

Our operations are national in scope, but the physical
    collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business;
    therefore, the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our
    markets. By combining local operating management with
    standardized business practices, we can drive greater overall
    operating efficiency across the company, while maintaining

day-to-day

operating decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.
    We implement this strategy through an organizational structure
    that groups our operations within a corporate, region and area
    structure. We manage our operations through four geographic
    operating segments which are also our reportable segments:
    Eastern, Midwest, Southern and Western. The boundaries of our
    operating segments have changed and may continue to change from
    time to time. Each of our regions is organized into several
    operating areas and each area contains multiple operating
    locations. Each of our regions and substantially all our areas
    provide collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services.
    We believe this structure facilitates the integration of our
    operations within each region, which is a critical component of
    our operating strategy, and allows us to maximize the growth
    opportunities in each of our markets and to operate the business
    efficiently, while maintaining effective controls and standards
    over operational and administrative matters, including financial
    reporting. See Note 14,

Segment Reporting,

to our
    consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for further discussion of our operating segments.

On December 5, 2008, we acquired all of the issued and
    outstanding shares of Allied in a

stock-for-stock

transaction for an aggregate purchase price of
    $12.1 billion, which included approximately
    $5.4 billion of debt, at fair value. As a condition of the
    merger with Allied, the Department of Justice (DOJ) required us
    to divest of certain assets and related liabilities. As of
    September 30, 2009, we completed our required divestitures.
    As a result of our acquisition of Allied, we committed to a
    restructuring plan related to our corporate overhead and other
    administrative and operating functions. The plan included
    closing our corporate office in Florida, consolidating
    administrative functions to Arizona, the former headquarters of
    Allied, and reducing staffing levels. The plan also included
    closing and consolidating certain operating locations and
    terminating certain leases. We believe that our merger with
    Allied created a strong operating platform that will allow us to
    continue to provide quality service to our customers and
    superior returns to our stockholders.

We had revenue of $8.2 billion and $3.7 billion and
    operating income of $1.6 billion and $0.3 billion for
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    In addition to our merger with Allied, a number of



items impacted our 2009 and 2008 financial results. For a
    description of these items, see Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Overview of Our
    Business and Consolidated Results of Operations

included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

During the past several years, we supported our internal growth
    strategy with our presence in markets with higher than average
    population growth. We believe our presence in these markets
    positions us to experience growth at rates that are generally
    higher than those of declining population growth.

We continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by
    implementing our financial, operating and growth strategies. In
    order to ensure that our goals relative to these strategies are
    achieved, we have developed and implemented incentive programs
    that help focus our entire company on realizing key performance
    metrics which include increasing free cash flow, achieving
    targeted earnings, maintaining and improving returns on invested
    capital, as well as achieving and maintaining integration
    synergies. Our financial, operating and growth strategies are
    described further herein.

Financial
    Strategy

Key components of our financial strategy include our ability to
    generate free cash flow and sustain or improve our return on
    invested capital. Our definition of free cash flow, which is not
    a measure determined in accordance with United States generally
    accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is cash provided by
    operating activities less purchases of property and equipment,
    plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented
    in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We believe that
    free cash flow is a driver of shareholder value and provides
    useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our
    operating activities after expenditures for property and
    equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment.
    Free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our
    financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in capital assets
    to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital
    assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services
    provided, maintaining our investment grade ratings and
    minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, repurchasing our stock
    and maintaining and improving our market position through
    business optimization. In addition, free cash flow is a key
    metric used to determine management’s compensation.

We manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital
    expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light
    of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely
    managing our working capital, which consists primarily of
    accounts receivable and accounts payable.

We have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize
    shareholder value as well as our return on invested capital. Our
    strategy includes:

•

Customer Service.

We will continue to
    reinvest in our existing fleet of vehicles, equipment, landfills
    and facilities to ensure the highest level of service to our
    customers and the communities we serve. Because of the economic
    slowdown, we were able to lower our capital reinvestment during
    2009 below that which otherwise would have been expected for the
    combined companies. However, we remain acutely focused on
    ensuring that we are not under investing in our business and
    that we have the appropriate complement of physical assets to
    take advantage of additional business resulting from an economic
    recovery. In addition, we continue to focus on innovative waste
    disposal processes and programs to help our customers achieve
    their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound
    waste practices. We believe that these in turn will help us
    achieve profitable growth.

•

Internal Growth.

Price Growth.

Growth through price increases helps
    ensure that we obtain an adequate return on our substantial
    capital investment and the business risk associated with such
    investment. Price increases also allow us to recover historical
    and current year increases in operating costs, which ultimately
    enhances our operating margins.

Volume Growth.

Growth through increases in our
    customer base and services provided is the most capital
    efficient means for us to build our business. This includes not
    only expanding landfill and transfer capacity and investing in
    trucks and containers, but also includes investing in
    information



tools and training needed to ensure high productivity and
    quality service throughout all functional areas of our business.
    We work to increase collection and disposal volumes while
    ensuring that prices charged for such services provide an
    appropriate return on our capital investment.

•

Debt.

During 2009, payments of debt net of
    borrowings were $865.9 million. During 2009, we repaid
    approximately $1.6 billion of senior notes and amounts
    outstanding under our credit facilities primarily using proceeds
    from offering $1.3 billion of senior notes, proceeds from
    disposition of assets and cash flow from operations. As a
    result, we reduced the average coupon rate on our senior notes,
    on a weighted average basis, by more than 130 basis points
    while extending our debt maturities thereby giving greater
    stability to our capital structure. Furthermore, we anticipate
    taking advantage of capital market opportunities to mitigate our
    financial risk by issuing new debt and using the proceeds to
    repay existing debt.

•

Credit Ratings.

We believe that a key
    component of our financial strategy includes maintaining
    investment grade ratings on our senior debt, which was rated BBB
    by Standard & Poor’s, BBB- by Fitch and Baa3 by
    Moody’s as of December 31, 2009. Such ratings have
    allowed us, and should continue to allow us, to readily access
    capital markets at competitive rates. Our cash utilization
    strategy will continue to focus on maintaining our investment
    grade ratings.

•

Dividends.

In July 2003, our Board of
    Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per
    share. Our quarterly dividend has increased from time to time
    thereafter, the latest increase occurring in the third quarter
    of 2008, representing an average annualized growth rate of
    approximately 30%. Our current quarterly cash dividend per share
    is $0.19. We will consider increasing our quarterly cash
    dividend if we believe it will enhance shareholder value.

•

Market Growth and Optimization.

Within our
    markets, our goal is to deliver sustainable, long-term
    profitable growth while efficiently operating our assets to
    generate acceptable rates of return. We allocate capital to
    businesses, markets and development projects to support growth
    while achieving acceptable rates of return. We develop
    previously non-permitted, non-contiguous landfill sites
    (greenfield landfill sites). We also expand our existing
    landfill sites, when possible. We supplement this organic growth
    with acquisitions of operating assets, such as landfills,
    transfer stations, and tuck-in acquisitions of collection and
    disposal operations in existing markets. We continuously
    evaluate our existing operating assets and their deployment
    within each market to determine if we have optimized our
    position and to ensure appropriate investment of capital. Where
    operations are not generating acceptable returns, we examine
    opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and returns
    through the integration of additional assets. If such
    enhancements are not possible, we may ultimately decide to
    divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other
    markets.

•

Share Repurchase.

Once we reduce our debt to
    EBITDA ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, we will
    consider reinstituting our share repurchase program. We believe
    that this may occur sometime during 2011. We intend to execute
    our financial strategy while maintaining flexibility to take
    advantage of market growth opportunities and maintaining our
    investment grade ratings. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. In this
    context, EBITDA is used solely to provide information regarding
    the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and
    is not comparable to EBITDA used by other companies.

For certain risks related to our financial strategy, see
    Item 1A.

Risk Factors

.

Operating
    Strategy

We seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to
    increase operating margins and enhance shareholder value. Our
    operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the
    following:

•

utilize the extensive industry knowledge and experience of our
    executive management team,

•

integrate waste operations,

•

utilize a decentralized management structure in overseeing

day-to-day

operations,



•

improve operating margins through economies of scale, cost
    efficiencies and asset utilization,

•

achieve high levels of customer satisfaction, and

•

utilize business information systems to improve consistency in
    financial and operational performance.

Experienced Executive Management Team.

We
    believe that we have one of the most experienced executive
    management teams in the solid waste industry.

James E. O’Connor, who has served as our Chief Executive
    Officer (CEO) since December 1998, also became our Chairman in
    January 2003. He worked at Waste Management, Inc. from 1972 to
    1978 and from 1982 to 1998. During that time, he served in
    various management positions, including Senior Vice President in
    1997 and 1998, and Area President of Waste Management of
    Florida, Inc. from 1992 to 1997. Mr. O’Connor has
    35 years of experience in the solid waste industry.

Donald W. Slager became our President and Chief Operating
    Officer (COO) upon our merger with Allied in December 2008.
    Prior to the merger, Mr. Slager worked for Allied from 1992
    through 2008 and served in various management positions,
    including President and COO from 2004 through 2008 and Executive
    Vice President and COO from 2003 to 2004. From 2001 to 2003,
    Mr. Slager served as Senior Vice President, Operations. He
    held various management positions at Allied from 1992 to 2003,
    and was previously General Manager at National Waste Services,
    where he served in various management positions since 1985.
    Mr. Slager has over 24 years of experience in the
    solid waste industry.

Tod C. Holmes has served as our Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
    since August 1998. Mr. Holmes served as our Vice President
    of Finance from June 1998 until August 1998 and as Vice
    President of Finance of our former parent company’s Solid
    Waste Group from January 1998 until June 1998. From 1987 to
    1998, Mr. Holmes served in various management positions
    with Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc., including Vice President,
    Investor Relations from 1996 to 1998, Divisional Vice President,
    Collection Operations from 1995 to 1996, Divisional Vice
    President and Regional Controller — Northern Region
    from 1993 to 1995, and Divisional Vice President and Assistant
    Corporate Controller from 1991 to 1993. Mr. Holmes has over
    22 years of experience in the solid waste industry.

Our regional senior vice presidents have an average of
    22 years of experience in the industry.

Continuing Merger Integration Strategy.

On
    December 5, 2008 we completed our merger with Allied. We
    believe that our merger integration strategy is well underway,
    and we continue to believe this merger is different from
    historical attempts to consolidate the waste industry for a
    number of reasons, including the following:

•

Two Mature Companies.

Most previous attempts to
    consolidate the waste industry focused on a “roll up”
    strategy often involving relatively young companies solely
    focused on increasing revenue through acquisitions. Our merger
    with Allied involved two mature companies with similar business
    practices and performance metrics that have been developed and
    refined over the course of a number of years. We believe that
    the combination of our maturity and proven business practices
    and performance metrics has been a critical component of our
    success in 2009 and will be a critical component of our future
    success.

•

Best Practices.

Our merger also affords us the
    opportunity to select the best tools and systems and to adopt
    the best practices of two successful companies. Republic had a
    history of financial discipline evident in the consistent
    generation of increasing levels of free cash flow. Allied was
    noted for its integrated operations and focus on procurement. We
    believe that our merger has given us an unique opportunity to
    combine the strengths of these two successful organizations and
    create a

best-in-class

waste management company.

•

Timely and Focused Integration Process.

We are
    acutely aware that previous acquisitions in the waste management
    and other industries failed because of a lack of focus on
    integration. As such, we began to develop our integration
    process and strategy in June 2008, long before our merger was
    consummated. Our process identified specific integration related
    tasks focused on all levels of the



organization, especially our individual business units. We
    engaged employees at all levels of the company to develop a
    detailed integration plan and to ensure that each of our
    employees understands their role in the process. The integration
    process is well underway and is ahead of schedule.

•

Strong Operating Platform.

The merger has created a
    company with a strong, national operating platform. The
    foundation of this platform is our large network of disposal
    sites. This disposal network provides us with a far stronger
    vertically integrated operating structure than either company
    would have been able to achieve on its own. We believe that our
    improved vertically integrated operations will be a key driver
    of our future profitability.

•

Complementary Operations and Cultures.

The overlay
    of our operating locations reflects another compelling attribute
    of our merger. Republic and Allied operated complementary
    geographies and shared very similar cultures that are centered
    on a commitment to providing “industry-leading solid waste
    and environmental services that exceed our customers’
    highest expectations.”

•

Significant Synergies.

Prior to the effective date
    of our merger with Allied, we identified $150 million of
    annual run-rate integration synergies. We also developed a
    detailed plan for realizing this goal that includes
    participation at all levels throughout the company from the
    drivers of our fleet of collection vehicles to our board of
    directors. This plan anticipated achieving $100 million of
    annual run-rate integration synergies by the end of fiscal 2009.
    As of December 31, 2009, we have already met our original
    goal of $150 million of run-rate synergies and have
    increased our total goal for annual run-rate synergies to
    $165 million to $175 million. We expect to achieve
    this goal by the end of 2010.

•

Strong Capital Structure.

Republic enjoys a strong
    capital structure and investment grade credit ratings
    post-merger. Our combination with Allied has created a company
    that produces substantial annual free cash flow. This strong
    cash producing characteristic will allow us to pursue our
    mission of increasing shareholder value by focusing on investing
    in our business, paying down our debt, funding dividends and
    reinstituting our share repurchase program.

Decentralized Management Structure.

We rely
    on a decentralized management structure to minimize
    administrative overhead costs and to manage our

day-to-day

operations more efficiently. Our local management has extensive
    industry experience in growing, operating and managing solid
    waste companies and has substantial experience in their local
    geographic markets. Each regional management team includes a
    senior vice president, vice president-controller, vice president
    of human resources, vice president of sales, vice president of
    operations support, director of safety, director of engineering
    and environmental management, and director of market planning
    and development. We believe that our strong regional management
    teams allow us to more effectively and efficiently drive our
    initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout our
    organization. Our regional management teams and our area
    presidents have extensive authority, responsibility and autonomy
    for operations within their respective geographic markets.
    Compensation for our area management teams is primarily based on
    improving operating income produced and the free cash flow and
    return on invested capital generated in each manager’s
    geographic area of responsibility. In addition, through
    long-term incentive programs, including stock options, we
    believe we have achieved one of the lowest turnover levels in
    the industry for our local management teams. As a result of
    retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and
    involvement in their local communities, we are proactive in
    anticipating our customers’ needs and adjusting to changes
    in our markets. We also seek to implement the best practices of
    our various regions and areas throughout our operations to
    improve operating margins.

Integrated Operations.

We seek to achieve a
    high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from
    the point of collection through disposal. We expect that our
    fully integrated markets generally will have a lower cost of
    operations and more favorable cash flows than our non-integrated
    markets. Through acquisitions, landfill operating agreements and
    other market development activities, we create market-specific,
    integrated operations typically consisting of one or more
    collection companies, transfer stations and landfills. We
    consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with
    significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels
    of waste volume. We also seek to acquire solid waste collection
    companies in markets in which we own or operate landfills. In
    addition, we generate internal growth in our disposal operations
    by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills
    from time to time in markets in which we have



significant collection operations or in markets that we
    determine lack sufficient disposal capacity. During the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 68% and
    58%, respectively, of the total waste volume that we collected
    was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate
    (internalization). This increase in internalization is due to a
    higher concentration of integrated hauling and landfill
    operations acquired in our merger with Allied. In a number of
    our larger markets, we and our competitors are required to take
    waste to government-controlled disposal facilities
    (flow-control). This provides us with an opportunity to
    effectively compete in these markets without investing in
    landfill capacity. Because we do not have landfill facilities or
    government-controlled disposal facilities for all markets in
    which we provide collection services, we believe that landfill
    and transfer station acquisitions, operating agreements, and
    market development give us the opportunity to increase our waste
    internalization rate and further integrate our operations. By
    further integrating operations in existing markets, we may be
    able to reduce our disposal costs.

Economies of Scale, Cost Efficiencies and Asset
    Utilization.

We continue to identify and implement
    best practices throughout our organization with the goal of
    permanently improving overall operating and financial results.
    These best practice initiatives focus on critical areas of our
    operations such as landfill operations, truck routing,
    maintenance and related service efficiencies, purchasing and
    administrative activities. The consolidation of acquired
    businesses into existing operations reduces costs by decreasing
    capital and expenses used for truck routing, personnel,
    equipment and vehicle maintenance, inventories and back-office
    administration. Generally, we consolidate our acquired
    administrative centers to reduce our general and administrative
    costs. Of particular benefit are the opportunities associated
    with the blending of operations as a result of the Allied
    merger. Scheduled for full completion by the first half of 2010,
    these markets offer the potential for marked improvement in
    operating results. Generally speaking, there are significant
    opportunities in these markets to leverage economies of scale
    and the existing asset base, while realizing improved operating
    efficiencies. Upon the completion of the integration of Allied,
    our goal is to maintain our selling, general and administrative
    costs at no more than 10.0% of revenue, which we believe is
    appropriate given our existing business platform. In addition,
    our procurement initiatives ensure that we negotiate the best
    volume discounts for goods and services purchased, including
    waste disposal rates at landfills operated by third parties.
    Furthermore, we have taken steps to maximize the utilization of
    our assets. For example, to reduce the number of collection
    vehicles and maximize the efficiency of our fleet and drivers,
    we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and
    improve operating density. By using assets more efficiently,
    operating expenses can be reduced.

High Levels of Customer Satisfaction.

We
    strive to provide the highest level of service to our customer
    base. Our policy is to periodically visit each commercial
    account to ensure customer satisfaction and to verify that we
    are providing the appropriate level of service. In addition to
    visiting existing customers, a salesperson develops a base of
    prospective customers within each market. We also have municipal
    marketing representatives in most service areas that are
    responsible for working with each municipality or community to
    which we provide residential service to ensure customer
    satisfaction. Additionally, the municipal representatives
    organize and drive the effort to obtain new or renew municipal
    contracts in their service areas.

Focus on Systems Utilization.

We continue to
    invest in the integration and expansion of our information
    systems and technology platform. Our future platform will
    consist of

best-in-class

legacy systems from both Republic and Allied. During 2009, we
    converted the entire company to a single payable and general
    ledger system. Additionally, we made significant progress in
    converting to a single operating system. We expect to complete
    our operating system conversion by the third quarter of 2010. In
    addition, during January 2010, we converted the entire company
    to a single payroll and human resource system. Our future
    technology related initiatives will include customer
    relationship management, billing, productivity and maintenance
    systems. We believe that the combination of these systems will
    prove to be a competitive advantage for our company.

Growth
    Strategy

Our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue, gaining
    market share and enhancing shareholder value through internal
    growth and acquisitions. We manage our growth strategy as
    follows:

Internal Growth.

Our internal growth strategy
    focuses on retaining existing customers and obtaining new
    commercial, municipal and industrial customers through our
    well-managed sales and marketing activities.

•

Pricing Activities.

We seek to secure price
    increases necessary to offset increased costs, to improve our
    operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our
    substantial investments in assets such as our landfills. During
    2009, we continued to secure broad-based price increases across
    all lines of our business to offset various escalating capital
    and operating costs. Price increases will remain a major
    component of our overall future operating strategy.

•

Long-Term Contracts.

We seek to obtain long-term
    contracts for collecting solid waste in markets with growing
    populations. These include exclusive franchise agreements with
    municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts.
    By obtaining such long-term agreements, we have the opportunity
    to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the
    underlying population growth in these markets. We believe it is
    important to have secured exclusive, long-term franchise
    agreements in growing market areas. We believe that this
    positions us to experience internal growth rates that are
    generally higher than our industry’s overall growth rate.
    In addition, we believe that by securing a base of long-term
    recurring revenue in growing population markets, we are better
    able to protect our market position from competition and our
    business may be less susceptible to downturns in economic
    conditions.

•

Sales and Marketing Activities.

We seek to manage
    our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on
    our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate.
    We provide a National Accounts program in response to the needs
    of our national clients, centralizing services to effectively
    manage their needs, such as minimizing their procurement costs.
    We currently have approximately 1,000 sales and marketing
    employees in the field who are compensated using a commission
    structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality
    revenue. For the most part, these employees directly solicit
    business from existing and prospective commercial, industrial,
    municipal and residential customers. We emphasize our rate and
    cost structures when we train new and existing sales personnel.
    In addition, we utilize a customer relationship management
    system that assists our sales people in tracking leads. It also
    tracks renewal periods for potential commercial, industrial and
    franchise contracts.

•

Development Activities.

We seek to identify
    opportunities to further our position as an integrated service
    provider in markets where we provide services for a portion of
    the waste stream. Where appropriate, we seek to obtain permits
    to build transfer stations, recycling facilities, and landfills
    that would provide vertically integrated waste services or
    expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites.
    Development projects, while generally less capital intensive
    than acquiring such projects, typically require extensive
    permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no
    assurance of success. We undertake development projects when we
    believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where
    reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available.

Acquisition Growth.

We look to acquire
    businesses that complement our existing business platform. Our
    acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on privately held
    solid waste companies and the waste operations of municipal and
    other local governmental authorities. We believe that our
    ability to acquire privately held companies is enhanced by
    increasing competition in the solid waste industry, increasing
    capital requirements as a result of changes in solid waste
    regulatory requirements, and the limited number of exit
    strategies for these privately held companies’ owners. We
    also seek to acquire operations and facilities from
    municipalities that are privatizing, as they seek to increase
    available capital and reduce risk. In addition, we will continue
    to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities
    that are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies.
    In sum, our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on the
    following:

•

acquiring privately held businesses that position us for growth
    in existing and new markets,

•

acquiring well-managed companies and, when appropriate,
    retaining local management, and



•

acquiring operations and facilities from municipalities that are
    privatizing and from publicly owned companies that are divesting
    of assets.

We also seek to acquire landfills, transfer stations and
    collection companies that operate in markets that we are already
    servicing in order to fully integrate our operations from
    collection to disposal. In addition, we have in the past and may
    continue in the future to exchange businesses with other solid
    waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our
    business platform. These activities allow us to increase our
    revenue and market share, lower our cost of operations as a
    percentage of revenue, and consolidate duplicative facilities
    and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of
    scale.

For certain risks related to our growth strategy, see
    Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

Operations

Our operations primarily consist of the collection, transfer and
    disposal of non-hazardous solid waste.

Collection Services.

We provide solid waste
    collection services to commercial, industrial, municipal and
    residential customers through 376 collection companies. In 2009,
    76.9% of our revenue was derived from collection services.
    Within the collection line of business, 35% of our revenue is
    from services provided to municipal and residential customers,
    40% is from services provided to commercial customers, and 25%
    is from services provided to industrial and other customers.

Our residential collection operations involve the curbside
    collection of refuse from small containers into collection
    vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to
    landfills. Residential solid waste collection services are
    typically performed under contracts with municipalities, which
    we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us
    exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in
    their respective jurisdictions. These contracts or franchises
    usually range in duration from one to five years, although some
    of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer
    periods. Residential solid waste collection services may also be
    performed on a subscription basis, in which individual
    households contract directly with us. The fees received for
    subscription residential collection are based primarily on
    market factors, frequency and type of service, the distance to
    the disposal facility and the cost of disposal. In general,
    subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in
    advance by the residential customers receiving the service.

In our commercial and industrial collection operations, we
    supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes. We
    also rent compactors to large waste generators. Commercial
    collection services are generally performed under one- to
    three-year service agreements, and fees are determined by
    considerations such as market factors, collection frequency,
    type of equipment furnished, the type and volume or weight of
    the waste collected, transportation costs, the distance to the
    disposal facility, and the cost of disposal.

We also provide waste collection services to industrial and
    construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms
    ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer. Our
    construction services are provided to the commercial
    construction and home building sectors. We collect the
    containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to
    a landfill or a transfer station for disposal.

We also provide recycling services in certain markets in
    compliance with local laws or the terms of our franchise
    agreements. These services include the curbside collection of
    residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of
    recycling services to commercial and industrial customers.

Transfer and Disposal Services.

We own or
    operate 223 transfer stations. We deposit waste at these
    transfer stations, as do other private haulers and municipal
    haulers, for compaction and transfer to trailers for transport
    to disposal sites or recycling facilities. In 2009, transfer and
    disposal services accounted for 18.9% of our revenue.

As of December 31, 2009, we owned or operated 192 active
    landfills, which had approximately 35,000 permitted acres and
    total available permitted and probable expansion disposal
    capacity of approximately 4.6 billion in-place cubic yards.
    The in-place capacity of our landfills is subject to change
    based on engineering factors, requirements of regulatory
    authorities, our ability to continue to operate our landfills in
    compliance with applicable regulations, and our ability to
    successfully renew operating permits and obtain



expansion permits at our sites. Some of our landfills accept
    non-hazardous special waste, including utility ash, asbestos and
    contaminated soils.

Most of our active landfill sites have the potential for
    expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted
    acreage. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal
    capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue
    an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste
    volumes and prices, market needs, remaining capacity and
    likelihood of obtaining an expansion. To satisfy future disposal
    demand, we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at
    certain of our landfills. However, we cannot assure you that all
    proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed.

We also have responsibility for 132 closed landfills, for which
    we have associated closure and post-closure obligations.

Landfill Gas and Renewable Energy
    Projects.

During 2009, we brought eleven landfill

gas-to-energy

projects on line, bringing our total number of such projects to
    74 or over one third of our active landfills. These projects
    consist of the following:

•

51 electric generating plants powered by landfill gas,

•

14 medium Btu plants that provide landfill gas to industrial
    users,

•

6 high Btu plants that produce pipeline quality gas, and

•

3 projects that use landfill gas to power leachate evaporating
    equipment.

Our 51 electric projects generate 323 megawatts of electricity,
    enough to power approximately 192,000 homes. Our 23 other
    projects provide or process more than 58,000 square cubic
    feet per minute of gas, enough to heat almost 200,000 homes. The
    environmental benefit of all of our projects combined is the
    equivalent of removing nearly 4 million cars from the road.

During 2009, we also combined a

first-of-its-kind

solar technology with an existing

gas-to-energy

system which turned our Tessman Road Landfill in
    San Antonio, Texas into a sustainable energy park. A closed
    portion of the landfill is now capped with a Solar Energy Cover,
    developed by Republic, which generates electricity for homes and
    businesses in the surrounding area. We expect to install a
    similar system at one or more of our landfills during 2010.

Many of our landfills that do not have

gas-to-energy

or renewable energy projects are capable of supporting such
    projects. As a result, we intend to bring several of these
    projects on line each year for many years to come.

Recycling Facilities and Other Services.

We
    own or operate 78 materials recovery facilities and other
    recycling operations. These facilities sort recyclable paper,
    aluminum, glass and other materials. Most of these recyclable
    materials are internally collected by our residential collection
    operations. In some areas, we receive commercial and industrial
    solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable
    materials and non-recyclable waste. The recyclable materials are
    salvaged, repackaged and sold to third parties, and the
    non-recyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators.

Sales and
    Marketing

We seek to provide quality services that will enable us to
    maintain high levels of customer satisfaction. We derive our
    business from a broad customer base, which we believe will
    enable us to experience stable growth. We focus our marketing
    efforts on continuing and expanding our business with existing
    customers, as well as attracting new customers.

We employ approximately 1,000 sales and marketing employees. Our
    sales and marketing strategy is to provide high-quality,
    comprehensive solid waste collection, recycling, transfer and
    disposal services to our customers at competitive prices. We
    target potential customers of all sizes, from small quantity
    generators to large “Fortune 500” companies and
    municipalities.



Most of our marketing activity is local in nature. However, we
    also provide a national accounts program in response to the
    needs of some of our national and regional customers. Our
    national accounts program is designed to provide the best total
    solution to our customers’ evolving waste management needs
    in an environmentally responsible manner. We partner with our
    national clients to reach their sustainability goals, optimize
    waste streams, balance equipment and service intervals, and
    provide customized reporting. The national accounts program
    centralizes services to effectively manage customer needs, while
    helping minimize procurement costs. With our extended geographic
    reach, our national accounts program effectively serves
    40 states and Puerto Rico. As industry leaders, our mission
    is to utilize our strengths and expertise to exceed customer
    expectations by consistently delivering the best national
    program available.

We generally do not change the trade names of the local
    businesses we acquire, and therefore we do not operate
    nationally under any one mark or trade name.

Customers

We provide services to a broad base of commercial, industrial,
    municipal and residential customers. No one customer has
    individually accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated
    revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last
    three years.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Entry into our
    business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry
    require substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience.

Competition in the non-hazardous solid waste industry comes from
    a few large, national publicly owned companies, including Waste
    Management, Inc., several regional publicly and privately owned
    solid waste companies, and thousands of small privately owned
    companies. In any given market, competitors may have larger
    operations and greater resources. In addition to national and
    regional firms and numerous local companies, we compete with
    municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal
    operations. These municipalities may have financial advantages
    due to the availability of tax revenue and tax-exempt financing.

We compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of
    price and the quality of our services. From time to time, our
    competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort
    to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal
    contract. Our ability to increase prices in certain markets may
    be impacted by the pricing policies of our competitors. This may
    have an impact on our future revenue and profitability.

Seasonality
    and Severe Weather

Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement
    or severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste
    collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding
    compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste,
    reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or
    delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and
    other facilities.

Regulation

Our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of
    federal, state and local requirements that regulate the
    environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use.
    Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals
    generally are required for landfills and transfer stations,
    certain solid waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and
    other facilities that we own or operate. These permits are
    subject to denial, revocation, modification and renewal in
    certain circumstances. Federal, state and local laws and
    regulations vary, but generally govern wastewater or storm water
    discharges, air emissions, the handling, transportation,
    treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous
    waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with the
    release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These
    laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with
    strict powers of enforcement, which include the ability to
    revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits, obtain
    injunctions, or impose fines or penalties in the case of
    violations, including



criminal penalties. The U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) and various other federal, state and local
    authorities administer these regulations.

We strive to conduct our operations in compliance with
    applicable laws, regulations and permits. However, in the
    existing climate of heightened environmental concerns, from time
    to time we have been issued citations or notices from
    governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to
    expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various
    landfills and other facilities. We cannot assure you that
    citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite
    our regulatory compliance efforts. We have established final
    capping, closure, post-closure and remediation liabilities that
    we believe, based on currently available information, will be
    adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs.
    However, we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed
    our reserves. Refer to the Contractual Obligations table within
    Item 7.

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”

contained elsewhere herein for further information.

Federal Regulation.

The following summarizes
    the primary federal environmental and occupational health and
    safety-related statutes that affect our facilities and
    operations:

•

The Solid Waste Disposal Act, including the Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act

(RCRA). RCRA establishes a
    framework for regulating the handling, transportation,
    treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous
    solid waste, and requires states to develop programs to ensure
    the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills.

Subtitle D of RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the
    disposal of municipal solid waste. Regulations under Subtitle D
    currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management
    criteria and guidelines, including location restrictions,
    facility design and operating criteria, final capping, closure
    and post-closure requirements, financial assurance standards,
    groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action
    standards, many of which had not commonly been in effect or
    enforced in the past in connection with municipal solid waste
    landfills. Each state was required to submit to the EPA a permit
    program designed to implement Subtitle D regulations by
    April 9, 1993. All of the states in which we operate have
    implemented permit programs pursuant to RCRA and Subtitle D.
    These state permit programs may include landfill requirements
    which are more stringent than those of Subtitle D. Our failure
    to comply with the environmental requirements of federal, state
    and local authorities at any of our locations may lead to
    temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit.

All of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill
    development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed
    Subtitle D requirements. Operating and design criteria for
    existing operations have been modified to comply with these
    regulations. Compliance with Subtitle D regulations has resulted
    in increased costs and may in the future require substantial
    additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally
    associated with our waste management activities.

•

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980

(CERCLA). CERCLA, among other things,
    provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release
    or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the
    environment. CERCLA may impose strict joint and several
    liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural
    resources upon current owners and operators of a site, parties
    who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous
    substances were disposed of, parties who transported the
    hazardous substances to a site and parties who arranged for the
    disposal of the hazardous substances at a site. Under the
    authority of CERCLA and its implementing regulations, detailed
    requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and
    remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances
    have been or are threatened to be released into the environment.
    Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the existence or
    disposal of only “hazardous wastes,” but can also be
    based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700
    “substances” characterized by the EPA as
    “hazardous,” many of which are found in common
    household waste.

Among other things, CERCLA authorizes the federal government to
    investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances
    have been or are threatened to be released into the environment
    or to order (or offer an opportunity to) persons potentially
    liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so.



In addition, the EPA has established a National Priorities List
    of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are
    threatened to be released and which require investigation or
    cleanup.

CERCLA liability is strict liability. It can be founded upon the
    release or threatened release, even as a result of
    unintentional, non-negligent or lawful action, of hazardous
    substances, including very small quantities of such substances.
    Thus, even if we have never knowingly transported or received
    hazardous waste, it is likely that hazardous substances have
    been deposited or “released” at landfills or other
    properties owned by third parties where we have transported to
    and disposed of waste or at our landfills or at other properties
    that we currently own or operate or may have owned or operated.
    Therefore, we could be liable under CERCLA for the cost of
    cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for
    damages to natural resources, even if those substances were
    deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them.
    The costs of a CERCLA cleanup can be very expensive. Given the
    difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment
    liability, such liability could have a material impact on our
    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

•

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972

(the
    Clean Water Act). This act regulates the discharge of pollutants
    from a variety of sources, including solid waste disposal sites,
    into streams, rivers and other waters of the United States.
    Point source runoff from our landfills and transfer stations
    that is discharged into surface waters must be covered by
    discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling
    and monitoring, and, under certain circumstances, reduce the
    quantity of pollutants in those discharges. Storm water
    discharge regulations under the Clean Water Act require a permit
    for certain construction activities and discharges from
    industrial operations and facilities, which may affect our
    operations. If a landfill or transfer station discharges
    wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly owned treatment
    works, the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by
    that treatment works. In addition, states may adopt groundwater
    protection programs under the Clean Water Act or the Safe
    Drinking Water Act that could affect solid waste landfills.
    Furthermore, development which alters or affects wetlands
    generally must be permitted prior to such development
    commencing, and permitting agencies may require mitigation.

•

The Clean Air Act.

The Clean Air Act imposes
    limitations on emissions from various sources, including
    landfills. In March 1996, the EPA promulgated regulations that
    require large municipal solid waste landfills to install
    landfill gas monitoring systems. These regulations apply to
    landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction or
    modification on or after May 30, 1991, and, principally, to
    landfills that can accommodate 2.5 million cubic meters or
    more of municipal solid waste. The regulations apply whether the
    landfill is active or closed. The date by which each affected
    landfill is required to have a gas collection and control system
    installed and made operational varies depending on calculated
    emission rates at the landfill. Efforts to curtail the emission
    of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effect of climate
    change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent
    emission controls, with resulting capital or operating costs.
    See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

— “Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions
    could impose costs on our operations, the magnitude of which we
    cannot yet estimate.” Many state regulatory agencies also
    currently require monitoring systems for the collection and
    control of certain landfill gas.

•

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970

(OSHA). OSHA authorizes the Occupational Safety and
    Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor to
    promulgate occupational safety and health standards. A number of
    these standards, including standards for notices of hazardous
    chemicals and the handling of asbestos, apply to our facilities
    and operations.

State and Local Regulation.

Each state in
    which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing
    solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most
    cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and
    liabilities for such matters. States also have adopted
    regulations governing the design, operation, maintenance and
    closure of landfills and transfer stations. Some counties,
    municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar
    laws and regulations. Our facilities and operations are likely
    to be subject to these types of requirements. In addition, our
    solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected
    by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of
    solid waste reduction and recycling programs. For example,
    several states have enacted laws that require counties or
    municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce, through
    solid waste planning, composting, recycling or other programs,
    the volume of solid waste deposited in



landfills. Additionally, laws and regulations restricting the
    disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills, including
    yard waste, newspapers, beverage containers, unshredded tires,
    lead-acid batteries, electronic wastes and household appliances,
    have been promulgated in several states and are being considered
    in others. Legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or
    encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also
    have been or are under consideration by the U.S. Congress
    and the EPA.

To construct, operate and expand a landfill, we must obtain one
    or more construction or operating permits, as well as zoning and
    land use approvals. These permits and approvals may be difficult
    and time-consuming to obtain and to operate in compliance with,
    are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’
    groups, may be subject to periodic renewal, and are subject to
    denial, modification, non-renewal and revocation by the issuing
    agency. In connection with our acquisition of existing
    landfills, we may be required to expend considerable time,
    effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into
    compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the
    permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity.

Other Regulations.

Many of our facilities own
    and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to
    store petroleum-based products. These tanks are generally
    subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that
    mandate their periodic testing, upgrading, closure and removal,
    and that, in the event of leaks, require that polluted
    groundwater and soils be remediated. We believe that all of our
    underground storage tanks currently meet all applicable
    regulations. If underground storage tanks we own or operate
    leak, we could be liable for response costs and, if the leakage
    migrates onto the property of others, we could be liable for
    damages to third parties. We are unaware of facts indicating
    that issues of compliance with regulations related to
    underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows.

With regard to our solid waste transportation operations, we are
    subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board
    and are regulated by the Federal Highway Administration, Office
    of Motor Carriers, and by regulatory agencies in states that
    regulate such matters. Various states and local government
    authorities have enacted or promulgated, or are considering
    enacting or promulgating, laws and regulations that would
    restrict the transportation of solid waste across state, county,
    or other jurisdiction lines. In 1978, the U.S. Supreme
    Court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of

out-of-state

solid waste was unconstitutional; however, states have attempted
    to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and
    implicated by that ruling. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled that
    a flow control law, which attempted to restrict solid waste from
    leaving its place of generation, imposed an impermissible burden
    upon interstate commerce, and, therefore, was unconstitutional.
    In 2007, the Supreme Court upheld the right of a local
    government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly owned
    waste facility. A number of county and other local jurisdictions
    have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the
    free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries.
    Other governments may enact similar regulations in the future.
    These regulations may, in some cases, cause a decline in volumes
    of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may
    increase our costs of disposal, thereby adversely affecting our
    operations.

Liabilities Established for Landfill and Environmental
    Costs.

We have established liabilities for landfill
    and environmental costs, which include landfill site final
    capping, closure and post-closure costs. We periodically
    reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions
    regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of
    Subtitle D of RCRA, and we adjust our rates used to expense
    final capping, closure and post-closure costs accordingly. Based
    on current information and regulatory requirements, we believe
    that our liabilities recorded for such landfill and
    environmental expenditures are adequate. However, environmental
    laws may change, and we cannot assure you that our recorded
    liabilities will be adequate to cover requirements under
    existing or new environmental laws and regulations, future
    changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or
    adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us.

Liability
    Insurance and Bonding

The nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities
    arising out of our operations, including possible damages to the
    environment. Such potential liabilities could involve, for
    example, claims for remediation costs, personal injury, property
    damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be
    held



responsible for the escape of harmful materials; claims of
    employees, customers or third parties for personal injury or
    property damage occurring in the course of our operations; or
    claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning
    or performance of work. We could also be subject to fines and
    civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged
    violations of regulatory requirements. Because of the nature and
    scope of the possible environmental damages, liabilities imposed
    in environmental litigation can be significant. Our solid waste
    operations have third party environmental liability insurance
    with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations,
    subject to certain limitations and exclusions. However, we
    cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance
    would be adequate, in scope or amount, in the event of a major
    loss, nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry
    excess environmental liability insurance should market
    conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs
    prohibitive.

We have general liability, vehicle liability, employment
    practices liability, pollution liability, directors and
    officers’ liability, workers’ compensation and
    employer’s liability coverage, as well as umbrella
    liability policies to provide excess coverage over the
    underlying limits contained in these primary policies. We also
    carry property insurance. Although we try to operate safely and
    prudently and we have, subject to limitations and exclusions,
    substantial liability insurance, we cannot assure you that we
    will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.

Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. Claims in excess of
    self-insurance levels are insured subject to the excess policy
    limits and exclusions. Accruals are based on claims filed and
    actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred
    but not reported. Due to the variable condition of the insurance
    market, we have experienced, and may experience in the future,
    increased self-insurance retention levels and increased
    premiums. As we assume more risk for self-insurance through
    higher retention levels, we may experience more variability in
    our self-insurance reserves and expense.

In the normal course of business, we post performance bonds,
    insurance policies, letters of credit, or cash or marketable
    securities deposits in connection with municipal residential
    collection contracts, the operation, closure or post-closure of
    landfills, environmental remediation, environmental permits, and
    business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our
    performance. To date, we have satisfied financial responsibility
    requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or
    by obtaining bank letters of credit, insurance policies or
    surety bonds.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we employed approximately
    31,000 full-time employees, approximately 27% of whom were
    covered by collective bargaining agreements. From time to time,
    our operating locations may experience union organizing efforts.
    We have not historically experienced any significant work
    stoppages. We currently have no disputes or bargaining
    circumstances that we believe could cause significant
    disruptions in our business. Our management believes that we
    have good relations with our employees.

    after the date of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

We
    have substantial indebtedness, which may limit our financial
    flexibility.

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    $7.4 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases
    outstanding. This amount of indebtedness and our debt service
    requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access
    additional capital and make capital expenditures and other
    investments in our business, to withstand economic downturns and
    interest rate increases, to plan for or react to changes in our
    business and our industry, and to comply with the financial and
    other restrictive covenants of our debt instruments. Further,
    our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants
    contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in
    economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond
    our control. If we do not comply with these covenants and
    restrictions, we may be required to take actions such as
    reducing or delaying capital expenditures, reducing dividends,
    selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of our
    existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital.

The
    downturn in the U.S. economy may continue to have an adverse
    impact on our operating results.

A weak economy generally results in decreases in the volumes of
    waste generated. In 2009, weakness in the U.S. economy had
    a negative effect on our revenue, operating results and
    operating cash flows. The current and previous economic
    slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection
    business servicing the manufacturing and construction industries
    and our proceeds from sales of recycled commodities. As a result
    of the global economic crisis, we may experience the negative
    effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer
    turnover as well. We cannot assure you that worsening economic
    conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a
    significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, we
    cannot assure you that an improvement in economic conditions
    will result in an immediate, or any, improvement in our
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash
    flows.

The
    downturn in the U.S. economy may expose us to credit risk for
    amounts due from governmental agencies, large national accounts
    and others.

The weak U.S. economy has reduced the amount of taxes
    collected by various governmental agencies. We provide services
    to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities.
    These governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties
    resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be



unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us. In addition, the
    weak economy may cause other customers, including our large
    national accounts, to suffer financial difficulties and
    ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us.
    This could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The
    downturn in the U.S. economy and in the financial markets could
    expose us to counter-party risk associated with our
    derivatives.

To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in various commodities
    and interest rates, we have entered into a number of derivative
    agreements. These derivative agreements require us or the
    counter-party to such agreements to make payments to the other
    party if the price of certain commodities or interest rates vary
    from a specified amount. A continued downturn in the
    U.S. economy or in the financial markets could adversely
    impact the financial stability of the counter-parties with which
    we do business, potentially limiting their ability to fulfill
    their obligations under our derivative agreements. This could
    have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.

The
    waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors
    that may have greater financial and operational resources,
    flexibility to reduce prices and other competitive advantages
    that could make it difficult for us to compete
    effectively.

We principally compete with large national waste management
    companies, municipalities and numerous regional and local
    companies for collection and disposal accounts. Competition for
    collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality
    of services. Competition for disposal business is primarily
    based on disposal costs, geographic location and quality of
    operations. Some of our competitors may have greater financial
    and operational resources than us. Many counties and
    municipalities that operate their own waste collection and
    disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or
    tax-exempt financing. Our ability to obtain solid waste volume
    for our landfills may also be limited by the fact that some
    major collection companies also own or operate landfills to
    which they send their waste. In markets in which we do not own
    or operate a landfill, our collection operations may operate at
    a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors. As a result of
    these factors, we may have difficulty competing effectively from
    time to time or in certain markets. If we were to lower prices
    to address these competitive issues, it could negatively impact
    our revenue growth and profitability.

Price
    increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased
    costs and may cause us to lose volume.

We seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased
    costs (including fuel and environmental costs), to improve
    operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our
    substantial investments in assets such as our landfills. From
    time to time, our competitors may reduce their prices in an
    effort to expand their market share. Contractual, general
    economic or market-specific conditions may also limit our
    ability to raise prices. As a result, we may be unable to offset
    increases in costs, improve our operating margins and obtain
    adequate investment returns through price increases. We may also
    lose volume to lower-cost competitors.

Increases
    in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals will increase our
    operating expenses, and we cannot assure you that we will be
    able to recover fuel or oil cost increases from our
    customers.

We depend on fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and
    other equipment used for collection, transfer, and disposal. We
    buy fuel in the open market. Fuel prices are unpredictable and
    can fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control,
    including geopolitical developments, actions by the Organization
    of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil and gas
    producers, supply and demand for oil and gas, war, terrorism and
    unrest in oil-producing countries, and regional production
    patterns. We may not be able to offset such volatility through
    fuel surcharges. For example, our fuel costs were
    $349.8 million in 2009, representing 7.2% of our cost of
    operations compared to $235.3 million in 2008, representing
    9.7% of our cost of operations

.

This decrease in fuel
    costs as a percent of our cost of operations primarily reflects
    a decrease in the price of fuel.



In order to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices, we
    have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or
    make payments to counter-parties if the price of fuel varies
    from a specified amount. However, we do not hedge our entire
    fuel usage. During 2009, only 6.4% of our fuel purchases were
    hedged.

Over the last several years, regulations have been adopted
    mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions and, in
    October 2009, the EPA indicated it will establish the first
    U.S. standards for greenhouse gas emissions from
    automobiles. The regulations could affect the type of fuel our
    trucks use and could materially increase the cost and
    consumption of our fuel. Our operations also require the use of
    products (such as liners at our landfills) whose costs may vary
    with the price of petrochemicals. An increase in the price of
    petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products, which
    would increase our operating and capital costs. We are also
    susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our
    vendors.

Fluctuations
    in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may
    adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results
    of operations and cash flows.

We process recyclable materials such as paper, cardboard,
    plastics, aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties.
    Our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or
    market requirements for recyclable materials. The resale and
    purchase prices of, and market demand for, recyclable materials
    can be volatile due to changes in economic conditions and
    numerous other factors beyond our control. These fluctuations
    may affect our consolidated financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

Adverse
    weather conditions may limit our operations and increase the
    costs of collection and disposal.

Our collection and landfill operations could be adversely
    impacted by extended periods of inclement weather, or by
    increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting in
    the future from climate change, any of which could increase the
    volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without
    corresponding compensation), interfere with collection and
    landfill operations, delay the development of landfill capacity
    or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers. In
    addition, adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary
    suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect our
    operating results in the affected regions during those periods.

We
    currently have matters pending with the Internal Revenue Service
    (the “IRS”), which could result in large cash
    expenditures and could have a material adverse impact on our
    operating results and cash flows.

We are currently under examination by the IRS with regard to
    Allied’s federal income tax returns for tax years 2007 and
    2008, and Allied’s 2000 through 2006 federal income tax
    returns are at appeals. Republic is under audit for its 2007 and
    2008 federal income tax returns, and under examination for its
    2008 federal income tax return.

During its examination of Allied’s 2002 tax year, the IRS
    asserted that a 2002 redemption of four partnership interests in

waste-to-energy

businesses should have been recharacterized as disguised sale
    transactions. This issue is currently before the Appeals
    Division of the IRS. The Company believes its position is
    supported by relevant technical authorities and strong business
    purpose and we intend to vigorously defend our position on this
    matter. The potential tax and interest through December 31,
    2009 (to the extent unpaid) have been fully reserved in our
    consolidated balance sheet. A disallowance would not materially
    affect our consolidated results of operations; however, a
    deficiency payment would adversely impact our cash flow in the
    period the payment was made. The accrual of additional interest
    charges through the time this matter is resolved will affect our
    consolidated results of operations. In addition, the successful
    assertion by the IRS of penalty and penalty-related interest in
    connection with this matter could have a material adverse impact
    on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows.

Additionally, during its examination of Allied’s 2000
    through 2003 tax years, the IRS proposed that certain landfill
    costs be allocated to the collection and control of methane gas
    that is naturally emitted from landfills. The IRS’ position
    is that the methane gas emitted by a landfill constitutes a
    joint product resulting from landfill operations and, therefore,
    associated costs should not be expensed until the methane gas is
    sold or otherwise disposed. We believe we have several
    meritorious defenses, including the fact that methane gas is



not actively produced for sale by us but rather arises naturally
    in the context of providing disposal services. Therefore, we
    believe that the resolution of this issue will not have a
    material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

For additional information on these matters, see Note 10,

Income Taxes,

to our consolidated financial statements in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Other matters may also arise in the course of tax audits that
    could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows.

We may
    be unable to execute our financial strategy.

Our ability to execute our financial strategy depends on our
    ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt.
    The credit rating process is contingent upon a number of
    factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure
    you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade
    ratings in the future. Our interest expense would increase and
    our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be
    adversely affected should we fail to maintain investment grade
    ratings.

Our financial strategy is also dependent on our ability to
    generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing
    business, fund internal growth, acquire other solid waste
    businesses, pay dividends, reduce indebtedness and minimize
    borrowings, and take other actions to enhance shareholder value.
    We cannot assure you that: we will be successful in executing
    our broad-based pricing program; we will generate sufficient
    cash flow to execute our financial strategy; we will be able to
    pay cash dividends at our present rate, that we will be able to
    increase the amount of such dividends, or that we will be able
    to reinstitute our share repurchase program.

A
    downgrade in our bond ratings could adversely affect our
    liquidity by increasing the cost of debt and financial assurance
    instruments.

While downgrades of our bond ratings may not have an immediate
    impact on our cost of debt or liquidity, they may impact our
    cost of debt and liquidity over the near to medium term. If the
    rating agencies downgrade our debt, this may increase the
    interest rate we must pay to issue new debt, and it may even
    make it prohibitively expensive for us to issue new debt. If our
    debt ratings are downgraded, future access to financial
    assurance markets at a reasonable cost, or at all, also may be
    adversely impacted.

The
    solid waste industry is a capital-intensive industry and the
    amount we spend on capital expenditures may exceed current
    expectations, which could require us to obtain additional
    funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our
    business.

Our ability to remain competitive and to grow and expand our
    operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and
    access to capital. If our capital efficiency programs are unable
    to offset the impact of inflation and business growth, it may be
    necessary to increase the amount we spend. Additionally, if we
    make acquisitions or further expand our operations, the amount
    we expend on capital, capping, closure, post-closure and
    environmental remediation expenditures will increase. Our cash
    needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping,
    closure, post-closure and remediation activities increase above
    our current estimates, which may occur over a long period due to
    changes in federal, state or local government requirements and
    other factors beyond our control. Increases in expenditures
    would negatively impact our cash flows.

Over the last several years, regulations have been adopted
    mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions. These
    regulations have caused some increases in the costs of the
    collection vehicles we buy. The EPA recently has indicated it
    intends to adopt further regulations addressing greenhouse gas
    emissions from automobiles. As a result, we could experience an
    increase in capital costs. This also could cause an increase in
    vehicle operating costs or a reduction in operating efficiency.
    We may reduce the number of vehicles we purchase until
    manufacturers adopt the new standards to increase efficiency.



We may
    be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand
    existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which could
    decrease our revenue and increase our costs.

We cannot assure you that we will successfully obtain or
    maintain the permits we require to operate our business because
    permits to operate non-hazardous solid waste landfills and to
    expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become
    more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. Permits
    often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and
    compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and
    other regulations. These permits are also often subject to
    resistance from citizen or other groups and other political
    pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent
    landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a
    permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits
    under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which
    we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for
    environmental damage. Responding to these challenges has, at
    times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with
    establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities.
    In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval
    may prohibit us from establishing new facilities, maintaining
    permits for our facilities or expanding existing facilities. Our
    failure to obtain the required permits to operate our
    non-hazardous solid waste landfills could have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results
    of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may have to
    dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors
    or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our
    landfills, either of which could significantly increase our
    waste disposal costs.

The waste industry is subject to extensive government
    regulation, and existing or future regulations may restrict our
    operations, increase our costs of operations or require us to
    make additional capital expenditures.

If we
    inadequately accrue for landfill capping, closure and
    post-closure costs, our financial condition and results of
    operations may be adversely affected.

A landfill must be closed and capped, and post-closure
    maintenance commenced, once the permitted capacity of the
    landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized.
    We have significant financial obligations relating to capping,
    closure and post-closure costs at our existing owned or operated
    landfills, and will have material financial obligations with
    respect to any future owned or operated landfills. We establish
    accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping,
    closure and post-closure financial obligations. We could
    underestimate such accruals, and our financial obligations for
    capping, closure or post-closure costs could exceed the amount
    accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds
    established for this purpose. Such a shortfall could result in
    significant unanticipated charges to income. Additionally, if a
    landfill is required to be closed earlier than expected or its
    remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason, the accruals
    for capping, closure and post-closure could be required to be
    accelerated, which could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

We
    cannot assure you that we will continue to operate our landfills
    at current volumes due to the use of alternatives to landfill
    disposal caused by state requirements or voluntary
    initiatives.

Most of the states in which we operate landfills require
    counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to
    reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through
    waste planning, composting and recycling, or other programs.
    Some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the
    source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes,
    such as yard waste, at landfills. Although such actions are
    useful in protecting our environment, these actions, as well as
    voluntary private initiatives by customers to reduce waste or
    seek disposal alternatives, have and may in the future reduce
    the volume of waste going to landfills in certain areas. If this
    occurs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our
    landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for
    landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for
    such services.



The
    possibility of landfill and transfer station site development
    projects, expansion projects or pending acquisitions not being
    completed or certain other events could result in a material
    charge to income.

We capitalize certain expenditures relating to development,
    expansion and other projects. If a facility or operation is
    permanently shut down or determined to be impaired, or a
    development or expansion project is not completed or is
    determined to be impaired, we will charge any unamortized
    capitalized expenditures to income relating to such facility or
    project that we are unable to recover through sale, transfer or
    otherwise. In future periods, we may incur charges against
    earnings in accordance with this policy, or other events may
    cause impairments. Such charges could have a material adverse
    impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

We are
    subject to costly environmental regulations and flow-control
    regulations that may affect our operating margins, restrict our
    operations and subject us to additional liability.

Complying with laws and regulations governing the use,
    treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous
    wastes and materials, air quality, water quality and the
    remediation of contamination associated with the release of
    hazardous substances is costly. Laws and regulations often
    require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify
    landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill. We
    cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price
    increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these
    laws and regulations. In addition, environmental regulatory
    changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping,
    closure and post-closure, and environmental and remediation
    activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend
    sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes.

Our collection, transfer, and landfill operations are, and may
    in the future continue to be, affected by state or local laws or
    regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste
    across state, county or other jurisdictional lines. Such laws
    and regulations could negatively affect our operations,
    resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of
    alternate disposal.

In addition to the costs of complying with environmental
    regulations, we incur costs to defend against litigation brought
    by government agencies and private parties who may allege we are
    in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws
    and regulations, or who assert claims alleging environmental
    damage, personal injury or property damage. As a result, we may
    be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures, or we
    may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked. A
    significant judgment against us, the loss of a significant
    permit or license, or the imposition of a significant fine could
    have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows. We establish
    accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our
    environmental obligations. We could underestimate such accruals
    and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued. Such
    shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to
    income.

Regulation
    of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our
    operations, the magnitude of which we cannot yet
    estimate.

Efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), to
    ameliorate the effect of climate change, continue to advance on
    the federal, regional, and state level. Our landfill operations
    emit methane, identified as a GHG. In June 2009, the
    U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would
    regulate GHGs comprehensively. While the centerpiece of that
    bill would be a GHG emission allowance

cap-and-trade

system, landfills would not be compelled to hold allowances for
    their GHG emissions. Rather, they would be subject to certain
    further emission controls to be determined through
    administrative rule-making. Senate passage of counterpart
    legislation, and whether such legislation would treat landfills
    in the same manner, is uncertain. Should comprehensive federal
    climate change legislation be enacted, we expect it to impose
    costs on our operations, the materiality of which we cannot
    predict.

Absent comprehensive federal legislation to control GHG
    emissions, EPA is moving ahead administratively under its
    existing Clean Air Act authority. In October 2009, EPA published
    a Proposed Prevention of Significant Deterioration and
    Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule (“PSD tailoring
    rule”). The proposed rule would set new thresholds for GHG
    emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits would be
    required and



would “tailor” these programs to limit which
    facilities would be required to obtain permits. EPA’s legal
    authority to “tailor” this rule in the manner it
    proposed has been challenged. If finalized as proposed, many of
    our landfills would be subject to the PSD tailoring rule, which
    could require permit amendments and additional emission
    controls. In December 2009, EPA finalized its finding that six
    GHGs endanger public health. While EPA made its finding in the
    context of regulating air emissions from motor vehicles, other
    Clean Air Act provisions appear to compel EPA to make comparable
    findings for stationary sources, such as landfills. We cannot
    predict the requirements or effective date of stationary source
    rules that might apply to landfills as a result of this
    endangerment finding and, accordingly, we cannot assure you that
    further developments in this area will not have a material
    effect on our landfill operations or on our consolidated
    financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We may
    have potential environmental liabilities that are not covered by
    our insurance. Changes in insurance markets also may impact our
    financial results.

We may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the
    environment as a result of our operations. We maintain high
    deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage.
    If we were to incur substantial liability for environmental
    damage, our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such
    liability. This could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Also, due to the variable condition of the insurance market, we
    may experience future increases in self-insurance levels as a
    result of increased retention levels and increased premiums. As
    we assume more risk for self-insurance through higher retention
    levels, we may experience more variability in our self-insurance
    reserves and expense.

Despite
    our efforts, we may incur additional hazardous substances
    liability in excess of amounts presently known and
    accrued.

We are a potentially responsible party at many sites under
    CERCLA, which provides for the remediation of contaminated
    facilities and imposes strict, joint and several liability for
    the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a
    facility at which there has been a release or a threatened
    release of a “hazardous substance,” on parties who
    were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances
    were disposed of, and on persons who arrange for the disposal of
    such substances at the facility (i.e., generators of the waste
    and transporters who selected the disposal site). Hundreds of
    substances are defined as “hazardous” under CERCLA and
    their presence, even in minute amounts, can result in
    substantial liability. Notwithstanding our efforts to comply
    with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and
    receiving hazardous substances, we may have additional liability
    under CERCLA or similar laws in excess of our current reserves
    because such substances may be present in waste collected by us
    or disposed of in our landfills, or in waste collected,
    transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have
    acquired. Actual costs for these liabilities could be
    significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these
    purposes, which could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Currently
    pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could
    result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or
    settlements.

We are, and from time to time become, involved in lawsuits,
    regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal
    proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business.
    Many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual
    and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and
    complexities. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits,
    regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal
    proceedings is uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or
    resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or
    settlements, either of which could require substantial payments,
    adversely affecting our consolidated financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.



We may
    experience difficulties completing the integration of
    Allied’s business, and we may incur unexpected expenses in
    connection with that integration.

Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger with Allied
    will depend significantly on whether we can continue to
    integrate Allied’s business in an efficient and effective
    manner. The ongoing integration may result in additional and
    unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the
    integration plan may not be fully realized. We may not be able
    to accomplish the integration process smoothly, successfully or
    on a timely basis. Any inability of our management to
    successfully and timely integrate the operations of the two
    companies could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

We may
    not realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits from
    the merger with Allied fully or within the timing
    anticipated.

We believe our merger with Allied has been and will continue to
    be beneficial to our stockholders as a result of the actual and
    anticipated synergies resulting from the combined operations.
    While we are currently ahead of our original timeline, we may
    not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost
    synergies or the long-term strategic benefits of the merger
    fully or within the timing anticipated. For example, elimination
    of duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take
    longer than anticipated. For at least the first year after an
    acquisition, and possibly longer, the benefits from the
    acquisition will be offset by the costs incurred in integrating
    the businesses and operations. The inability to realize the full
    extent of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of the
    merger, or our encountering unexpected costs or delays in the
    integration process (which may delay the timing of such
    synergies or other benefits), could have a material adverse
    effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

We may
    be unable to manage our growth effectively.

Our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial,
    operational and management resources. To continue our growth, we
    may need to add administrative and other personnel, and will
    need to make additional investments in operations and systems.
    We cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train
    qualified personnel, or do so on a timely basis, or expand our
    operations and systems to the extent, and in the time, required.

We may
    be unable to execute our acquisition growth
    strategy.

Our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on
    our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition
    candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate
    acquired operations into our business. The consolidation of our
    operations with those of acquired companies may present
    significant challenges to our management. In addition,
    competition among our competitors for acquisition candidates may
    prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates. As
    such, we cannot assure you that:

•

desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified;

•

we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified;

•

we will effectively consolidate companies we acquire; or

•

any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings.

If any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our
    growth strategy, our growth prospects could be adversely
    affected.

Businesses
    we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities.

In pursuing our acquisition strategy, our due diligence
    investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to
    discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition
    candidates. If we acquire a company having undisclosed
    liabilities such as environmental, remediation or contractual,
    as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed
    liabilities. We expect to try to minimize our exposure to such
    liabilities by



conducting due diligence, by obtaining indemnification from each
    of the sellers of the acquired companies, by deferring payment
    of a portion of the purchase price as security for the
    indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets. However,
    we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain
    indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be
    enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or
    duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising
    from our acquisitions.

Our
    consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and
    assumptions that may differ from actual results.

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP and necessarily include amounts based
    on estimates and assumptions made by management. Actual results
    could differ from these amounts. Significant items requiring
    management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters
    that are inherently uncertain include the carrying value of
    long-lived assets, the depletion and amortization of landfill
    development costs, accruals for final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs, valuation allowances for accounts receivable
    and deferred tax assets, liabilities for potential litigation,
    claims and assessments, and liabilities for environmental
    remediation, employee benefit and pension plans, deferred taxes,
    uncertain tax positions and self-insurance.

We cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for landfill
    and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the
    requirements of existing environmental regulations, future
    changes to or interpretations of existing regulations, or the
    identification of adverse environmental conditions previously
    unknown to management.

The
    introduction of new accounting rules, laws or regulations could
    adversely impact our results of operations.

Complying with new accounting rules, laws or regulations could
    adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows, or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our
    results of operations in future periods.

We may
    be subject to workforce influences, including work stoppages,
    which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our
    operations.

As of December 31, 2009, approximately 27% of our workforce
    was represented by various local labor unions. If our unionized
    workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other
    slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our
    operations and an increase in our operating costs, which could
    have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if a greater
    percentage of our workforce becomes unionized, our business and
    financial results could be materially and adversely impacted due
    to the potential for increased operating costs.

Our
    obligation to fund multi-employer pension plans to which we
    contribute may have an adverse impact on us.

We contribute to at least 25 multi-employer pension plans
    covering at least 17% of our current employees. We do not
    administer these plans and generally are not represented on the
    boards of trustees of these plans. The Pension Protection Act
    enacted in 2006 (the PPA) requires under-funded pension plans to
    improve their funding ratios. Based on the information available
    to us, we believe that some of the multi-employer plans to which
    we contribute are either “critical” or
    “endangered” as those terms are defined in the PPA. We
    cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding,
    if any, we may be required to make to these plans and,
    therefore, have not recorded any related liabilities. However,
    plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of
    operations or cash flows for a given period. Furthermore, under
    current law, upon the termination of a multi-employer pension
    plan, or in the event of a withdrawal by us (which we consider
    from time to time) or a mass withdrawal of contributing
    employers (each, a “Withdrawal Event”), we would be
    required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate
    share of the plan’s unfunded vested liabilities. We cannot
    assure you that there will not be a Withdrawal Event with
    respect to any of the multi-employer pension plans to which we
    contribute or that, in the event of such a Withdrawal Event, the
    amounts we would be



required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact
    on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows.

The
    costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding
    requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and
    fluctuating actuarial assumptions, and may have a material
    adverse impact on our results of operations and cash
    flows.

We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan which is funded with
    trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and
    equity securities. Our costs for providing such benefits and
    related funding requirements are subject to changes in the
    market value of plan assets. Our pension expenses and related
    funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial
    calculations and assumptions, which may differ materially from
    actual results due to changing market and economic conditions,
    interest rates and other factors. A significant increase in our
    pension obligations and funding requirements could have a
    material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.

The
    loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flows and growth prospects.

Our future success depends on the continued contributions of
    several key employees and officers. The loss of the services of
    key employees and officers, whether such loss is through
    resignation or other causes, or the inability to attract
    additional qualified personnel, could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash
    flows and growth prospects.

PROPERTIES

Our corporate office is located at 18500 North Allied Way,
    Phoenix, Arizona 85054, where we currently lease approximately
    145,000 square feet of office space. We also maintain
    regional administrative offices in all of our regions.

Our principal property and equipment consists of land,
    landfills, buildings, vehicles and equipment. We own or lease
    real property in the states in which we conduct operations. At
    December 31, 2009, we owned or operated 376 collection
    companies, 223 transfer stations, 192 active solid waste
    landfills and 78 recycling facilities within 40 states and
    Puerto Rico. In aggregate, our active solid waste landfills
    total approximately 97,300 acres, including approximately
    35,000 permitted acres. We also own or have responsibilities for
    132 closed landfills. We believe that our property and equipment
    are adequate for our current needs.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in routine judicial and administrative
    proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business and
    that relate to, among other things, personal injury or property
    damage claims, employment matters and commercial and contractual
    disputes. We are subject to federal, state and local
    environmental laws and regulations. Due to the nature of our
    business, we are also routinely a party to judicial or
    administrative proceedings involving governmental authorities
    and other interested parties related to environmental
    regulations or liabilities. From time to time, we may also be
    subject to actions brought by citizens’ groups, adjacent
    landowners or others in connection with the permitting and
    licensing of our landfills or transfer stations, or alleging
    personal injury, environmental damage, or violations of the
    permits and licenses pursuant to which we operate.

We are subject to various federal, state and local tax rules and
    regulations. These rules are extensive and often complex, and we
    are required to interpret and apply them to our transactions.
    Positions taken in tax filings are subject to challenge by
    taxing authorities. Accordingly, we may have exposure for
    additional tax liabilities if, upon audit, any positions taken
    are disallowed by the taxing authorities.



The following is a discussion of certain proceedings against us.
    Although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be
    predicted with certainty, except as otherwise described below,
    we do not believe that the outcome of our pending litigation,
    environmental and other administrative proceedings will have a
    material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Litigation,
    Environmental and Other Administrative Matters

Countywide
    Matters

On March 26, 2007, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
    (OEPA) issued Final Findings and Orders (F&Os) to Republic
    Services of Ohio II, LLC (Republic-Ohio), an Ohio limited
    liability company and our wholly owned subsidiary. The F&Os
    related to environmental conditions attributed to a chemical
    reaction resulting from the disposal of certain aluminum
    production waste at the Countywide Recycling and Disposal
    facility (Countywide) in East Sparta, Ohio. The F&Os, and
    certain other remedial actions Republic-Ohio agreed with the
    OEPA to undertake to address the environmental conditions,
    included, without limitation, the following actions:
    (a) prohibiting leachate recirculation, (b) refraining
    from the disposal of solid waste in certain portions of the
    site, (c) updating engineering plans and specifications and
    providing further information regarding the integrity of various
    engineered components at the site, (d) performing
    additional data collection, (e) taking additional measures
    to address emissions, (f) expanding the gas collection and
    control system, (g) installing an isolation break,
    (h) removing liquids from gas extraction wells, and
    (i) submitting a plan to the OEPA to suppress the chemical
    reaction and, following approval by the OEPA, implementing such
    plan. Republic-Ohio has performed certain interim remedial
    actions required by the OEPA. Republic-Ohio subsequently
    received additional orders from the OEPA requiring certain
    actions to be taken by Republic-Ohio, in addition to or in lieu
    of requirements contained in prior orders, including additional
    air quality monitoring and the installation and continued
    maintenance of gas well dewatering systems.

On September 30, 2009, Republic-Ohio entered into two
    legally binding agreements with the State of Ohio designed to
    further refine the activities necessary to resolve alleged
    compliance and licensing issues at the Countywide facility.

The first agreement is a Consent Order that resolves ongoing
    allegations of noncompliance at the facility and reflects
    agreements regarding the status of facility licensing. The
    allegations of noncompliance were summarized in a complaint that
    was filed by the Ohio Attorney General in the Stark County Court
    of Common Pleas and resolved the same day in accordance with
    terms of an agreed upon Consent Order entered into between
    Republic-Ohio and the State of Ohio. The Consent Order with Ohio
    requires Republic-Ohio to pay civil penalties and financial
    relief of $10.0 million, submit updated permit documents,
    and assess, evaluate, and determine the appropriate time to
    address certain compliance issues at the facility. All civil
    penalties and financial relief required by the Consent Order
    have been satisfied. Compliance with the terms of the Consent
    Order and other applicable rules will result in Countywide being
    considered to be in substantial compliance or on a legally
    enforceable schedule to return to compliance for annual
    licensing purposes.

The second agreement is a set of F&Os that were agreed to
    and entered into with the Ohio EPA. The F&Os require the
    implementation of a comprehensive operation and maintenance
    program that contains specific requirements for managing the
    remediation area. The operation and maintenance program is
    ultimately designed to result in the final capping and closure
    of the

88-acre

remediation area at Countywide. The September 30, 2009
    F&Os supersede all previous F&Os (discussed above)
    that were issued to Republic-Ohio regarding the reaction in the
    remediation area of the landfill. The operation and maintenance
    program requires Countywide to, among other things, maintain the
    temporary cap and other engineering controls designed to prevent
    odors and isolate and contain the reaction. The operation and
    maintenance program also contains provisions that require the
    installation of a composite cap in the remediation area when
    conditions become conducive to such installation.

Republic-Ohio has also entered into an Agreed Order on Consent
    (AOC) with the EPA requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred
    by the EPA and requiring Republic-Ohio to (a) design and
    install a temperature and gas monitoring system, (b) design
    and install a composite cap or cover, and (c) develop and
    implement an air monitoring program. The AOC became effective on
    April 17, 2008 and Republic-Ohio has



complied with the terms of the AOC. Republic-Ohio also has
    completed construction of an isolation break under the authority
    and supervision of the EPA and reimbursed the EPA for certain
    costs associated with the EPA’s involvement in overseeing
    implementation of the AOC. On November 20, 2009, the EPA
    issued a Notification of Completion and Determination of
    Compliance to Countywide memorializing Countywide’s
    completion of the work required under the AOC.

The Commissioner of the Stark County Health Department
    (Commissioner) previously recommended that the Stark County
    Board of Health (Board of Health) suspend Countywide’s 2007
    annual operating license. The Commissioner also intended to
    recommend that the Board of Health deny Countywide’s
    license application for 2008. Republic-Ohio obtained a
    preliminary injunction on November 28, 2007 prohibiting the
    Board of Health from suspending its 2007 operating license.
    Republic-Ohio also obtained a preliminary injunction on
    February 15, 2008 prohibiting the Board of Health from
    denying its 2008 operating license application. The litigation
    with the Board of Health has been concluded pursuant to a
    Consent Order entered into between Republic-Ohio and the Board
    of Health in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas. The Consent
    Order requires the Board of Health to issue conditional

and/or

final
    operating licenses to Countywide and requires Republic-Ohio to
    reimburse the Board of Health for certain expenses not to exceed
    $300,000 incurred related to monitoring and investigation of
    complaints regarding Countywide. Countywide’s 2009
    operating license has been challenged by Tuscarawas County, and
    the Board of Health issued Countywide its 2010 operating license
    on December 30, 2009, which also has been challenged by a
    local citizens’ group, Club 3000.

We believe that we have performed or are diligently performing
    all actions required under the F&Os, the AOC, and any
    applicable Consent Orders and that Countywide does not pose a
    threat to the environment. Additionally, we believe that we
    satisfy the rules and regulations that govern the operating
    license at Countywide.

In a suit filed on October 8, 2008 in the Tuscarawas County
    Ohio Court of Common Pleas, approximately 700 plaintiffs
    have named Republic Services, Inc. and Republic-Ohio as
    defendants. The claims alleged are negligence and nuisance and
    arise from the operation of Countywide. Republic-Ohio has owned
    and operated Countywide since February 1, 1999. Waste
    Management, Inc. and Waste Management Ohio, Inc., previous
    owners and operators of Countywide, have been named as
    defendants as well. Plaintiffs are individuals and businesses
    located in the geographic area around Countywide. They claim
    that due to the acceptance of a specific waste stream and
    operational issues and conditions, the landfill has generated
    odors and other unsafe emissions which have allegedly impaired
    the use and value of their property. There are also allegations
    that the emissions from the landfill may have adverse health
    effects. A second almost identical lawsuit was filed on
    October 13, 2009 in the Tuscarawas County Ohio Court of
    Common Pleas with approximately 82 plaintiffs. These plaintiffs
    named Republic Services, Inc., Republic-Ohio, Waste Management,
    Inc., and Waste Management Ohio, Inc. as defendants. The relief
    requested on behalf of each plaintiff in both actions is:
    (1) an award of compensatory damages according to proof in
    an amount in excess of $25,000 for each of the three counts of
    the amended complaint; (2) an award of punitive damages in
    the amount of two times compensatory damages, pursuant to
    applicable statute, or in such amount as may be awarded at trial
    for each of the three counts of the amended complaint,
    (3) costs for medical screening and monitoring of each
    plaintiff; (4) interest on the damages according to law;
    (5) costs and disbursements of the lawsuit;
    (6) reasonable fees for attorneys and expert witnesses; and
    (7) any other and further relief as the court deems just,
    proper and equitable. We anticipate that the two cases will be
    consolidated. Answers have been filed in both cases and
    discovery is ongoing. 164 plaintiffs in the first case and 41
    plaintiffs in the second case have been dismissed or are in the
    process of being dismissed for failing to comply with discovery.
    We intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs’
    allegations in both actions.

Luri
    Matter

On August 17, 2007, a lawsuit was filed by a former
    employee, Ronald Luri v. Republic Services, Inc., Republic
    Services of Ohio Hauling LLC, Republic Services of Ohio I LLC,
    Jim Bowen and Ron Krall in the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas
    Court in Ohio. On July 3, 2008, a jury verdict was awarded
    against us in the amount of $46.6 million, including
    $43.1 million in punitive damages. On September 24,
    2008, the Court awarded pre-judgment interest of
    $0.3 million and attorney fees and litigation costs of
    $1.1 million. Post-



judgment interest accrued at a rate of 8% for 2008 and 5% for
    2009, and is accruing at a rate of 4% for 2010. Management
    anticipates that post-judgment interest could accrue through the
    middle of 2011 for a total of $7.7 million. Post-judgment
    motions filed on our behalf and certain of our subsidiaries were
    denied, and on October 1, 2008, we filed a notice of
    appeal. The parties submitted their appeal briefs and oral
    argument was scheduled for October 27, 2009. On
    October 23, 2009, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal
    holding that the trial court had not entered a final, appealable
    order. The case has been returned to the trial court for
    additional proceedings which may include entry of additional
    order(s) by the trial court followed by another appeal. It is
    reasonably possible that following all appeals a final judgment
    of liability for compensatory and punitive damages may be
    assessed against us related to this matter. Although it is not
    possible to predict the ultimate outcome, management believes
    that the amount of any final, non-appealable judgment will not
    be material.

Forward
    Matters

The District Attorney for San Joaquin County filed a civil
    action against Forward, Inc. and Allied Waste Industries, Inc.
    on February 14, 2008 in the Superior Court of California,
    County of San Joaquin. Forward and Allied each filed
    answers in November 2008, denying all material allegations of
    the complaint. The complaint seeks civil penalties of $2,500 for
    each alleged violation, but no less than $10.0 million, and
    an injunction against Forward and Allied for alleged permit and
    regulatory violations at the Forward Landfill. The District
    Attorney contends that the alleged violations constitute unfair
    business practices under the California Business and Professions
    Code section 17200, et seq., by virtue of violations of
    Public Resources Code Division 30, Part 4,
    Chapter 3, Article 1, sections 44004 and
    44014(b); California Code of Regulations Title 27,
    Chapter 3, Subchapter 4, Article 6,
    sections 20690(11) and 20919.5; and Health and Safety Code
    sections 25200, 25100, et seq., and 25500, et seq. Although
    the complaint is worded very broadly and does not identify
    specific permit or regulatory violations, the District Attorney
    has articulated three primary concerns in past communications,
    alleging that the landfill: (1) used green waste containing
    food as alternative daily cover, (2) exceeded its daily
    solid waste tonnage receipt limitations under its solid waste
    facility permit, and (3) received hazardous waste in
    violation of its permit (i.e., auto shredder waste).
    Additionally, it is alleged that the landfill allowed a
    concentration of methane gas in excess of five percent.
    Discovery is currently underway. We are vigorously defending
    against the allegations.

On February 5, 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) Region IX delivered a Finding and Notice of
    Violation to the Forward Landfill as a result of alleged
    violations of the Title V permit issued under the Clean Air
    Act. The facility is jointly regulated by the EPA and the
    San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. The
    alleged violations include operating gas collection wellheads at
    greater than 15% oxygen, experiencing a subsurface oxidation
    event on multiple occasions, and submitting inaccurate
    compliance certifications. We have requested a conference with
    the agencies and intend to vigorously defend against the
    allegations.

Carbon
    Limestone Matter

On May 4, 2009, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
    (OEPA) issued Proposed Findings and Orders (F&Os) to Carbon
    Limestone Landfill, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary. The
    proposed F&Os allege violations regarding the acceptance of
    hazardous waste from two customers and issues regarding the
    site’s leachate management collection system and
    groundwater monitoring program, and seek corrective actions and
    a civil penalty of $155,311. After negotiations with OEPA, on
    December 15, 2009, Carbon Limestone Landfill, LLC and the
    OEPA agreed to a Director’s Findings and Final Order (DFFO)
    specifying a schedule of corrective actions and a civil penalty
    of $73,846, comprised of a single payment of $59,077, and
    funding of a supplemental environmental project costing $14,769.
    We have commenced payment and instituting the corrective actions
    as required by the DFFO.

Litigation
    Related to Fuel and Environmental Fees

On July 8, 2009, CLN Properties, Inc. and Maevers
    Management Company, Inc., filed a complaint against the Company
    and one of its subsidiaries in the United States District Court
    in Arizona, in which plaintiffs



complain about fuel recovery fees and environmental recovery
    fees charged by the Company or one of its subsidiaries. On
    July 23, 2009, Klingler’s European Bake
    Shop & Deli, Inc., filed a complaint against the
    Company and one of its subsidiaries in the Circuit Court of
    Jefferson County, Alabama, in which plaintiff complains about
    fuel/environmental recovery fees and administrative fees charged
    by the Company or one of its subsidiaries. The CLN
    Properties/Maevers complaint, which the plaintiffs amended on
    August 31, 2009, purports to be filed on behalf of a
    nationwide class of similarly-situated plaintiffs, while the
    Klingler’s complaint purports to be filed on behalf of a
    class of similarly situated plaintiffs in Alabama. Each
    complaint asserts various legal and equitable theories of
    recovery and alleges in essence that the fees were not properly
    disclosed, were unfair, and were contrary to contract. We filed
    motions to dismiss in both actions. On January 13, 2010,
    the court in the CLN/Maevers case granted our motion to dismiss
    in part and denied it in part. Plaintiff in the Klingler’s
    case voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice on
    October 23, 2009 and subsequently re-filed a virtually
    identical complaint against a different subsidiary of the
    company on November 20, 2009. We recently moved to dismiss
    this new complaint. We will continue to vigorously defend the
    claims in both lawsuits.

Imperial
    Landfill Matter

On May 18, 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of
    Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the Allegheny County Health
    Department issued to the Imperial Landfill a proposed consent
    order and agreement for a series of alleged violations related
    to landfill gas, leachate control, cover management, and
    resulting nuisance odor complaints in late 2008 and 2009. PADEP
    subsequently issued additional notices of violation for similar
    alleged violations. The combined penalties proposed by the
    agencies total approximately $1 million. We are engaging in
    ongoing discussions with the agencies to reach a negotiated
    settlement, and have been aggressively working to correct any
    issues alleged in the order.

Litigation
    Related to the Merger with Allied

On December 3, 2008, the DOJ and seven state attorneys
    general filed a complaint, Hold Separate Stipulation and Order,
    and competitive impact statement, together with a proposed final
    judgment, in the United States District Court for the District
    of Columbia, in connection with approval under the HSR Act of
    our merger with Allied. The court entered the Hold Separate
    Stipulation and Order on December 4, 2008, which terminated
    the waiting period under the HSR Act and allowed the parties to
    close the transaction subject to the conditions described in the
    Hold Separate Stipulation and Order. These conditions include
    the divestiture of certain assets which were completed by
    September 30, 2009. However, the final judgment can only be
    approved by the court after the DOJ publishes a notice in the
    Federal Register and considers comments it receives. During this
    period, if the DOJ believes that the final judgment is no longer
    in the public interest, the DOJ may withdraw its support of the
    final judgment and seek to prevent the final judgment from
    becoming final in its present form. Likewise, the court may, in
    its discretion, modify the divestitures or other relief sought
    by the DOJ if the court believes that such modification is in
    the public interest. On July 16, 2009, the DOJ and the
    seven state attorneys general filed a motion seeking entry of
    the proposed final judgment. The precise timing for the
    confirmation of the final judgment is not known. Management
    believes that the court will enter the final judgment and that
    modifications to the final judgment, if any, will not be
    material.

Proxy
    Disclosure Matter

In late 2009, a Republic stockholder brought a lawsuit in
    Federal court in Delaware challenging our disclosures in our
    2009 proxy statement with respect to the Executive Incentive
    Plan (“EIP”) that was approved by our stockholders at
    the 2009 annual meeting. The lawsuit is styled as a combined
    proxy disclosure claim and derivative action. We are a defendant
    only with respect to the proxy disclosure claim, which seeks
    only to require us to make additional disclosures regarding the
    EIP and to hold a new stockholder vote prior to making any
    payments under the EIP. The derivative claim is purportedly
    brought on behalf of our company against all of our directors
    and the individuals who were executive officers at the time of
    the 2009 annual meeting and alleges, among other things, breach
    of fiduciary duty. That claim also seeks injunctive relief and
    seeks to recoup on behalf of our company an unspecified amount
    of the incentive compensation that may be



paid to our executives under the EIP, as well as the amount of
    any tax deductions that may be lost if the EIP does not comply
    with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. We
    believe the lawsuit is without merit and is not material and
    intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiff’s
    allegations.

Contracting
    Matter

We recently discovered actions of non-compliance by one of our
    subsidiaries with the subcontracting provisions of certain
    government contracts in one of our markets. We reported the
    discovery to, and expect further discussions with, law
    enforcement authorities. Such non-compliance could result in
    payments by us in the form of restitution, damages, or
    penalties, or the loss of future business. Based on the
    information currently available to us, including our expectation
    that our self-disclosure will be viewed favorably by the
    applicable authorities, we presently believe that the resolution
    of the matter, while it may have a material impact on our
    results of operations or cash flows in the period in which it is
    recognized or paid, will not have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial position.

Congress
    Development Landfill Matters

Congress Development Co. (CDC) is a general partnership
    that owns and operates the Congress Landfill. The general
    partners in CDC are our subsidiary, Allied Waste Transportation,
    Inc. (Allied Transportation), and an unaffiliated entity, John
    Sexton Sand & Gravel Corporation (Sexton). Sexton was
    the operator of the landfill through early 2007, when Allied
    Transportation took over as the operator. The general partners
    likely will be jointly and severally liable for the costs
    associated with the following matters relating to the Congress
    Landfill.

In January 2006, CDC was issued an Agreed Preliminary Injunction
    and Order by the Circuit Court of Illinois, Cook County.
    Subsequently, the court issued two additional Supplemental
    Orders that required CDC to implement certain remedial actions
    at the Congress Landfill, which remedial actions are underway.

In a suit originally filed on December 23, 2009 in the
    Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois and subsequently amended
    to add additional plaintiffs, approximately 1,000 plaintiffs
    sued our subsidiaries Allied Transportation and Allied Waste
    Industries, Inc., CDC and Sexton. The plaintiffs allege bodily
    injury, property damage and inability to have normal use and
    enjoyment of property arising from, among other things, odors
    and other damages arising from landfill gas leaking, and they
    base their claims on negligence, trespass, and nuisance. The
    plaintiffs have requested actual damages in excess of
    $50 million and punitive damages of $50 million. We
    intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs’
    allegations in this action. We cannot at this time predict the
    ultimate outcome of this matter or the reasonably probable loss,
    if any.

Livingston
    Matter

On October 13, 2009, the Twenty-First Judicial District
    Court, Parish of Livingston, State of Louisiana, issued its Post
    Class Certification Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
    in a lawsuit alleging nuisance from the activities of the CECOS
    hazardous waste facility located in Livingston Parish,
    Louisiana. The court granted class certification for all those
    living within a six mile radius of the CECOS site between the
    years 1977 and 1990. The site last accepted waste in June 1990.
    The class certification order remains subject to appeal, and we
    intend to continue to defend this lawsuit vigorously.

Sunshine
    Canyon Matter

On November 17, 2009, the South Coast Air Quality
    Management District (District) issued an Order for Abatement as
    a result of a series of odor complaints alleged to be associated
    with the operations at the Sunshine Canyon Landfill located in
    Sylmar, California. The Order describes eight notices of
    violation beginning in November 2008 and continuing to November
    2009. The District Hearing Board held a compliance hearing on
    December 17, 2009, at which we described the measures to
    mitigate the odors. A final order and settlement document has
    not been issued.



Tax
    Matters

We and our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the
    U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as income tax in multiple
    state jurisdictions. We have acquired Allied’s open tax
    periods as part of the acquisition. Allied is currently under
    examination or administrative review by various state and
    federal taxing authorities for certain tax years, including
    federal income tax audits for calendar years 2000 through 2007.
    Prior to the merger, the IRS had commenced an examination of our
    2005 through 2007 tax years and this exam is currently ongoing.
    In 2009, the IRS opened an examination of our 2008 tax year. We
    are also under state examination in various jurisdictions for
    various tax years. These audits are ongoing.

Risk
    Management Companies

Prior to Allied’s acquisition of Browning Ferris Industries
    (BFI) in July 1999, certain BFI operating companies, as part of
    a risk management initiative to manage and reduce costs
    associated with certain liabilities, contributed assets and
    existing environmental and self-insurance liabilities to six
    fully consolidated BFI risk management companies (RMCs) in
    exchange for stock representing a minority ownership interest in
    the RMCs. Subsequently, the BFI operating companies sold that
    stock in the RMCs to third parties at fair market value which
    resulted in a capital loss of approximately $902 million
    for tax purposes, calculated as the excess of the tax basis of
    the stock over the cash proceeds received.

On January 18, 2001, the IRS designated this type of
    transaction and other similar transactions as a
    “potentially abusive tax shelter” under IRS
    regulations. During 2002, the IRS proposed the disallowance of
    all of this capital loss. In April 2005, the Appeals Office of
    the IRS upheld the disallowance of the capital loss deduction
    with respect to BFI tax years prior to the acquisition. In July
    2005, Allied filed a suit for refund in the United States Court
    of Federal Claims (CFC) relating to the BFI tax years. In
    January 2009, we paid all tax, interest and penalty asserted by
    the IRS with respect to the BFI tax years and withdrew our suit
    for refund in the CFC.

In August 2008, Allied received from the IRS a Statutory Notice
    of Deficiency related to its utilization of BFI’s capital
    loss carryforward on Allied’s 1999 tax return. In October
    2008, Allied filed a suit for refund in federal district court
    in Arizona with respect to Allied’s 1999 tax year. In
    December 2009, we reached a settlement with both the DOJ and IRS
    for Allied’s 1999 tax year and all subsequent tax years.
    Under the settlement, the company resolved all remaining
    liability for this matter (including federal and state tax,
    penalty and interest) for approximately $125 million. We
    paid approximately $58 million in the first quarter of 2010
    and expect to pay the remainder, approximately $67 million,
    later in 2010. While the final settlement amount is less than
    the amount previously accrued for this matter, the accrual and
    the adjustment thereto are reflected in our allocation of
    purchase price associated with the acquisition of Allied and had
    no impact on our consolidated statement of income.

Exchange
    of Partnership Interests

In April 2002, Allied exchanged minority partnership interests
    in four

waste-to-energy

facilities for majority partnership interests in equipment
    purchasing businesses, which are now wholly owned subsidiaries.
    In November 2008, the IRS issued a formal disallowance to Allied
    contending that the exchange was instead a sale on which a
    corresponding gain should have been recognized. We believe our
    position is supported by relevant technical authorities and
    strong business purpose and we intend to vigorously defend our
    position on this matter. Although we intend to vigorously defend
    our position on this matter, if the exchange is treated as a
    sale, we estimate it could have a potential federal and state
    cash tax impact of approximately $156 million plus accrued
    interest through December 31, 2009 of approximately
    $59 million. In addition, the IRS has asserted a penalty of
    20% of the additional income tax due. The potential tax and
    interest (but not penalty or penalty-related interest) of a full
    adjustment for this matter have been fully reserved in our
    consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. The
    successful assertion by the IRS of penalty and penalty-related
    interest in connection with this matter could have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and
    cash flows.



Methane
    Gas

As part of its examination of Allied’s 2000 through 2006
    federal income tax returns, the IRS reviewed Allied’s
    treatment of costs associated with its landfill operations. As a
    result of this review, the IRS has proposed that certain
    landfill costs be allocated to the collection and control of
    methane gas that is naturally produced within the landfill. The
    IRS’ position is that the methane gas produced by a
    landfill is a joint product resulting from operation of the
    landfill and, therefore, these costs should not be expensed
    until the methane gas is sold or otherwise disposed.

We have protested this matter to the Appeals Office of the IRS.
    We believe we have several meritorious defenses, including the
    fact that methane gas is not actively produced for sale by us
    but rather arises naturally in the context of providing disposal
    services. Therefore, we believe that the subsequent resolution
    of this issue will not have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In February 2010, our Board of Directors declared a regular
    quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share for stockholders of record
    on April 1, 2010. We expect to continue to pay quarterly
    cash dividends, and we may consider increasing our quarterly
    cash dividends if we believe it will enhance shareholder value.

We have the ability under our credit facilities to pay dividends
    and repurchase our common stock subject to our compliance with
    the financial covenants in our credit facilities. As of
    December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the financial
    covenants of our credit facilities.



Issuer
    Purchases of Equity Securities

From 2000 through 2009, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $2.6 billion of our common stock. As of
    December 31, 2009, we had paid $2.3 billion to
    repurchase 82.6 million shares of our common stock. We
    suspended our share repurchase program in the second quarter of
    2008 due to the pending merger with Allied. We expect that our
    share repurchase program will continue to be suspended until
    approximately 2011. The following table provides information

SELECTED
    FINANCIAL DATA

The following Selected Financial Data should be read in
    conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes
    thereto as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 and
    Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations

included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our merger with Allied was effective December 5, 2008 and
    has been accounted for as an acquisition of Allied by Republic.
    The consolidated financial statements include the operating
    results of Allied from the date of the acquisition, and have not
    been retroactively restated to include Allied’s historical
    financial position or results of operations. In accordance with
    the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid has
    been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon
    their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the
    excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being
    recorded as goodwill.

Our shares, per share data and weighted average common and
    common equivalent shares outstanding have been retroactively
    adjusted for all periods prior to 2007 to reflect a

3-for-2

stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was effective
    on March 16, 2007.

See Notes 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10 and 12 of the notes to our
    consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for a discussion of basis of presentation, significant
    accounting policies, business acquisitions and divestitures,
    assets held for sale, restructuring charges, landfill and
    environmental costs, debt, income taxes and stockholders’
    equity and their effect on comparability of

year-to-year

data. These historical results are not necessarily indicative of
    the results to be expected in the future (in millions, except
    per share amounts).

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
    our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes
    thereto, included elsewhere herein. This discussion may contain
    forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on
    management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We
    discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual
    results to differ from expectations in Item 1A. Risk
    Factors.

Overview
    of Our Business

We are the second largest provider of services in the domestic
    non-hazardous solid waste industry, as measured by revenue. We
    provide non-hazardous solid waste collection services for
    commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers
    through 376 collection companies in 40 states and Puerto
    Rico. We own or operate 223 transfer stations, 192 active solid
    waste landfills and 78 recycling facilities. We also operate
    74 landfill gas and renewable energy projects. We completed
    our merger with Allied Waste Industries, Inc. (Allied) in
    December 2008. We believe that this merger creates a strong
    operating platform that will allow us to continue to provide
    quality service to our customers and superior returns to our
    stockholders.

Despite the challenging economic environment, our business
    performed well during 2009 due in large part to the
    indispensable nature of our services and the scalability of our
    business. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009
    increased by 122.5% to $8.2 billion compared to
    $3.7 billion during the comparable period in 2008. This
    increase in revenue is attributable to our merger with Allied.
    Assuming our merger with Allied occurred on January 1,
    2008, and the revenue associated with the related divestitures
    is eliminated in the period the assets were sold along with the
    comparable prior year period, core revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 would have decreased 10.7% consisting of
    a 3.0% increase in core price offset by decreases of 9.5% in
    core volume, 2.5% in fuel charges and 1.7% in commodity price.
    The core price increase, together with cost control steps taken
    by our operations management to scale the business down for
    lower volumes, served to moderate profit margin declines
    associated with rising costs and declining revenue resulting
    from decreases in service volumes.

    Business Initiatives

We expect that the economic challenges we experienced during the
    latter part of 2008 and all of 2009 will extend into 2010. We
    anticipate continued

year-over-year

decreases in volumes in all lines of our business. However, we
    believe that we will continue to benefit from our cost control
    and pricing initiatives. Our business is capital intensive.
    Slower growth allows us to reduce capital spending, thus
    maintaining strong free cash flow despite a weaker economy. In
    addition, our attention is focused on completing the integration
    of our newly merged company, achieving cost synergies and
    pursuing other revenue enhancing and cost reduction
    opportunities.



Our business initiatives for 2010 focus on completing the
    integration of our operations with Allied’s, while
    remaining focused on the aspects of our operations that have
    made us successful. Our initiatives include:

•

Safety.

Safety remains our highest priority for all
    of our employees. Republic has a long-standing commitment to
    ensuring a safe working environment for our employees. Our
    commitment to safety is unwavering and is evident in our mission
    statement. We will continue to foster a safe work environment
    for our employees and the communities that we service. In
    addition, we will continue to reward our people for operating in
    a safe and conscientious manner.

•

Service Delivery.

We believe that our focus on
    service delivery differentiates us from others in the waste
    management industry. During 2010, we will continue to exceed our
    customers’ expectations through the consistent delivery of
    high quality service. We will also focus on increasing the
    efficiency of our service delivery. We believe that our
    attention to efficient delivery of high quality customer service
    will enhance customer retention.

•

Synergy Capture.

Prior to the effective date of our
    merger with Allied, we identified $150 million of annual
    run-rate integration synergies. We also developed a detailed
    plan for realizing this goal that includes participation at all
    levels throughout the company from the drivers of our fleet of
    collection vehicles to our board of directors. This plan
    anticipated achieving $100 million of annual run-rate
    integration synergies by the end of fiscal 2009. As of
    December 31, 2009, we have already met our original goal of
    $150 million of run-rate synergies and have increased our
    total goal for annual run-rate synergies to $165 to
    $175 million. We expect to achieve this goal by the end of
    2010. We also expect to spend approximately $34 million in
    one-time costs during 2010 directly attributable to achieving
    our synergy goal.

•

Other Opportunities.

With our synergy goals well
    within our reach, during 2010 we intend to redirect our
    attention to other opportunities that were identified during our
    synergy planning discussions, but were assigned a lower
    priority. These opportunities include enhancing pricing systems
    and return on investment models, standardizing prospecting,
    sales reporting and disposal optimization tools, standardizing
    repair and maintenance procedures, developing a new operating
    platform for our national accounts program to ensure customer
    satisfaction, and consolidating and standardizing our customer
    call centers. We believe that these initiatives will provide our
    company with substantial earnings benefit when they are fully
    implemented.

•

Return on Invested Capital.

Enhancing our return on
    invested capital is the culmination of all our 2010 initiatives.
    We will maintain our focus on disciplined growth and investing
    in our business to ensure increasing returns on invested capital
    and shareholder value.

Recent
    Developments

In the first quarter of 2010, we notified the registered holders
    of our 6.125% Senior Notes due 2014 (the 6.125% Senior
    Notes) that we will redeem all of the notes outstanding in March
    2010. The 6.125% Senior Notes will be redeemed at a price
    equal to 102.042% of the principal amount, of which
    $425.0 million is outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid
    interest. We expect to incur a charge upon extinguishment of the
    6.125% Senior Notes of approximately $52 million. We
    expect this charge will be reflected in our first quarter 2010
    financial results.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we notified the registered
    holders of our 7.875% Senior Notes due 2013, our
    4.250% Senior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2034
    and our 7.375% Senior Notes due 2014 that we will redeem
    all of the notes outstanding in November and December of 2009.
    The 7.875% Senior Notes due 2013 were redeemed at 102.625%,
    the 4.250% Senior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due
    2034 were redeemed at par and the 7.375% Senior Notes due
    2014 were redeemed at 103.688%. With respect to these
    redemptions, as well as additional secondary market repurchases
    of our senior notes, we incurred a fourth quarter loss on
    extinguishment of debt of $102.3 million. Additionally, in
    September 2009, we purchased and retired $325.5 million of
    our outstanding senior notes maturing in 2010 and 2011 resulting
    in a third quarter loss on extinguishment of debt of
    $31.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009,
    total loss on extinguishment of debt was $134.1 million.



The repayment of the senior notes was primarily funded by the
    issuance of $650.0 million of 5.500% Senior Notes due
    2019 and $600.0 million of 5.250% Senior Notes due
    2021 in two separate private placement transactions. The notes
    are general senior unsecured obligations of our parent company.
    The notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also
    guarantee our Credit Facilities. These guarantees are general
    senior unsecured obligations of the subsidiary guarantors. In
    addition, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreements with
    the representatives of the initial purchasers of the notes.
    Under the Registration Rights Agreements, we agreed to use our
    reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a
    registration statement to exchange the notes for freely tradable
    notes issued by us. If we are unable to effect the exchange
    offer within 365 days, we agreed to pay additional interest
    on the notes.

In the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain
    portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates
    using cash from operations or additional borrowings. We may also
    explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions
    should market conditions be favorable. The early extinguishment
    of debt may result in an impairment charge in the period in
    which the debt is repurchased and retired. The loss on early
    extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate
    the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note
    discounts and debt issue costs.

Business
    Acquisitions and Divestitures

We make decisions to acquire, invest in or divest of businesses
    based on financial and strategic considerations. Businesses
    acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of
    accounting and are included in our consolidated financial
    statements from the date of acquisition.

Merger
    with Allied Waste Industries, Inc.

On December 5, 2008, we acquired all the issued and
    outstanding shares of Allied in a

stock-for-stock

transaction for an aggregate purchase price of
    $12.1 billion, which included approximately
    $5.4 billion of debt, at fair value. We completed our
    purchase price allocation for this acquisition during 2009.
    Adjustments, if any, after the allocation period made to the
    valuation of assets and liabilities acquired will be recorded in
    the consolidated statement of income in the period in which such
    adjustments become known. All of the approximate
    $9.7 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets
    resulting from the acquisition will be non-deductible for income
    tax purposes.

As a condition of the merger with Allied in December 2008, the
    Department of Justice (DOJ) required us to divest of certain
    assets and related liabilities. As such, we classified these
    assets and liabilities as assets held for sale in our
    consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008. As of
    December 31, 2009, we have completed our required
    divestitures and we recognized a net gain on disposition of our
    legacy Republic net assets of $153.5 million.

As a result of our acquisition of Allied, we committed to a
    restructuring plan related to our corporate overhead and other
    administrative and operating functions. The plan included
    closing our corporate office in Florida, consolidating
    administrative functions to Arizona, the former headquarters of
    Allied, and reducing staffing levels. The plan also included
    closing and consolidating certain operating locations and
    terminating certain leases. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we incurred $63.2 million of
    restructuring and integration charges related to our integration
    of Allied, of which $34.0 million consists of charges for
    severance and other employee termination and relocation
    benefits. The remainder of the charges primarily related to
    consulting and professional fees. Substantially all the charges
    are recorded in our corporate segment. During 2010, we expect to
    incur additional charges approximating $12 million to
    complete our plan. We expect that the majority of these charges
    will be paid during 2010 and extend into 2011. As a result of
    our integration activities, we expect to achieve
    $165 million to $175 million of annual run-rate
    synergies by the end of 2010.

Other
    Business Acquisitions and Divestitures

In October 2009, we divested a hauling operation in Miami-Dade
    County, Florida and received proceeds of $32.7 million and
    recognized a loss of $10.2 million.



In addition to the acquisition of Allied in December 2008, we
    acquired various other solid waste businesses during the years
    ended December 31, 2008, and 2007. The aggregate purchase
    price we paid for these transactions was $13.4 million and
    $4.4 million, respectively.

In November 2007, we divested of our Texas-based compost, mulch
    and soil business and received proceeds of $36.5 million. A
    gain of $12.5 million was recorded in 2007 on this
    divestiture.

Loss on extinguishment of debt.

During the third and
    fourth quarters of 2009 we issued $1,250.0 million of
    senior notes, the proceeds of which were primarily used to
    purchase and retire outstanding senior notes maturing in 2010
    through 2034. Additionally, we repurchased certain of our
    outstanding senior notes in the secondary market.



Restructuring charges.

During 2009 and the fourth
    quarter of 2008, we incurred $63.2 million and
    $82.7 million, respectively, of restructuring and
    integration charges related to our merger with Allied. These
    charges consist of severance and other employee termination and
    relocation benefits as well as consulting and professional fees.
    Substantially all of these charges were recorded in our
    “Corporate entities” segment.

Costs to achieve synergies.

During 2009 and the
    fourth quarter of 2008, we incurred $41.8 million and
    $2.9 million, respectively, of incremental costs to achieve
    our synergy plans. These incremental costs primarily relate to a
    synergy incentive plan as well as other integration costs. In
    2010, we expect that we will continue to accrue approximately
    $34 million for our synergy incentive plan.

(Gain) loss on disposition of assets and impairments,
    net.

During 2009, we recorded (gain) loss on
    disposition of assets, net of costs to sell of
    $(137.0) million related to the mandatory disposition of
    assets as required by DOJ as well as discretionary dispositions.
    During 2008, we recorded asset impairments of $89.8 million
    primarily related to our Countywide facility, our former
    corporate office in Florida and expected losses on sales of DOJ
    required divestitures.

Remediation (recoveries) charges.

During 2009, we
    recovered $(12.0) million of insurance proceeds related to
    remediation costs at our Countywide facility, which were
    partially offset by additional charges of $5.2 million at
    our closed disposal facility in California. Remediation and
    related charges of $156.8 million during 2008 were
    attributable to changes to our cost estimates at our Countywide
    facility, our closed disposal facility in California, and the
    Sunrise Landfill in Nevada.

Tax effect of permanent items in adjustments.

During
    2008, our effective tax rate was impacted by several expenses
    associated with the merger that were not tax deductible.

In addition we incurred the following charges for the year ended
    December 31, 2008:

•

Conforming adjustments for accounting
    policies.

During 2008, we recorded bad debt expense of
    $14.2 million related to conforming Allied’s
    methodology for recording the allowance for doubtful accounts
    for accounts receivable with our methodology and
    $5.4 million to provide for specific bankruptcy exposures.

•

Legal reserves.

During 2008, we incurred
    $24.3 million of charges related to our estimates of the
    outcome of various legal matters.

•

Landfill amortization.

During 2008, we recorded
    $2.8 million of incremental landfill amortization expense
    as compared to the amortization expense Allied would have
    recorded for the same period.

We believe that the presentation of adjusted pre-tax income,
    adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. and
    adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures
    determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provide an
    understanding of operational activities before the financial
    impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe
    investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing
    performance of our operations separate from items that have a
    disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period.
    Comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior
    periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be
    expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of
    adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to
    Republic Services, Inc. and adjusted diluted earnings per share
    may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by
    other companies.



These gains and charges affected our consolidated statements of

Revenue

We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection
    operations. Our remaining revenue is from other services
    including landfill disposal and recycling. Our revenue from
    collection operations consists of fees we receive from
    commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Our
    residential and commercial collection operations in some markets
    are based on long-term contracts with municipalities. Certain of
    our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses
    that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the
    consumer price index. We generally provide commercial and
    industrial collection services to individual customers under
    contracts with terms up to three years. Our transfer station,
    landfill and to a lesser extent our material recovery facilities
    generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third
    parties. In general, we integrate our recycling operations with
    our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of
    recyclable materials. Other revenue consists primarily of
    revenue from sales of recycled materials and revenue from
    national accounts acquired from Allied. National accounts
    revenue included in other revenue represents the portion of
    revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside
    our operating areas, and, as such, the associated waste handling
    services are subcontracted to local operators. Consequently,
    substantially all of this revenue is offset with related
    subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations. No
    one customer has individually accounted for more than 5% of our
    consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any
    of the periods presented.

We believe that the preceding presentation of adjusted revenue
    and changes in adjusted revenue provides useful information to
    investors because it allows investors to understand increases or
    decreases in our revenue that are driven by changes in the
    operations of the newly combined company and not merely by the
    addition of Allied’s revenues for periods after the merger.
    This information has been prepared for illustrative purposes and
    is not intended to be indicative of the revenue that would have
    been realized had the merger been consummated at the beginning
    of the periods presented or the future results of the combined
    operations.

Revenue –
    2009 versus 2008

Revenue was $8,199.1 million and $3,685.1 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively,
    an increase of $4,514.0 million or 122.5%. This increase is
    due to the acquisition of Allied in December 2008.

•

Changes in core price increased revenue by 3.0% and 4.4% in 2009
    and 2008, respectively, due to our broad-based pricing
    initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003.
    We anticipate that we will continue to realize this benefit
    throughout 2010.

•

Changes in fuel surcharges decreased revenue by 2.5% in 2009
    compared to an increase of 1.8% in 2008. Revenue benefited from
    fuel surcharges resulting from high fuel costs that were passed
    along to our customers during 2008. The decline in fuel
    surcharges in 2009 compared to 2008 is directly attributable to
    a decline in fuel costs.

•

Changes in commodity prices decreased revenue by 1.7% in 2009
    compared to an increase of 0.1% in 2008. During 2009, lower
    market demand resulted in lower pricing for the commodities we
    sell.



•

Changes in core volume decreased revenue by 9.5% and 3.8% in
    2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, we experienced
    negative core volume growth in all lines of business, especially
    in our industrial collection and landfill businesses, as a
    result of the challenging economic environment. We expect to
    continue to experience

year-over-year

volume declines until economic conditions improve.

Revenue –
    2008 versus 2007

Revenue was $3,685.1 million and $3,176.2 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
    an increase of $508.9 million or 16.0% primarily due to the
    acquisition of Allied in December 2008.

•

Changes in core price increased revenue by 4.4% in 2008 and
    2007, respectively, due to our broad-based pricing initiative
    which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003.

•

Changes in fuel surcharges increased revenue by 1.8% and 0.2% in
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Revenue benefited from fuel
    surcharges due to high fuel costs that were passed along to our
    customers. The increase in fuel surcharges in 2008 compared to
    2007 is directly attributable to an increase in fuel costs.

•

Changes in commodity prices increased revenue by 0.1% and 0.9%
    in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decline in revenue growth is
    primarily due to a decline in global demand.

•

Changes in core volume decreased revenue by 3.8% and 1.6% in
    2008 and 2007, respectively, due to decreases across all lines
    of business as a result of the slowdown in the economy in 2008.

Revenue –
    2010 Outlook

We anticipate internal revenue from core operations to decrease
    approximately 0.5% - 2.0% during 2010. This decrease
    consists of expected growth in core pricing of approximately
    2.0% - 2.5% offset by an expected decline in volume of
    approximately 3.0% - 4.0%. Our projections assume no
    deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that
    experienced at the end of 2009. However, our internal growth may
    be more or less than expected in 2010 depending on economic
    conditions and our success in implementing pricing initiatives.

Cost
    of Operations

Cost of operations was $4,844.2 million,
    $2,416.7 million and $2,003.9 million, or, as a
    percentage of revenue, 59.1%, 65.6% and 63.1%, for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars for the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 versus the year
    ended December 31, 2007 is a result of our acquisition of
    Allied in December 2008.

Cost of operations includes labor and related benefits, which
    consists of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits,
    incentive compensation and payroll taxes. It also includes
    transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to
    third party disposal facilities and transfer stations;
    maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment and
    containers, including related labor and benefit costs;
    transportation and subcontractor costs, which include costs for
    independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal
    facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste
    handling services associated with our national accounts in
    markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which
    includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of
    fuel credits; disposal franchise fees and taxes consisting of
    landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees
    and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes landfill
    accretion, financial assurance, leachate disposal and other
    landfill maintenance costs; risk management, which includes
    casualty insurance premiums and claims; cost of goods sold,
    which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with
    recycling commodities; and other, which includes expenses such
    as facility operating costs, equipment rent and gains or losses
    on sale of assets used in our operations.



The following table summarizes the major components of our cost
    of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our

    our cost of operations by cost component to that of other
    companies.

Cost of
    Operations – 2009 versus 2008

Our cost of operations, as a percentage of revenue, improved
    6.5% to 59.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared
    to 65.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as
    a result of the following:

•

Transfer and disposal costs decreased as a percentage of revenue
    primarily due to lower fuel and disposal costs. In addition,
    transfer and disposal costs were also favorably impacted by
    increased internalization of our waste streams into landfills
    either owned or operated by us.

•

Fuel costs decreased approximately 35% from an average of $3.80
    per gallon during 2008 to an average of $2.47 per gallon during
    2009.

•

Landfill operating costs decreased 3.8% as a percentage of
    revenue, primarily due to charges we recorded during 2008
    consisting of $98.0 million related to estimated costs to
    comply with F&Os issued by the OEPA and the AOC issued by
    the EPA in response to environmental conditions at our
    Countywide facility, $21.9 million related to environmental
    conditions at our closed disposal facility in California and
    $34.0 million related to environmental conditions at the
    Sunrise Landfill. These charges increased our 2008 cost of
    operations as a percentage of revenue by 4.2% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

•

Other cost of operations increased 0.7% as a percentage of
    revenue primarily due to increases in occupancy and facility
    expenses as well as equipment rental expense.

Cost of
    Operations – 2008 versus 2007

Our cost of operations, as a percentage of revenue, increased
    2.5% to 65.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared
    to 63.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily as
    a result of the following:

•

Labor and related benefits as a percentage of revenue for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 versus 2007 decreased due to
    higher revenue resulting from improved pricing and lower labor
    costs associated with volume decreases in various lines of
    business.

•

Fuel costs increased 0.7% as a percentage of revenue during the
    year ended December 31, 2008 versus the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Our average cost of fuel per gallon
    increased approximately 38% from $2.76 per gallon during 2007 to
    $3.80 per gallon during 2008.



•

Landfill operating costs increased as a percentage of revenue
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus 2007, primarily
    due to charges we recorded during 2008 consisting of
    $98.0 million related to our Countywide facility,
    $21.9 million related to our closed disposal facility in
    California and $34.0 million charge related to the Sunrise
    Landfill. This increase was partially offset by a
    $41.0 million charge related to our Countywide facility and
    an $8.1 million charge related to our closed disposal
    facility in California recorded during 2007.

Depreciation,
    Amortization and Depletion of Property and
    Equipment

The following table summarizes depreciation, amortization and
    depletion of property and equipment for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in millions of dollars

    $299.0 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 9.7%, 9.3%
    and 9.4%, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The increase in such expenses in aggregate
    dollars for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008
    versus 2007 is primarily due to our acquisition of Allied in
    December 2008.

Depreciation,
    Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment –
    2009 versus 2008

The increase in depreciation, amortization and depletion
    expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to
    increases in depreciation and depletion expense associated with
    equipment and landfills acquired from Allied and recorded at
    their current fair values. We allocated $2.6 billion of
    fair value to the landfills we acquired from Allied. The
    increase in the landfill depletion and amortization in aggregate
    dollars is directly attributable to this allocation of fair
    value.

Depreciation,
    Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment –
    2008 versus 2007

The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 versus 2007 is primarily due
    to a reduction of amortization expense associated with lower
    landfill volumes. In addition, during the year ended
    December 31, 2007, we incurred approximately
    $3.3 million of additional depletion and amortization
    expense associated with a reduction of estimated remaining
    available airspace at our Countywide facility.

Amortization
    of Intangible and Other Assets

Expenses for amortization of intangible and other assets were
    $70.6 million, $11.8 million and $6.5 million,
    or, as a percentage of revenue, 0.9%, 0.3% and 0.2% for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Our other intangible and other assets primarily relate to
    customer lists, franchise agreements, municipal contracts, trade
    names, favorable lease assets and to a lesser extent non-compete
    agreements. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars
    and as a percentage of revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 versus 2007 is due to the
    amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of our
    acquisition of Allied.

Accretion
    Expense

Accretion expense was $88.8 million, $23.9 million and
    $17.1 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 1.1%, 0.7%
    and 0.5% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The increase in such



expenses in aggregate dollars in 2009 and 2008 versus 2007 is
    primarily due to an increase in asset retirement obligations
    associated with our acquisition of Allied. The asset retirement
    obligations acquired from Allied are recorded using a discount
    rate of 9.75%, which is higher than the credit-adjusted,
    risk-free rate we have used historically to record such
    obligations.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses were
    $880.4 million, $434.7 million and
    $313.7 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 10.7%,
    11.8% and 9.9%, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries,
    health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for
    corporate and field general management, field support functions,
    sales force, accounting and finance, legal, management
    information systems and clerical and administrative departments.
    Other expenses include rent and office costs, fees for
    professional services provided by third parties, marketing,
    investor and community relations, directors’ and
    officers’ insurance, general employee relocation, travel,
    entertainment and bank charges, but excludes any such amounts
    recorded as restructuring charges.

The following table provides the components of our selling,
    general and administrative costs for the three years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in millions of dollars
    and as a percentage of revenue):

The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and
    may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by
    other companies. As such, care should be taken when comparing
    our selling, general and administrative expenses by cost
    component to that of other companies.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses – 2009 versus

Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009 include
    $41.6 million of costs to achieve synergies related to the
    Allied merger. These costs primarily consist of a synergy
    related bonus of approximately $34 million accrued in 2009.
    We expect to incur an additional $34.0 million of expense
    during 2010 to fully accrue for the synergy related bonus.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded
    $14.2 million of bad debt expense related to conforming
    Allied’s methodology for recording the allowance for
    doubtful accounts on accounts receivable with ours and
    $5.4 million to provide for specific bankruptcy exposures.
    We also recorded $24.3 million of settlement charges
    related to our estimates of the outcome of various legal matters
    and a charge of $2.9 million related to the synergy related
    bonus.

Excluding charges for synergies, conforming accounting policies,
    bankruptcies and certain legal matters, selling, general and
    administrative expenses for the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008 would have been $838.8 million and
    $387.9 million, or 10.2% and 10.5% as a percentage of
    revenue, respectively. Upon the completion of the integration of
    Allied, our goal is to maintain our selling, general and
    administrative costs at no more than 10.0% of revenue, which we
    believe is appropriate given our existing business platform.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses – 2008 versus

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses
    (excluding the costs mentioned above) in aggregate dollars
    during 2008 versus 2007 is primarily due to our merger with
    Allied. The increase in such



expenses as a percentage of revenue for 2008 versus 2007 is
    primarily due to our merger with Allied and a $4.3 million
    reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts which we
    recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007 as a
    result of refining our estimate for our allowance based on our
    historical collection experience.

(Gain)
    Loss on Disposition of Assets and Impairments, Net

(Gain) loss on disposition of assets and impairments, net of
    costs to sell was $(137.0) million and $89.8 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, and nil for the year ended December 31, 2007.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we divested of
    certain assets as required by the DOJ as a condition of the
    merger with Allied and recorded a gain of $153.5 million.
    Offsetting this gain was a loss of $10.2 million recognized
    in connection with the divestiture of a hauling operation in
    Miami-Dade County, Florida as well as $7.1 million of
    additional asset impairments, primarily related to our former
    corporate offices and other assets sold or held for sale.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a
    charge of $75.9 million related to the impairment of our
    Countywide facility. This impairment relates to the anticipated
    loss of permitted airspace associated with complying with
    F&Os issued by the OEPA and the AOC issued by the EPA based
    upon recent negotiations with the OEPA and the EPA. Also during
    the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded
    $7.8 million of other impairment charges, consisting
    primarily of charges related to our former corporate office in
    South Florida.

Restructuring
    Charges

As a result of our acquisition of Allied, we committed to a
    restructuring plan related to our corporate overhead and other
    administrative and operating functions. The plan included
    closing our corporate office in Florida, consolidating
    administrative functions to Arizona, the former headquarters of
    Allied, and reducing staffing levels. The plan also included
    closing and consolidating certain operating locations and
    terminating certain leases. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we incurred $63.2 million of
    restructuring and integration charges related to our integration
    of Allied, of which $34.0 million consists of charges for
    severance and other employee termination and relocation
    benefits. The remainder of the charges primarily related to
    consulting and professional fees. Substantially, all the charges
    are recorded in our corporate segment. During 2010, we expect to
    incur additional charges approximating $12 million to
    complete our plan. We expect that the majority of these charges
    will be paid during 2010 and will extend into 2011.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense was $595.9 million, $131.9 million
    and $94.8 million for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The following table provides
    the components of interest expense, including accretion of debt
    discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with
    environmental and self-funded risk insurance liabilities assumed
    in the acquisition of Allied:

The increase in interest expense during the year ended

    additional debt we assumed as a result of our acquisition of
    Allied. Interest expense also increased as a result of accreting
    discounts applied to debt or imputing interest on environmental
    and risk reserves assumed from Allied.



Loss
    on Extinguishment of Debt

Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $134.1 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting from the
    following:

•

In September 2009, we issued $650.0 million of
    5.500% Senior Notes due 2019 with an unamortized discount
    of $4.5 million at December 31, 2009. A portion of the
    net proceeds from these notes was used to purchase and retire
    $325.5 million of our outstanding senior notes maturing in
    2010 and 2011.

•

In November 2009, we issued $600.0 million of
    5.250% Senior Notes due 2021. The net proceeds from these
    notes as well as draws on our revolver were used to purchase and
    retire our 7.875% Senior Notes due 2013 (redeemed at
    102.625%), our 7.375% Senior Notes due 2014 (redeemed at
    103.688%), and our 4.250% Senior Subordinated Convertible
    Debentures due 2034 (redeemed at par).

•

In addition, during 2009 we repurchased and retired certain of
    our senior notes in the secondary market.

The loss on extinguishment of debt recorded during 2009 consists
    of premiums paid to repurchase debt, the charge for unamortized
    debt discounts and professional fees paid to effectuate the
    repurchase. In the future we may chose to voluntarily retire
    certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity
    using cash from operations or additional borrowings. We may also
    explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions.
    The early extinguishment of debt may result in an impairment
    charge in the period in which the debt is repurchased and
    retired.

Interest
    Income and Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest income and other income, net of other expense, was
    $5.2 million, $8.0 million and $26.9 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Income
    Taxes

Our provision for income taxes was $368.5 million,
    $85.4 million and $177.9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our
    effective income tax rate was 42.6%, 53.6% and 38.0% for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Our effective income tax rate is adversely impacted by expenses
    incurred which are non-deductible for tax, disposition of assets
    that have little or no basis for tax, and accruals for penalties
    and interest on uncertain tax positions.

In the future we may choose to divest certain operating assets
    that have little or no tax basis, thereby resulting in a higher
    taxable gain than otherwise would be recognized. The higher
    taxable gain will increase our effective rate in the quarter in
    which the divestiture is consummated.

With respect to the settlement of certain tax liabilities
    regarding our risk management companies, we paid approximately
    $58 million in the first quarter of 2010 and anticipate
    paying the remainder, approximately $67 million, later in
    2010.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred
    expenses that were not tax deductible as a result of the merger
    with Allied. In addition, lower pre-tax earnings contributed to
    the increase in our effective tax rate.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a net
    tax benefit of $4.8 million in our provision for income
    taxes related to the resolution of various income tax matters,
    including the effective completion of Internal Revenue Service
    audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001
    through 2004.

Corporate entities include legal, tax, treasury, information
    technology, risk management, human resources, corporate accounts
    and other typical administrative functions. National accounts
    revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of
    revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside
    our operating areas, and, as such, the associated waste handling
    services are subcontracted to local operators. Consequently,
    substantially all of this revenue is offset with related
    subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations.

We completed the reorganization of our operating segments
    related to our acquisition of Allied in the first quarter of
    2009, and are providing internal and external reporting in
    accordance with our reorganized structure. Significant changes
    in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments
    comparing 2009 with 2008 and comparing 2008 with 2007 are
    discussed in the following paragraphs. The increase in aggregate
    dollars for revenue, depreciation, amortization, depletion and
    accretion, and operating income (loss) for each of our
    reportable segments is due to our acquisition of Allied. The
    results of our reportable segments were also affected by the
    disposition of certain assets and liabilities, as required by
    the DOJ. Where the effect was significant, we have noted our
    operating margin exclusive of these gains and losses.
    Additionally, the decrease in revenue resulting from declines in
    volumes and commodity prices noted below are attributable to the
    economic slowdown.

    compared to 2008

•

Eastern Region.

Revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 benefited from core price growth in all
    lines of business. However, the increase in revenue from core
    price was more than offset by volume



declines in all lines of business, especially in our industrial
    and landfill lines of business. We also experienced declines in
    fuel surcharges.

In 2009, we realized a $4.0 million net gain from the
    disposition of assets, which increased operating margins by
    0.2%. We also recovered $12.0 million of insurance proceeds
    related to remediation costs at our Countywide facility in Ohio,
    which increased operating margins by 0.6%.

In 2008, we incurred a $99.9 million charge for
    environmental conditions at our Countywide facility, which
    reduced our operating margin for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 by 10.1%. We incurred a
    $75.9 million charge related to the anticipated loss of
    permitted airspace at Countywide based upon negotiations with
    the OEPA and EPA, which reduced our operating margin by 7.7%. We
    also incurred $11.0 million in legal settlement costs,
    which decreased operating margins by 1.1%.

The remaining increase in operating margins is attributed to
    lower fuel, disposal, and selling, general and administrative
    expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and
    amortization costs resulting from assets acquired from Allied
    and higher labor and facilities expense.

In 2009, we realized net gains from the disposition of assets of
    $27.1 million, which increased operating margins by 1.5%.
    Otherwise, the improvement in operating margin for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to lower
    transportation, fuel, and selling, general and administrative
    expenses. The increase in operating margin was partially offset
    by increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting
    from assets acquired from Allied and higher facilities expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we realized net gains
    from the disposition of assets of $29.8 million, which
    impacted operating margins by 1.5%. We also realized in 2009 an
    $8.8 million favorable adjustment to amortization expense
    for asset retirement obligations which increased our operating
    margin by 0.4%. Otherwise the improvement in operating margin
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, is primarily due to
    lower disposal, transport and fuel costs, partially offset by
    increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from
    assets acquired from Allied and higher facilities expense.

Western Region.

Revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 benefited from core price growth in all
    lines of business. However, the increase in revenue from core
    price was more than offset by volume declines in all lines of
    business, especially in our industrial and landfill lines of
    business. We also experienced declines in fuel surcharges.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we realized gains
    from the disposition of assets of $88.1 million, which
    increased operating margins by 4.1%. Partially offsetting these
    gains was an unfavorable adjustment to amortization expense for
    asset retirement obligations of $6.4 million, reducing
    operating margin by 0.3%, and remediation charges totaling
    $5.2 million, reducing operating margin by 0.3% related to
    environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in
    California. In addition, lower landfill revenue (which has
    higher margins than our collection line of business) negatively
    impacted 2009 margins.

In the second quarter of 2008, we incurred a $34.0 million
    charge at the Sunrise Landfill and a $21.9 million charge
    at our closed disposal facility in California for environmental
    conditions at each of these locations. The charges reduced
    operating margin by 5.9%. Margins were favorably impacted by
    lower labor, fuel, transportation and selling, general and
    administrative expenses, offset by increased depreciation and
    amortization expense resulting from assets acquired from Allied
    and higher facilities expense.



•

Corporate Entities.

The increase in net
    revenue relates to Allied’s national accounts program. The
    increase in depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion
    expense, and the increase in the operating loss are attributable
    to the acquisition of Allied. Included in our gain (loss) on
    disposition of assets and impairments, net for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 are transaction related expenses of
    $8.2 million from the disposition of assets in the other
    segments and a $3.7 million charge for the asset impairment
    associated with our former corporate office in Florida.

    compared to 2007

•

Eastern Region.

Revenue in our Eastern Region
    increased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to the addition of
    operating results for Allied from the date of the acquisition
    which was effective December 5, 2008. The increase in
    revenue is also due to price increases in all lines of business.
    This increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in
    volumes in all lines of business and a decrease in the prices of
    commodities. The decrease in volume is primarily attributable to
    less temporary work and lower transfer station volumes due to
    less construction activity.

The operating loss in 2008 includes remediation charges of
    $99.9 million related to estimated costs to comply with the
    F&Os issued by the OEPA and the AOC issued by the EPA
    related to our Countywide facility and an impairment charge of
    $75.9 million related to the anticipated loss of permitted
    airspace at Countywide based upon negotiations with the OEPA and
    EPA. It also includes $11.0 million of settlement costs for
    certain legal matters.

Operating income for 2007 includes a $44.6 million charge
    to operating expenses associated with environmental conditions
    at Countywide.

•

Midwest Region.

Revenue increased during 2008
    compared to 2007 due to the acquisition of Allied and price
    increases in all lines of business. This increase in revenue was
    partially offset by lower volumes in all lines of business and
    lower prices of commodities due to the economic slowdown.

Operating margins decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to
    an adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement
    obligations during 2007 and due to higher fuel costs.

•

Southern Region.

The acquisition of Allied
    and price increases in all lines of business resulted in an
    increase in revenue during 2008 compared to 2007. This increase
    in revenue was partially offset by volume declines in our
    industrial collection line of business and at our landfills.
    This increase in revenue was also partially offset by the sale
    of our Texas-based compost, mulch and soil business in November
    2007.

Operating margins increased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to
    higher revenue, lower disposal costs and lower insurance costs,
    partially offset by higher fuel costs.

•

Western Region.

The acquisition of Allied and
    price increases in all lines of business resulted in an increase
    in revenue during 2008 compared to 2007. This increase in
    revenue was partially offset by a decrease in industrial
    collection, commercial collection, transfer station and landfill
    volumes resulting from the economic slowdown. This increase in
    revenue was also partially offset by lower prices of commodities.

Operating income in 2008 includes a $34.0 million charge
    related to estimated costs to comply with a Consent Decree and
    Settlement Agreement signed with the EPA, the Bureau of Land
    Management and Clark County, Nevada related to the Sunrise
    Landfill. It also includes a $21.9 million charge recorded
    during 2008 associated with environmental conditions at our
    closed disposal facility in California.

Operating income in 2007 includes an $8.1 million increase
    in landfill operating costs and a $5.2 million increase in
    amortization expense for asset retirement obligations associated
    with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in
    California.

•

Corporate Entities.

The increase in operating
    costs includes professional fees, distributions under cash and
    equity award programs, and relocation, severance and other
    employee termination benefits related to our merger with Allied.
    Included in our gain (loss) on disposition of assets and
    impairments, net for the year



ended December 31, 2008 is a $6.0 million charge for
    the asset impairment associated with our former corporate office
    in Florida.

Landfill
    and Environmental Matters

Our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of
    capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure
    and post-closure, and the legal and administrative costs of
    ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses
    include leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and
    groundwater monitoring and system maintenance, interim cap
    maintenance, and costs associated with the application of daily
    cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development
    costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to
    landfill development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct
    costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on
    the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These
    costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site,
    including excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction
    of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas
    collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater
    monitoring wells, and other costs associated with the
    acquisition and development of the site. Obligations associated
    with final capping, closure and post-closure are capitalized and
    amortized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed.

Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and
    accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense
    capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate
    to changes in costs, available airspace, inflation and
    applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include
    changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes
    due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we
    believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted.

Changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications
    to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a
    refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated
    information. Changes in design typically include significant
    modifications to a landfill’s footprint or vertical slopes.

As of December 31, 2009, we owned or operated 192 active
    solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity
    estimated to be 4.6 billion in-place cubic yards. Total
    available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated
    permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion
    airspace. These estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial
    surveys. As of December 31, 2009, total available disposal
    capacity is estimated to be 4.4 billion in-place cubic
    yards of permitted airspace plus 0.2 billion in-place cubic
    yards of probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included
    in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion
    airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total
    available disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion
    criteria. See Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies,

and Note 8,

Landfill and Environmental
    Costs

, to our consolidated financial statements in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further information. During 2009, total available airspace
    decreased by a net 296.9 million cubic yards primarily due
    to divestitures, closures and airspace consumed, partially
    offset by new expansions.

During 2008, total available airspace increased by a net
    3.2 billion cubic yards due to the merger with Allied in
    December, which contributed 157 active landfills representing
    3.3 billion cubic yards of permitted and probable expansion
    airspace. Excluding the merger with Allied, total available
    airspace related to Republic’s pre-merger operations
    decreased by a net 0.1 billion cubic yards, primarily due
    to airspace consumed, changes in engineering estimates and
    changes in design. The decrease during 2008 due to changes in
    engineering estimates is primarily due to a reduction of
    remaining airspace at our Countywide facility.



During 2007, total available airspace increased by a net
    7.5 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken,
    changes in engineering estimates and permits granted, partially
    offset by airspace consumed and changes in design. In addition,
    total available airspace increased as a result of obtaining a
    new contract to operate a landfill in Texas, which was
    substantially offset by a reduction resulting from not renewing
    a contract to operate a small landfill in Texas. Changes in
    design in 2007 are primarily due to a reduction of estimated
    remaining available airspace at our Countywide facility.

At December 31, 2006, 7.2% of our total available airspace,
    or 124.6 million cubic yards, consisted of probable
    expansion airspace at eight of our landfills. At
    December 31, 2009, 4.6% of our total available airspace, or
    212.5 million cubic yards, consisted of probable expansion
    airspace at twelve of our landfills. Between December 31,
    2006 and December 31, 2009, we received permits for twelve
    of our probable expansions, which demonstrates our continued
    success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace.

As of December 31, 2009, twelve of our landfills meet all
    of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace
    in their total available disposal capacity, eight of which were
    added as a result of our acquisition of Allied. At projected
    annual volumes, these landfills have an estimated remaining
    average site life of 39 years, including probable expansion
    airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our
    landfills is 46 years. We have other expansion
    opportunities that are not included in our total available
    airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for
    probable expansion airspace.

The following table reflects the estimated operating lives of
    our active landfill sites based on available and probable
    disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of
    December 31, 2009:

Final
    Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

As of December 31, 2009, accrued final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs were $1,074.5 million, of which
    $137.5 million is current and $937.0 million is
    long-term as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in
    accrued landfill and environmental costs.

Remediation
    and Other Charges for Landfill Matters

In December 2009, we finalized our purchase price allocation for
    the environmental liabilities we assumed as part of the
    acquisition of Allied. These liabilities represent our estimate
    of costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or
    operated by Allied or sites at which Allied, or a predecessor
    company that it had acquired, had been identified as a
    potentially responsible party. The remediation of these sites is
    in various stages of completion from having received an initial
    notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to
    being in the final stages of post remedial monitoring. See also
    Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies — Environmental Remediation Liabilities,

for further information. We have recorded these liabilities
    at their estimated fair values using a discount rate of 9.75%.
    Discounted liabilities are accreted to interest expense through
    the period that they are paid.



The following is a discussion of certain of our significant
    remediation matters:

Countywide Landfill.

In 2007, we were issued Final
    Findings and Orders (F&Os) by the Ohio Environmental
    Protection Agency (OEPA) related to environmental conditions at
    our Countywide Recycling and Disposal Facility (Countywide) in
    East Sparta, Ohio and we agreed to undertake certain other
    remedial actions with the OEPA as well. During 2008, Republic
    Services of Ohio II, LLC (Republic-Ohio), an Ohio limited
    liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of ours and parent
    of Countywide, entered into an Agreed Order on Consent (AOC)
    with the EPA requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred by
    the EPA and requiring Republic-Ohio to perform certain
    remediation activities at Countywide. Republic-Ohio also has
    completed construction of an isolation break under the authority
    and supervision of the U.S. EPA. On September 30,
    2009, Republic-Ohio entered into a set of F&Os with the
    OEPA that supersede previous F&Os mentioned above. The
    F&Os require the implementation of a comprehensive
    operation and maintenance program for managing the remediation
    area. The operation and maintenance program requires
    Republic-Ohio to maintain the temporary cap and other
    engineering controls to prevent odors and isolate and contain
    the reaction. The operation and maintenance program also
    requires the installation of a composite cap in the remediation
    area when conditions become conducive to such installation, and
    is ultimately designed to result in the final capping and
    closure of the

88-acre

remediation area at Countywide. The remediation liability for
    Countywide recorded as of December 31, 2009 is
    $74.2 million, of which approximately $5.7 million is
    expected to be paid during 2010.

West Contra Costa County Landfill.

In 2006, we were
    issued an Enforcement Order by the California Department of
    Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) for the Class 1 Hazardous
    waste cell at the West Contra Costa County Landfill (West
    County). Subsequently, we entered into a Consent Agreement with
    DTSC in 2007 at which time we agreed to undertake certain
    remedial actions. The remediation liability for West County
    recorded as of December 31, 2009 is $46.8 million, of
    which approximately $1.6 million is expected to be paid
    during 2010.

Sunrise Landfill.

On August 1, 2008, Republic
    Services of Southern Nevada (RSSN), our wholly owned subsidiary,
    signed a Consent Decree with the EPA, the Bureau of Land
    Management and Clark County, Nevada related to the Sunrise
    Landfill. Under the Consent Decree, RSSN has agreed to perform
    certain remedial actions at the Sunrise Landfill for which RSSN
    and Clark County were otherwise jointly and severally liable.
    RSSN is currently working with the Clark County Staff and Board
    of Commissioners to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to
    comply with the Consent Decree. However, we have not recorded
    any potential recoveries. The remediation liability for Sunrise
    recorded as of December 31, 2009 is $37.0 million, of
    which approximately $12.8 million is expected to be paid
    during 2010.

Congress Development Landfill.

In January 2006,
    Congress Development Co. (CDC) was issued an Agreed
    Preliminary Injunction and Order by the Circuit Court of
    Illinois, Cook County. Subsequently, the court issued two
    additional Supplemental Orders that required CDC to implement
    certain remedial actions at the Congress Landfill. The
    remediation liability recorded for CDC as of December 31,
    2009 is $82.5 million, of which approximately
    $19.9 million is expected to be paid during 2010.

It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the
    charges noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional
    information, to the extent that such information impacts the
    costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future
    changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the
    required actions could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

The increase in the investment in our landfills, both in
    aggregate dollars and as an investment per cubic yard, is
    primarily due to the acquisition of Allied in December 2008.
    Landfill development cost in the above table includes
    $2.6 billion of purchase price for the acquisition that has
    been allocated to the permitted and probable expansion airspace
    acquired based on its fair value as of the date of the
    acquisition. Depletion, amortization and accretion expense
    increased from 2008 to 2009 and from 2007 to 2008 primarily due
    to accretion expense associated with capping, closure and
    post-closure liabilities assumed from Allied. The asset
    retirement obligations assumed from Allied are recorded using a
    discount rate of 9.75%, which is higher than the rate we have
    historically used. See Note 2,

Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies,

regarding asset retirement obligation
    adjustments.

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    our weighted-average compaction rate was approximately 1,700
    pounds per cubic yard based on our three-year historical moving
    average. Our compaction rates may improve as a result of the
    settlement and decomposition of waste.

As of December 31, 2009, we expect to spend an estimated
    additional $6.0 billion on existing landfills, primarily
    related to cell construction and environmental structures, over
    their expected remaining lives. Our total expected investment,
    excluding non-depletable land, estimated to be
    $9.2 billion, or $1.98 per cubic yard, is used in
    determining our depletion and amortization expense based on
    airspace consumed using the

units-of-consumption

method.

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our
    operating cash flows for 2009 and 2008 are summarized below:

Earnings increase.

Our net income increased by
    $422.6 million, on a

year-over-year

basis, primarily due to the acquisition of Allied in December
    2008, which positively affected our cash flow from operations in
    2009.

Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from
    business acquisitions and divestitures.

Changes in
    assets and liabilities negatively affected our cash flow from
    operations by $251.9 million in 2009 versus a negative
    impact of $78.9 million in 2008, primarily as a result of
    the following:

•

During 2009, the cash we paid to settle our capping, closure,
    post-closure and remediation obligations increased by
    $85.9 million. The increase in cash paid for closure and
    post closure activities is primarily due to our acquisition of
    Allied.

•

During 2009, we paid $66.5 million for restructuring and
    synergy related costs incurred in connection with the
    restructuring plan formulated as a result of our acquisition of
    Allied. The plan included closing our corporate office in
    Florida, consolidating administrative functions to Arizona, the
    former headquarters of Allied, and reducing staffing levels.

•

During 2009, we made income tax payments (net of refunds
    received) of approximately $444 million, of which
    approximately $105 million relates to taxes on our
    divestitures. During 2008, we made income tax payments (net of
    refunds received) of approximately $128 million. During
    2008, approximately $32 million of federal tax payments
    were deferred and paid in 2009 as a result of the merger with
    Allied. With respect to the settlement of certain tax
    liabilities regarding our risk management companies, we paid
    approximately $58 million in the first quarter of 2010 and
    expect to pay the remainder, approximately $67 million,
    later in 2010.

Cash provided by operating activities was $512.2 million
    and $661.3 million for the years ended December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The changes in cash provided by
    operating activities during the periods are primarily due to the
    expansion of our business, the timing of payments received for
    accounts receivable, and the timing of payments made for
    accounts payable and federal income taxes.



We use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures,
    acquisitions, dividend payments and debt repayments.

Cash
    Flows Used in Investing Activities

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our
    investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized
    below:

Capital expenditures.

Capital expenditures during
    2009 were $826.3 million, compared with $386.9 million
    in 2008 and $292.5 million in 2007. Capital expenditures in
    2009 were higher than either 2008 or 2007 due to our acquisition
    of Allied in December 2008. During 2010, we expect our capital
    expenditures to approximate $870 million. However, we
    expect property and equipment received during 2010 to be
    $790 million, which excludes $80 million of property
    and equipment received during 2009 but paid for during 2010.

Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash
    acquired.

Cash paid for acquisitions decreased from
    $553.8 million during 2008 to $0.1 million during
    2009. Cash paid for acquisitions in 2008 relates to the
    retirement of Allied’s credit facility at the close of the
    acquisition, net of cash acquired, and $13.4 million of
    cash paid for other acquisitions.

Proceeds from divestitures.

Proceeds from
    divestitures (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets
    were $511.1 million in 2009, $3.3 million in 2008 and
    $42.1 million in 2007. Proceeds from divestitures in 2009
    were the result of divestitures of certain assets as required by
    the DOJ as a condition of the merger with Allied and certain
    other business dispositions. Proceeds from divestitures in 2007
    related primarily to the disposition of our compost, mulch and
    soil business in Texas.

Change in restricted cash and marketable
    securities.

Changes in our restricted cash and
    marketable securities balances, which are largely related to the
    issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs and amounts
    held in trust as a guarantee of performance, contributed
    $41.6 million to our investing activities in 2009 compared
    to uses of cash of $5.3 million and $11.6 million in
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The funds received from issuances
    of tax-exempt bonds are deposited directly into trust accounts
    by the bonding authority at the time of issuance. As we do not
    have the ability to use these funds for general operating
    purposes, they are classified as restricted cash in our
    consolidated balance sheets. Proceeds from bond issuances
    represent cash used in investing activities in our consolidated
    statements of cash flows. Reimbursements from the trust for
    qualifying expenditures are presented as cash provided by
    investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash
    flows. During 2009, our reimbursements from restricted cash
    accounts exceeded funds received from the issuance of tax-exempt
    bonds.

We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions
    through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital
    expenditures, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit
    facilities, and tax-exempt bonds and other financings. We expect
    to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions.

Cash
    Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash
    flows from financing activities for the periods presented are
    summarized below:

Net debt repayments or borrowings.

Payments of notes
    payable and long-term debt net of proceeds from notes payable
    and long-term debt and issuance of senior notes were
    $865.9 million in 2009 versus net borrowing of
    $712.8 million and $11.1 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. During 2009, we issued $650.0 million of
    5.500% Senior Notes due 2019 and $600.0 million of
    5.250% Senior Notes due 2021. The primary use of proceeds
    from the notes together with draws on our Credit Facilities was
    to purchase and retire: (i) $325.5 million of varied
    senior notes maturing in 2010 and 2011 pursuant to our September
    2009 tender offer; (ii) $450.0 million of 7.875% of
    Senior Notes due 2013; (iii) $400.0 million of
    7.375% Senior Notes due 2014; (iv) $230.0 million
    of 4.250% Senior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due
    2034 and; (v) repurchase certain of our senior notes
    maturing in 2010 and 2011 in the secondary market. Additionally,
    our senior unsecured notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of
    7.125% matured during 2009. We repaid the remaining principal
    balance of $99.3 million in May 2009. Net borrowings reflected
    in our cash flows provided by financing activities in 2008 were
    primarily related to the merger with Allied. We used proceeds
    from our revolver to refinance extensions of credit under
    Allied’s senior credit facility, to pay



fees and expenses in connection therewith, and to pay fees and
    expenses incurred in connection with the merger.

Premiums and fees paid to issue and retire senior
    notes.

In connection with the issuance of our senior
    notes as well as purchasing and retiring certain indebtedness in
    2009, we incurred cash premiums and fees totaling
    $61.6 million.

Purchase of common stock for treasury.

From 2000
    through 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
    of up to $2.6 billion of our common stock. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had paid $2.3 billion to
    repurchase 82.6 million shares of our common stock, of
    which $138.4 million was paid during 2008 to repurchase
    4.6 million shares and $362.8 million was paid during
    2007 to repurchase 11.1 million shares of our common stock.
    The stock repurchase program was suspended in the second quarter
    of 2008 due to the pending merger with Allied. We expect that
    the share repurchase program will continue to be suspended until
    at least 2011.

Cash dividends paid.

We initiated a quarterly cash
    dividend in July 2003. The dividend has been increased each year
    thereafter, with the latest increase occurring in the third
    quarter of 2008. Our current quarterly dividend per share is
    $0.19. Dividends paid were $288.3 million,
    $128.3 million and $93.9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Financial
    Condition

As of December 31, 2009, we had $48.0 million of cash
    and cash equivalents, and $240.5 million of restricted cash
    deposits and restricted marketable securities, including
    $93.1 million of restricted cash held for capital
    expenditures under certain debt facilities.

In April 2007, we increased our unsecured revolving credit
    facility from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion and
    extended the term from 2010 to 2012. In conjunction with the
    merger with Allied, in September 2008, we entered into an
    additional $1.75 billion revolving credit facility with a
    group of banks. This credit facility was used initially at the
    time of the merger to refinance extensions of credit under
    Allied’s senior credit facility, to pay fees and expenses
    in connection therewith, and to pay fees and expenses incurred
    in connection with the merger. We also amended our existing
    $1.0 billion credit facility to conform certain terms of
    the facility to those included in our new $1.75 billion
    credit facility. We did not change the maturity date of the
    $1.0 billion credit facility.

The $1.0 billion revolving credit facility due April 2012
    and the $1.75 billion revolving credit facility due
    September 2013 (collectively, Credit Facilities) bear interest
    at a Base Rate, or a Eurodollar Rate, plus an applicable margin
    based on our Debt Ratings (all as defined in the agreements). As
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the interest rate for our
    borrowings under our Credit Facilities was 1.82% and 3.43%,
    respectively. Our Credit Facilities are also subject to facility
    fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the
    aggregate commitments, regardless of usage. Borrowings under our
    Credit Facilities can be used for working capital, capital
    expenditures, letters of credit and other general corporate
    purposes. We had $0.3 billion and $0.6 billion of
    Eurodollar Rate borrowings, and $1.6 billion and
    $1.7 billion of letters of credit utilizing availability
    under our Credit Facilities, leaving $0.8 billion and
    $0.4 billion of availability under our Credit Facilities at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The agreements governing the Credit Facilities require us to
    comply with certain financial and other covenants. We have the
    ability to pay dividends and to repurchase common stock provided
    that we are in compliance with these covenants. Compliance with
    these covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings
    under the Credit Facilities and failure to meet these covenants
    would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding
    loans (which would adversely affect our liquidity). At
    December 31, 2009, our EBITDA to interest ratio was 4.01
    compared to the 3.00 minimum required by the covenants. In
    addition, at December 31, 2009, our total debt to EBITDA
    ratio was 2.87 compared to the 4.00 maximum allowed by the
    covenants. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with
    the covenants of the Credit Facilities, and during 2010 we
    expect to be in compliance.



EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as defined
    in our Credit Facility agreements. In this context, EBITDA is
    used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which
    we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable
    to EBITDA used by other companies or used by us for other
    purposes.

In December 2009 we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings
    under our Credit Facilities to redeem $400.0 million of our
    7.375% Senior Notes due 2014. The Senior Notes were
    redeemed at a price equal to 103.688% of the principal amount of
    the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We incurred a
    charge of $46.0 million for premiums paid to repurchase
    debt, the charge for unamortized debt discounts and professional
    fees paid to effectuate the repurchase.

In November 2009, we issued $600.0 million of Senior Notes
    with a fixed interest rate of 5.250% due 2021 in a private
    placement transaction. The notes are general senior unsecured
    obligations and mature on November 15, 2021. Interest is
    payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15, beginning
    May 15, 2010. These Senior Notes are guaranteed by each of
    our subsidiaries that also guarantee our Credit Facilities.
    These guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of the
    subsidiary guarantors. In addition, we entered into a
    Registration Rights Agreement with the initial purchasers of the
    notes. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to use
    our reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a
    registration statement to exchange the notes for freely tradable
    notes issued by us. If we are unable to effect the exchange
    offer within 365 days, we agreed to pay additional interest
    on the notes. We used the net proceeds from the notes, cash on
    hand or incremental borrowings under our Credit Facilities as
    follows: (i) to redeem $450.0 million of our
    7.875% Senior Notes due 2013 at 102.625%, and (ii) to
    redeem $230.0 million of our 4.250% Senior
    Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2034 at par. We incurred
    a loss of $51.9 million for premiums paid to repurchase
    debt, charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional
    fees paid to effectuate the repurchase.

In September 2009, we issued $650.0 million of
    5.500% Senior Notes due 2019 with an unamortized discount
    of $4.5 million at December 31, 2009. The notes are
    general senior unsecured obligations and mature on
    September 15, 2019. Interest is payable semi-annually on
    March 15 and September 15, beginning March 15, 2010.
    The notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also
    guarantee our Credit Facilities. These guarantees are general
    senior unsecured obligations of subsidiary guarantors. In
    addition, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with
    the initial purchasers of the notes. Under the Registration
    Rights Agreement, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts
    to cause to become effective a registration statement to
    exchange the notes for freely tradable notes issued by us. If we
    are unable to effect the exchange offer within 365 days, we
    agreed to pay additional interest on the notes. We used the net
    proceeds from the notes, cash on hand or incremental borrowings
    under our Credit Facilities as follows:
    (i) $325.5 million to tender for certain outstanding
    senior notes maturing in 2010 and 2011 that were issued by us or
    one of our subsidiaries; (ii) approximately
    $250 million to reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit
    Facilities, and (iii) approximately $105 million to
    remit estimated tax payments related to our divestiture of
    assets in connection with our merger with Allied. We incurred a
    loss of $31.8 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt,
    charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees
    paid to effectuate the repurchase.

During 2009, we repurchased a portion of our senior notes
    maturing in 2010 and 2011 in the secondary market, and as a
    result, we incurred additional losses on extinguishment of debt
    of $4.4 million related to premiums paid to repurchase
    debt, charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional
    fees paid to effectuate the repurchase. Also during 2009, we
    completed the required divestitures under the consent decree
    with the DOJ. Proceeds from the sales of the divested assets
    were primarily used to reduce amounts outstanding under our
    Credit Facilities. Additionally, our senior unsecured notes
    bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.125% matured during 2009.
    We repaid the remaining principal balance of $99.3 million in
    May 2009.

In the first quarter of 2010 we called $425.0 million of
    our 6.125% senior notes due 2014. We expect to incur a loss
    upon extinguishment of the debt of approximately $52 million.

We have an accounts receivable securitization program with two
    financial institutions that allows us to borrow up to
    $300.0 million on a revolving basis under loan agreements
    secured by receivables. As of December 31, 2009,
    receivables secured loans totaled $300.0 million. In May
    2009, we renewed the facility for 364 days and reduced the
    borrowing capacity from $400.0 million to
    $300.0 million. We expect to repay the facility from



free cash flow, draws on our Credit Facilities or proceeds from
    other note offerings on or before the May 2010 maturity.

In order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest
    rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with
    investment grade-rated financial institutions. Our outstanding
    swap agreements have a total notional value of
    $210.0 million and require us to pay interest at floating
    rates based on changes in LIBOR and receive interest at a fixed
    rate of 6.75%. Our swap agreements mature in August 2011.

At December 31, 2009, we had $1,223.7 million of
    tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings. Borrowings
    under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on
    fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market
    ranging from 0.20% to 8.25% at December 31, 2009 and have
    maturities ranging from 2010 to 2037. As of December 31,
    2009, we had $93.1 million of restricted cash related to
    proceeds from tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings.
    This restricted cash will be used to reimburse capital
    expenditures under the terms of the agreements.

We intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating
    activities to repay debt, which may include purchases of our
    outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise.
    We believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities
    and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us
    with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated
    capital requirements and obligations as they come due.

In the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain
    portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity date
    using cash from operations or additional borrowings. We may also
    explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions
    should market conditions be favorable. The early extinguishment
    of debt may result in an impairment charge in the period in
    which the debt is repurchased and retired. The loss on early
    extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate
    the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note
    discounts and debt issue costs.

Credit
    Rating

We have received investment grade credit ratings. As of
    December 31, 2009, our senior debt was rated BBB, Baa3, and
    BBB- by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Inc.,
    Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch, Inc.,
    respectively.

Fuel
    Hedges

We use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to
    manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices. We have
    entered into multiple swap agreements related to forecasted
    diesel fuel purchases. The swaps qualified for, and were
    designated as, effective hedges of changes in the prices of
    forecasted diesel fuel purchases (fuel hedges).

We have the following fuel hedges outstanding at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008:

If the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon
    of diesel fuel (average price) as published by the Department of
    Energy exceeds the contract price per gallon, we receive the
    difference between the average



price and the contract price (multiplied by the notional
    gallons) from the counter-party. If the national
    U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel
    is less than the contract price per gallon, we pay the
    difference to the counter-party.

The fair values of our fuel hedges are obtained from third-party
    counter-parties and are determined using standard option
    valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being
    based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in
    the fair value hierarchy). The aggregated fair values of the
    outstanding fuel hedges at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were
    current assets of $3.2 million and $1.2 million,
    respectively, and accrued liabilities of $4.9 million and
    $12.9 million, respectively, and have been recorded in
    other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our
    consolidated balance sheets, respectively.

The effective portions of the changes in fair values as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, net of tax, of
    $1.0 million and $7.1 million, respectively, have been
    recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portions
    of the changes in fair values as of December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007 were immaterial and have been recorded in other income
    (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income.
    Realized (losses) gains of $(7.3) million,
    $5.9 million and $(1.6) million related to these fuel
    hedges are included in cost of operations in our consolidated
    statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Commodity
    Hedges

We use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to
    manage our exposure to changes in prices of certain commodities.
    We have entered into multiple agreements related to certain
    forecasted commodity sales. The swaps qualified for, and were
    designated as, effective hedges of changes in the prices of
    certain forecasted commodity sales (commodity hedges).

If the price per short ton of the hedging instrument (average
    price) as reported on the Official Board Market is less than the
    contract price per short ton, we receive the difference between
    the average price and the contract price (multiplied by the
    notional short tons) from the counter-party. If the price of the
    commodity exceeds the contract price per short ton, we pay the
    difference to the counter-party.

The fair values of our commodity hedges are obtained from
    third-party counter-parties and are determined using standard
    option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices
    being based on those observed in underlying markets
    (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). The aggregated fair
    values of the outstanding commodity hedges at December 31,
    2009 and 2008 were current assets of $1.8 million and
    $8.8 million, respectively, and current liabilities of
    $0.8 million and nil, respectively, and have been recorded
    in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our
    consolidated balance sheets, respectively.

The effective portions of the changes in fair values as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, net of tax, of
    $0.6 million and $5.3 million have been recorded in
    stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other



comprehensive income. The ineffective portions of the changes in
    fair values as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were
    immaterial and have been recorded in other income (expense), net
    in our consolidated statements of income.

The present value of capital lease obligations is included in
    our consolidated balance sheets.

The estimated remaining final capping, closure and post-closure
    expenditures presented above are not inflated and not discounted
    and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities
    incurred and recorded as of December 31, 2009.

Unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of
    (i) disposal related agreements which include fixed or
    minimum royalty payments, host agreements and

take-or-pay

and

put-or-pay

agreements and (ii) other obligations including committed
    capital expenditures and consulting service agreements.

In addition to the above, we have unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2009 of $242.2 million, of which we
    expect to settle approximately $10 million to
    $20 million within the next twelve months. Due to the
    uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows
    associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2009, we are unable to make reasonably
    reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements.

We also have letters of credit of $1.7 billion, of which
    $1.6 billion utilize availability under our Credit Facilities at
    December 31, 2009.

Debt
    covenants

Our Credit Facilities contain financial covenants. We have the
    ability to pay dividends and to repurchase common stock provided
    that we are in compliance with these covenants. At
    December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all financial
    and other covenants under our Credit Facilities. We were also in
    compliance with the non-financial covenants of the indentures
    relating to our senior notes as of December 31, 2009. We
    expect to be in compliance with our covenants during 2010.

On December 10, 2008, we received the requisite consents
    for a previously announced consent solicitation to amend the
    supplemental indentures governing certain outstanding debt
    securities of Allied Waste North America, Inc. (AWNA). The
    amendment to each supplemental indenture modified the ongoing
    reporting obligations required of Allied. Under the amended
    supplemental indentures, the ongoing reporting obligations may
    be satisfied by Republic.

The collateral that had secured the AWNA senior notes and the
    BFI debentures equally and ratably with the Allied bank credit
    facility was released upon the completion of the merger with
    Allied and the repayment of that facility.



Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under
    our Credit Facilities, as well as the occurrence of certain
    material adverse events, would constitute defaults and would
    allow the lenders under our Credit Facilities to accelerate the
    maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements. This
    could also have an adverse impact on the availability of
    financial assurances. In addition, maturity acceleration on our
    Credit Facilities constitutes an event of default under our
    other debt instruments, including our senior notes, and,
    therefore, our senior notes would also be subject to
    acceleration of maturity. If such acceleration were to occur, we
    would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the
    indebtedness. We would likely have to seek an amendment under
    our Credit Facilities for relief from the financial covenants or
    repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or
    equity, or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend
    our Credit Facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such
    obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated.

Financial
    assurance

We are required to provide financial assurance to governmental
    agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable
    environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations
    for capping, closure and post-closure costs, and related to our
    performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer
    station contracts. We satisfy these financial assurance
    requirements by providing surety bonds, letters of credit,
    insurance policies or trust deposits. The amount of the
    financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and
    post-closure costs is determined by applicable state
    environmental regulations. The financial assurance requirements
    for capping, closure and post-closure costs may be associated
    with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill.
    Generally, states will require a third-party engineering
    specialist to determine the estimated capping, closure and
    post-closure costs that are used to determine the required
    amount of financial assurance for a landfill. The amount of
    financial assurance required can, and generally will, differ
    from the obligation determined and recorded under U.S. GAAP. The
    amount of the financial assurance requirements related to
    contract performance varies by contract.

Additionally, we are required to provide financial assurance for
    our insurance program and collateral for certain performance
    obligations. We do not expect a material increase in financial
    assurance requirements during 2010, although the mix of
    financial assurance instruments may change.

These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of
    business and are not debt of our company. Since we currently
    have no liability for these financial assurance instruments,
    they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
    However, we record capping, closure and post-closure liabilities
    and self-insurance liabilities as they are incurred. The
    underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments,
    in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance
    sheets, would be recorded if it is probable that we would be
    unable to fulfill our related obligations. We do not expect this
    to occur.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other
    than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that
    are not classified as debt. We do not guarantee any third-party
    debt.

Free Cash
    Flow

We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP, as cash provided by operating
    activities less purchases of property and equipment, plus
    proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in
    our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Our free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007 is calculated as follows (in millions):




Cash provided by operating activities

Purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our
    consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the
    free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the
    period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and
    equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows
    to property and equipment received during the period for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is as follows

The adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash
    and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements
    of cash flows.

We believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides
    useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by
    operating activities after expenditures for property and
    equipment received, plus proceeds from sales of property and
    equipment. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our
    financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing
    capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service,
    investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer
    base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade
    rating and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, and
    maintaining and improving our market position through business
    optimization. In addition, free cash flow is a key metric used
    to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash flow
    has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent our
    cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it
    excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have
    committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend
    payments. Our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable
    to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Contingencies

    included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Critical
    Accounting Judgments and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP and necessarily include certain
    estimates and judgments made by management. The following is a
    list of accounting policies that we believe are the most
    critical in understanding our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows and that may require
    management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters
    that are inherently uncertain. Such critical accounting
    policies, estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our
    operating segments.

We have noted examples of the residual accounting and business
    risks inherent in the accounting for these areas. Residual
    accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks
    that we face after the application of our policies and processes
    that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast.

Accounting
    for the Acquisition of Allied

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase
    method of accounting. The purchase method of accounting requires
    that the purchase price paid for an acquisition be allocated to
    the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
    estimated fair values as of the effective date of the
    acquisition, with the



excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being
    recorded as goodwill. The consolidated financial statements of
    the acquirer include the operating results of the acquired
    business from the date of the acquisition, and are not
    retroactively restated to include the historical position or the
    results of operations of the acquired business. These estimates
    are revised during the allocation period when the information
    necessary to finalize the fair value estimates is received and
    analyzed, or if information regarding contingencies becomes
    available to further define and quantify the assets and
    liabilities acquired.

We have completed valuing all of the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed in our acquisition of Allied. Adjustments,
    if any, to our estimates of fair values and the resulting
    purchase price allocation in future periods will be reflected in
    our consolidated statement of income. The significant areas of
    accounting where estimates of fair values are reflected in our
    consolidated financial statements include landfills and other
    property and equipment, other intangible assets, landfill asset
    retirement obligations, legal and environmental reserves,
    self-insurance reserves, income taxes, other non-current assets
    and long-term obligations, and assets held for sale. Our
    consolidated financial statements also include our estimates of
    restructuring costs incurred through December 31, 2009, a
    portion of which will be paid in future periods.

Residual risks:

The residual risks identified below related to critical
    accounting judgments and estimates are relevant to the fair
    value estimation processes for acquisitions. For discussion of
    other significant residual risks inherent in the accounting for
    acquisitions, see Item 1A.

Risk Factors

.

Landfill
    Accounting

Landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are
    not discussed further herein.

Our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two
    categories, each of which requires accounting judgments and
    estimates:

•

Landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset.

•

Landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping, closure
    and post-closure liabilities which result in a corresponding
    landfill retirement asset.

Landfill Development Costs

We use life-cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of
    the site. In life-cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and
    construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based
    on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace.
    Obligations associated with final capping, closure and
    post-closure are also capitalized, and amortized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are
    developed at least annually by engineers.

Site permits.

In order to develop, construct and
    operate a landfill, we are required to obtain permits from
    various regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal
    levels. The permitting process requires an initial site study to
    determine whether the location is feasible for landfill
    operations. The initial studies are reviewed by our
    environmental management group and then submitted to the
    regulatory agencies for approval. During the development stage
    we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection
    but prior to the receipt of all required permits if we believe
    that it is probable that the site will be permitted.

Residual risks:

•

Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause
    changes to the landfill site permitting process. These changes
    could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a
    landfill permit.

•

Studies performed could be inaccurate, which could result in the
    denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting
    assumptions. Conditions could exist that were not identified in
    the study, which may make the location not feasible for a
    landfill and could result in the denial of a permit. Denial or
    revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the
    landfill asset.



•

Actions by neighboring parties, private citizen groups or others
    to oppose our efforts to obtain, maintain or expand permits
    could result in denial, revocation or suspension of a permit,
    which could adversely impact the economic viability of the
    landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill. As
    a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit, improved
    technical information as a project progresses, or changes in the
    anticipated economics associated with a project, we may decide
    to reduce the scope of or abandon a project, which could result
    in an asset impairment.

Technical landfill design.

Upon receipt of initial
    regulatory approval, technical landfill designs are prepared.
    The technical designs, which include the detailed specifications
    to develop and construct all components of the landfill,
    including the types and quantities of materials that will be
    required, are reviewed by our environmental management group.
    The technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies
    for approval. Upon approval of the technical designs, the
    regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the
    landfill.

Residual risks:

•

Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require
    changes in the landfill technical design. These changes could
    make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards.

•

Technical design requirements, as approved, may need
    modifications at some future point in time.

•

Technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in
    increased construction costs, difficulty in obtaining a permit
    or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill
    development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not
    appropriate.

Permitted and probable landfill disposal
    capacity.

Included in the technical designs are factors
    that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill.
    These factors include the area over which the landfill will be
    developed, such as the depth of excavation, the height of the
    landfill elevation and the angle of the side-slope construction.
    The disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic
    yards. This measurement of volume is then converted to a
    disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site-specific
    expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating
    life of the landfill.

Residual risks:

•

Estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of
    changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements.

•

The density of waste may vary due to variations in operating
    conditions, including waste compaction practices, site design,
    climate and the nature of the waste.

•

Capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is
    measured in tons. The number of tons per cubic yard varies by
    type of waste.

Development costs.

The types of costs that are
    detailed in the technical design specifications generally
    include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction
    of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas
    collection systems and monitoring probes, installation of
    groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate
    management facilities and other costs associated with the
    development of the site. We review the adequacy of our cost
    estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with
    third-party bids or contractual arrangements, reviewing the
    changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness, and
    comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior
    period costs. These development costs, together with any costs
    incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill, including
    capitalized interest, are recorded to the landfill asset on the
    balance sheet as incurred.

Residual risk:

•

Actual future costs of construction materials and third-party
    labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of
    the availability of the required materials and labor. Technical
    designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions,
    regulatory changes or legislative changes.



Landfill development asset amortization.

In order to
    match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue
    generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill
    development asset over its operating life on a per-ton basis as
    waste is accepted at the landfill. The landfill asset is fully
    amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life. The
    per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill
    development asset net book value plus estimated future
    development costs (as described above) for the landfill by the
    landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity. The
    expected future development costs are not inflated or
    discounted, but rather expressed in nominal dollars. This rate
    is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at
    amortization expense for the period.

Amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of
    the landfill, including acquisition costs, which in turn is
    determined by geographic location and market values. We secure
    significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and
    value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value.
    Amortization rates are also influenced by site-specific
    engineering and cost factors.

Residual risk:

•

Changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal
    capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization
    rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively. An
    unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction
    in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability
    of the landfill and result in asset impairment.

On at least an annual basis, we update the estimates of future
    development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each
    landfill. These costs and disposal capacity estimates are
    reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually.
    Changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected
    prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are
    updated annually.

Landfill Asset Retirement Obligations

We have two types of retirement obligations related to
    landfills: (1) capping and (2) closure and
    post-closure.

Obligations associated with final capping activities that occur
    during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping
    event. Obligations related to closure and post-closure
    activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations
    are recognized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the
    landfill. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the
    related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the

units-of-consumption

method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or
    the airspace consumed within the entire landfill, depending on
    the nature of the obligation. All obligations are initially
    measured at estimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a
    present value basis using an inflation rate and our
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect at the time the
    liabilities were incurred. Future costs for final capping,
    closure and post-closure are developed at least annually by
    engineers, and are inflated to future value using estimated
    future payment dates and inflation rate projections.

Landfill capping.

As individual areas within each
    landfill reach capacity, we are required to cap and close the
    areas in accordance with the landfill site permit. These
    requirements are detailed in the technical design of the
    landfill site process previously described.

Closure and post-closure.

Closure costs are costs
    incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste, but prior
    to being certified as closed. After the entire landfill site has
    reached capacity and is certified closed, we are required to
    maintain and monitor the site for a post-closure period, which
    generally extends for 30 years. Costs associated with
    closure and post-closure requirements generally include
    maintenance of the site and the monitoring of methane gas
    collection systems and groundwater systems, and other activities
    that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste. Costs
    associated with post-closure monitoring generally include
    groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports,
    third-party labor associated with gas system operations and
    maintenance, transportation and disposal of leachate, and
    erosion control costs related to the final cap.

The initial liabilities recorded as part of our acquisition of
    Allied were recorded using provisional amounts based upon
    information available at that time. During 2009, we gathered and
    assessed new information obtained about the facts and
    circumstances surrounding our remediation sites, and as a result
    increased the fair value of our closure and post-closure
    reserves by $72.3 million. Any further adjustments to our
    reserves



resulting in changes in estimate or settlements will be
    reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the periods
    in which such adjustments become known.

Landfill retirement obligation liabilities and
    assets.

Estimates of the total future costs required to
    cap, close and monitor the landfill as specified by each
    landfill permit are updated annually. The estimates include
    inflation, the specific timing of future cash outflows, and the
    anticipated waste flow into the capping events. Our cost
    estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an
    estimate of inflation, which is updated annually (2.5% in both
    2009 and 2008).

The present value of the remaining capping costs for specific
    capping events and the remaining closure and post-closure costs
    for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a per-ton basis.
    These liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed
    at the landfill.

Capping, closure and post-closure liabilities are recorded in
    layers and discounted using our credit-adjusted risk-free rate
    in effect at the time the obligation is incurred (7.5% in 2009
    and 6.6% in 2008).

Retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the
    passage of time by accreting the balance at the same
    credit-adjusted risk-free rate that was used to calculate each
    layer of the recorded liabilities. This accretion expense is
    charged to operating expenses. Actual cash expenditures reduce
    the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made.

Corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the
    same value as the additions to the capping, closure and
    post-closure liabilities. The retirement obligation assets are
    amortized to expense on a per-ton basis as disposal capacity is
    consumed. The per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of
    each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book
    value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation
    asset by the remaining disposal capacity. A per-ton rate is
    determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal
    capacity relating to that event. Closure and post-closure
    per-ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the
    landfill.

Residual risks:

•

Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, including
    changes in capping, closure activities or post-closure
    monitoring activities, types and quantities of materials used,
    or term of post-closure care, could cause changes in our cost
    estimates.

•

Changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in
    the anticipated waste flow, changes in airspace compaction
    estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed
    landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are
    recorded in results of operations prospectively. This could
    result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense.

•

Actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from
    projected timing, causing differences in timing of when
    amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping,
    closure and post-closure liabilities.

•

Changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs
    and our total liabilities.

•

Changes in our capital structure or market conditions could
    result in changes to the credit-adjusted risk-free rate used to
    discount the liabilities, which could cause changes in future
    recorded liabilities, assets and expense.

•

Amortization rates could change in the future based on the
    evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill
    capping design, post-closure monitoring requirements, or the
    inflation or discount rate.

On an annual basis, we update our estimates of future capping,
    closure and post-closure costs and of future disposal capacity
    for each landfill. Revisions in estimates of our costs or timing
    of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or
    decreases to the capping, closure and post-closure liabilities
    and the corresponding retirement obligation assets. Changes in
    the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are
    applied prospectively, except for fully incurred capping events
    and closed landfills, where the changes are recorded immediately
    in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity
    has already been consumed.

In connection with the 2008 annual review of our calculations
    with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations, we made a
    change in estimate, which is considered to be a change in
    accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting
    principle. This change, which we believe is preferable, was made
    to better



align the estimated amount of waste placed in an area to be
    capped (which is used to calculate our capping rates) with the
    physical operation of our landfills. The expected costs related
    to our capping events did not change and we will continue to use
    separate rates for each capping event. This change resulted in a
    $32.6 million decrease in our capping asset retirement
    obligations and related assets. These assets will be amortized
    to expense prospectively as a change in estimate. This change in
    estimate will not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Permitted and probable disposal capacity.

As
    described previously, disposal capacity is determined by the
    specifications detailed in the landfill permit. We classify this
    disposal capacity as permitted. We also include probable
    expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity
    estimates, thus including additional disposal capacity being
    sought through means of a permit expansion. Probable expansion
    disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the
    applicable regulatory agencies, but we have determined that
    certain critical criteria have been met and the successful
    completion of the expansion is probable. We have developed six
    criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated
    as probable expansion airspace. We believe that satisfying all
    of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion
    airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be
    permitted. However, because some of these criteria are
    judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will
    eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will
    not be permitted. In either of these scenarios, our
    amortization, depletion and accretion expense could change
    significantly. Our internal criteria to classify disposal
    capacity as probable expansion are as follows:

•

We own the land associated with the expansion airspace or
    control it pursuant to an option agreement;

•

We are committed to supporting the expansion project financially
    and with appropriate resources;

•

There are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated
    with the project, including political impediments;

•

Progress is being made on the project;

•

The expansion is attainable within a reasonable time
    frame; and

•

We believe it is likely the expansion permit will be received.

After successfully meeting these criteria, the disposal capacity
    that will result from the planned expansion is included in our
    remaining disposal capacity estimates. Additionally, for
    purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping,
    closure and post-closure rates, we include the incremental costs
    to develop, construct, close and monitor the related probable
    expansion disposal capacity.

Residual risk:

•

We may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable
    expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the
    final local, state or federal permits or due to other unknown
    reasons. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for
    probable expansion disposal capacity, or the disposal capacity
    for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated,
    both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be
    reduced, which generally increases the rates we charge for
    landfill amortization and capping, closure and post-closure
    accruals. An unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also
    cause an asset impairment.

Environmental
    Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to
    the protection of the environment, and we remediate sites in the
    ordinary course of our business. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation
    at sites that we either own or operate, including sites that we
    have acquired, or sites where we have (or a company that we have
    acquired has) delivered waste. Our environmental remediation
    liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating
    groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as
    controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related
    legal costs. To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites,
    we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of
    contamination at each identified site, the required remediation
    methods, the apportionment of responsibility among the
    potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of
    those parties. We accrue for costs associated with environmental
    remediation obligations when such costs are probable and
    reasonably estimable



in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies. We
    periodically review the status of all environmental matters and
    update our estimates of the likelihood of and future
    expenditures for remediation as necessary. Changes in the
    liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized
    currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is
    known. Adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the
    near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts. We have
    not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from
    other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies.

The environmental liabilities assumed from Allied relate to
    impacts at both owned and unowned sites. In the case of owned
    sites, we are actively working with the appropriate regulatory
    entity under the applicable regulations (typically RCRA or
    CERCLA) to characterize and remediate potential issues. At
    unowned sites, we are working within the regulatory and
    procedural framework established by CERCLA to characterize and
    remediate potential issues, in conjunction with other
    potentially liable parties at each location. Pursuant to the
    purchase method of accounting, we have recorded the
    environmental remediation liabilities assumed from Allied based
    upon estimates of their fair value, using an estimate of future
    cash flows or settlement. Previously, and consistent with our
    method of accounting, Allied recorded remediation liabilities
    based upon accounting for loss contingencies, however, amounts
    recorded under this method are generally not at fair value.

Since the date of acquisition, our process for deriving fair
    value for the environmental liabilities assumed from Allied
    included first identifying the population of remediation sites
    where we are either fully or partially responsible for
    remediation or potential remediation. The population of
    remediation sites was then stratified into categories based on
    (i) the maturity of the issue relative to recognized stages
    in the applicable regulation (typically CERCLA or RCRA) and
    (ii) the extent of our participation in the remediation
    activity. Using these categories, we applied one of the
    following multiple estimation processes to quantify fair value:

•

For sites with established responsibility but a high level of
    uncertainty with the outcome of the remedial process, we
    developed multiple remediation scenarios. We then probability
    weighted the remediation scenarios to develop a fair value
    estimate.

•

For sites where the level of responsibility was less defined, we
    developed a fair value estimate of the settlement costs based
    upon market participant assessments from external legal counsel.

•

For sites which we own and are in the earliest stages of the
    remedial process, we identified the most applicable standard
    remedial techniques and then probability weighted the use of
    each technique to develop a fair value estimate.

•

For the remaining sites with low levels of uncertainty, we
    developed a primary remedial strategy and cost estimate to
    determine the fair value of the liability.

The initial liabilities recorded as part of our acquisition of
    Allied were recorded using provisional amounts based upon
    information available at that time. During 2009, we gathered and
    assessed new information obtained about the facts and
    circumstances surrounding Allied’s remediation sites. In
    certain situations, we used external engineers and attorneys to
    assist in the development of our fair value estimates. As a
    result of the process, we increased the fair value of our
    remediation reserves by $181.9 million. Any further
    adjustments to our remediation reserves resulting from changes
    in estimates or reserve settlements will be reflected currently
    in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments become
    known.

Residual risks:

•

We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our
    environmental remediation liabilities. Our estimates of these
    liabilities require assumptions about future events that are
    uncertain. Consequently, our estimates could change
    substantially as additional information becomes available
    regarding the nature or extent of contamination, the required
    remediation methods, the final apportionment of responsibility
    among the potentially responsible parties identified, the
    financial viability of those parties, and the actions of
    governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the
    matter.

•

Actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a
    result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue
    the matter to ultimate resolution.



•

An unanticipated environmental liability that arises could
    result in a material charge to our consolidated statement of
    income.

Self-Insurance
    Reserves and Related Costs

Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. Accruals for
    self-insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates
    of claims incurred but not reported. We maintain high
    deductibles for commercial general liability, automobile
    liability and workers’ compensation coverage, ranging from
    $1.0 million to $3.0 million.

Residual risks:

•

Incident rates, including frequency and severity, and other
    actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and
    future actuarially determined obligations to change, which would
    be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the
    period in which such adjustment is known.

•

It is possible that recorded reserves may not be adequate to
    cover the future payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to
    estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments would
    be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the
    periods in which such adjustments are known.

•

The settlement costs to discharge our obligations, including
    legal and health care costs, could increase or decrease causing
    current estimates of our self-insurance reserves to change.

Loss
    Contingencies

We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and
    regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to
    significant uncertainty. We determine whether to disclose or
    accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether
    the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable, and
    whether it can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our
    litigation and regulatory matters based on available information
    to assess the potential liabilities. Management’s
    assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible
    outcomes under various strategies. We record and disclose loss
    contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for
    such matter.

We record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations
    or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on
    the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss
    contingency.

Residual risks:

•

Actual costs can vary from our estimates for a variety of
    reasons, including differing interpretations of laws, opinions
    on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages.

•

Loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are
    inherently subjective and generally involve business matters
    that are by their nature unpredictable. If a loss contingency
    results in an adverse judgment or is settled for significant
    amounts, it could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, result of operations or cash
    flows in the period in which such judgment or settlement occurs.

Asset
    Impairment

Valuation methodology.

We evaluate our long-lived
    assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset
    group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows
    anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those
    assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets.

Residual risk:

•

If events or changes in circumstances occur, including
    reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations
    or determinations to divest assets, certain assets could be
    impaired which would result in a non-cash charge to earnings.



Evaluation criteria.

We test long-lived assets for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.
    Examples of such events could include a significant adverse
    change in the extent or manner in which we use a long-lived
    asset, a change in its physical condition, or new circumstances
    that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not
    that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long-lived asset
    significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
    life.

Residual risk:

•

Our most significant asset impairment exposure, other than
    goodwill (which is discussed below) relates to our landfills. A
    significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a
    result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments,
    revocation of an existing permit or denial of an expansion
    permit, or changes in our assumptions used to calculate disposal
    capacity, could trigger an impairment charge.

Recognition criteria.

If such circumstances arise,
    we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying
    amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the
    asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows
    expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. We
    generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from
    that asset to determine fair value.

Goodwill
    Recoverability

We annually test goodwill at December 31 for impairment using
    the two-step process. The first step is a screen for potential
    impairment, while the second step measures the amount of the
    impairment, if any. The first step of the goodwill impairment
    test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its
    carrying amount, including goodwill.

We have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our
    operating segments: Eastern, Midwest, Southern, and Western. In
    determining fair value, we primarily utilize discounted future
    cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple
    of earnings or revenues.

Significant estimates used in our fair value calculation
    utilizing discounted future cash flows include, but are not
    limited to: (i) estimates of future revenue and expense
    growth by reporting unit, which we estimate to range from 3% to
    5%; (ii) future estimated effective tax rates, which we
    estimate to be 40%; (iii) future estimated capital
    expenditures as well as future required investments in working
    capital; (iv) estimated discount rates, which we estimate
    to range between 8% and 10%; and (v) the future terminal
    value of the reporting unit, which is based on its ability to
    exist into perpetuity. Significant estimates used in the fair
    value calculation utilizing market value multiples include but
    are not limited to: (i) estimated future growth potential
    of the reporting unit; (ii) estimated multiples of revenue
    or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay; and
    (iii) estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely
    to pay.

In addition, we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if
    events or circumstances change between annual tests, indicating
    a possible impairment. Examples of such events or circumstances
    include: (i) a significant adverse change in legal factors
    or in the business climate; (ii) an adverse action or
    assessment by a regulator; (iii) a more likely than not
    expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion
    thereof will be sold; (iv) continued or sustained losses at
    a reporting unit; (v) a significant decline in our market
    capitalization as compared to our book value; or (vi) the
    testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within
    the reporting unit.

We assign assets and liabilities from our corporate reporting
    segment to our four operating segments to the extent that such
    assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting
    unit and would be included in determining the reporting
    unit’s fair value.

In preparing our annual test for impairment as of
    December 31, 2009, we determined that the aggregate sum of
    our reporting unit fair values exceeded our market
    capitalization. We determined market capitalization as the fair
    value of our common shares outstanding at the closing market
    price on December 31, 2009. We believe one of the primary
    reconciling differences between fair value and our market
    capitalization is due to a



control premium. We believe the control premium represents the
    value a market participant could extract as savings
    and / or synergies by obtaining control, and thereby
    eliminating duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting
    from the consolidation of routes and internalization of waste
    streams.

As of December 31, 2009, we determined that the indicated
    fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of
    our reporting units by a range of 125% to 150% and, as such, we
    noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units.

We will continuously monitor market trends in our business, the
    related expected cash flows and our calculation of market
    capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators
    of impairment. If our book value per share exceeds our market
    price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment, we
    will be required to perform an interim step one impairment
    analysis, which may lead to a step two analysis and possible
    impairment of our goodwill. Additionally, we would then be
    required to review our remaining long-lived assets for
    impairment.

Our operating segments, which also represent our reporting
    units, are comprised of several vertically integrated
    businesses. When an individual business within an integrated
    operating segment is divested, goodwill is allocated to that
    business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of
    its operating segment.

Residual risks:

•

Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment
    indicators exist and that goodwill associated with acquired
    businesses is impaired.

•

The valuation of identifiable goodwill requires significant
    estimates and judgment about future performance, cash flows and
    fair value. Our future results could be affected if these
    current estimates of future performance and fair value change.
    For example, a reduction in long-term growth assumptions could
    reduce the estimated fair value of the operating segments to
    below their carrying values, which could trigger an impairment
    charge. Similarly, an increase in our discount rate could
    trigger an impairment charge. Any resulting impairment charge
    could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition
    and results of operations.

Income
    Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
    differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases
    of assets (other than non-deductible goodwill) and liabilities.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the
    income tax rate in effect during the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse.

We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these
    assets will more likely than not be realized. In making this
    determination, we consider all available positive and negative
    evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax
    liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning
    strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we
    determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income
    tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount,
    we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which
    would reduce our provision for income taxes.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted new guidance which
    clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized in the financial statements. This new guidance
    provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may
    be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position
    will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any
    related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical
    merits. This new guidance also provides guidance on measurement,
    de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, and
    accounting in interim periods.

We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
    positions within the provision for income taxes in our
    consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and
    penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and
    deferred income taxes and other long-term tax liabilities in our
    consolidated balance sheets.



Residual risks:

•

Income tax assets and liabilities established in purchase
    accounting for acquisitions are based on assumptions that could
    differ from the ultimate outcome of the tax matters. Such
    adjustments would be charged or credited to earnings, unless
    they meet certain remeasurement criteria and are allowed to be
    adjusted to goodwill.

•

Changes in the estimated realizability of deferred tax assets
    could result in adjustments to our provision for income taxes.

•

Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the
    realizability of net operating loss carryforwards for tax
    purposes are based on our judgment. If our judgments and
    estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability
    of net operating loss carryforwards are incorrect, our provision
    for income taxes would change.

•

We are currently under examination or administrative review by
    various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax
    years. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and income tax
    regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to
    interpret and apply. Positions taken in tax years under
    examination or subsequent years are subject to challenge.
    Accordingly, we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities
    arising from these audits if any positions taken by us or by
    companies we have acquired are disallowed by the taxing
    authorities.

•

We adjust our liabilities for uncertain tax positions when our
    judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new
    information not previously available. Due to the complexity of
    some of these uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may
    result in payments that are materially different from our
    current estimates of the tax liabilities. These differences will
    be reflected as increases or decreases to our provision for
    income taxes in the period in which they are determined.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans

We currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan,
    the BFI Retirement Plan (the Plan). The Plan covers certain
    employees in the United States, including some employees subject
    to collective bargaining agreements. The Plan’s benefit
    formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in
    the Plan document. The benefits of approximately 97% of the
    current plan participants were frozen upon Allied’s
    acquisition of BFI in 1999.

Our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding
    standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security
    Act of 1974 and IRC, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of
    2006. No contributions were required during the last three years
    and no contributions are required for 2010.

The Plan’s assets are invested as determined by our
    Retirement Benefits Committee. At December 31, 2009, the
    plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds, equity
    funds and cash. We annually review and adjust the plan’s
    asset allocation as deemed necessary.

Residual risk:

•

Changes in the plan’s investment mix and performance of the
    equity and bond markets and fund managers could impact the
    amount of pension income or expense recorded, the funded status
    of the plan and the need for future cash contributions.

Assumptions.

The benefit obligation and associated
    income or expense related to the Plan are determined based on
    assumptions concerning items such as discount rates, expected
    rates of return and average rates of compensation increases. Our
    assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed
    necessary.

We determine the discount rate based on a model which matches
    the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities
    of high quality bonds priced as of the Plan measurement date.
    Where that timing does not correspond to a published
    high-quality bond rate, our model uses an expected yield curve
    to determine an appropriate current discount rate. The yield on
    the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability.
    If the discount rate increases by 1%, our benefit obligation
    would decrease by approximately $31.5 million. If



the discount rate were to decrease by 1%, our benefit obligation
    would increase by approximately $36.6 million.

In developing our expected rate of return assumption, we
    evaluate long-term expected and historical returns on the Plan
    assets, giving consideration to our asset mix and the
    anticipated duration of the Plan obligations. The average rate
    of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average
    pay increases over the periods benefits are earned. Less than 3%
    of participants in the Plan continue to earn service benefits.

Residual risks:

•

Our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in
    market-based interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate
    will increase our related benefit plan obligation.

•

Our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual
    return on plan assets were to vary from the expected return.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is
    changing interest rates in the United States and fluctuations in
    LIBOR. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of
    a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. The carrying
    value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because
    interest rates are variable and, accordingly, approximates
    current market rates for instruments with similar risk and
    maturities. The fair value of our debt is determined as of the
    balance sheet date and is subject to change. The table below
    provides information about certain of our market-sensitive
    financial instruments and constitutes a “forward-looking
    statement”.

Fuel
    Price Risk

Fuel costs represent a significant operating expense. When
    economically practical, we may enter into new or renewal
    contracts, or engage in other strategies to mitigate market
    risk. Where appropriate, we have implemented a fuel recovery fee
    that is designed to recover our fuel costs. While we charge
    these fees to a majority of our customers, we are unable to
    charge such fees to all customers. Consequently, an increase in
    fuel costs results in



(1) an increase in our cost of operations, (2) a
    smaller increase in our revenue (from the fuel recovery fee) and
    (3) a decrease in our operating margin percentage, because
    the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in
    cost. Conversely, a decrease in fuel costs results in (1) a
    decrease in our cost of operations, (2) a smaller decrease
    in our revenue and (3) an increase in our operating margin
    percentage.

At our current consumption levels, a one-cent change in the
    price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately
    $1.5 million on an annual basis, which would be partially
    offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to
    our customers. Accordingly, a substantial rise or drop in fuel
    costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost
    of operations.

Our operations also require the use of certain
    petrochemical-based products (such as liners at our landfills)
    whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals. An
    increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost
    of those products, which would increase our operating and
    capital costs. We are also susceptible to increases in indirect
    fuel surcharges from our vendors.

Commodities
    Prices

We market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Republic Services,
    Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Republic Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Republic Services, Inc. and subsidiaries
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Republic Services, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Republic Services,
    Inc.:

We have audited Republic Services, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Republic Services,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of
    Management on Republic Services, Inc.’s Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Republic Services, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Republic Services, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
    equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 of
    Republic Services, Inc. and our report dated February 24,
    2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION

Republic Services, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and its
    subsidiaries (also referred to collectively as Republic, we, us,
    our, or the Company in this report) is the second largest
    provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer,
    recycling and disposal services in the United States, as
    measured by revenue. We manage and evaluate our operations
    through four geographic regions — Eastern, Midwest,
    Southern, and Western, which we have identified as our
    reportable segments. We acquired Allied Waste Industries, Inc.
    (Allied) on December 5, 2008, and have included all of the
    operating results of Allied starting on that date in our
    consolidated financial statements. See Note 3,

Business
    Acquisitions and Divestitures, Assets Held for Sale and
    Restructuring Charges,

for additional information.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Republic, its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (U.S. GAAP). We account for
    investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling
    financial interest under either the equity method or cost method
    of accounting, as appropriate. Our investments in variable
    interest entities are not material to our consolidated financial
    statements. All material intercompany accounts and transactions
    have been eliminated in consolidation.

In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a

3-for-2

stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effective on
    March 16, 2007, to stockholders of record as of
    March 5, 2007. Our shares, per share amounts, and weighted
    average common and common equivalent shares have been adjusted
    to reflect the stock split.

For comparative purposes, certain prior year amounts have been
    reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. All
    amounts are in millions, except per share amounts and unless
    otherwise noted.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Management’s
    Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
    estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting,
    recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities,
    stockholders’ equity, revenue and expenses. We must make
    these estimates and assumptions because certain information that
    we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with
    a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot
    be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies.
    In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to
    determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In
    preparing our financial statements, the most difficult,
    subjective and complex estimates and assumptions that deal with
    the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for
    our long-lived assets, landfill development costs, and final
    capping, closure and post-closure costs, our valuation
    allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets, our
    liabilities for potential litigation, claims and assessments,
    our liabilities for environmental remediation, employee benefit
    plans, deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions and
    self-insurance, and our estimates of the fair values of the
    assets and liabilities acquired in our acquisition of Allied.
    Each of these items is discussed in more detail in the following
    discussion. Our actual results may differ significantly from our
    estimates.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

We consider liquid investments with an original maturity of
    three months or less to be cash equivalents.

We may have net book credit balances in our primary disbursement
    accounts at the end of a reporting period. We classify such
    credit balances as accounts payable in our consolidated balance
    sheets as checks presented for payment to these accounts are not
    payable by our banks under overdraft arrangements, and, as such,
    do not represent short-term borrowings. As of December 31,
    2008, there were no net book credit balances in our primary
    disbursement accounts. As of December 31, 2009, there were
    net book credit balances of $89.9 million

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

in our primary disbursement accounts which were reclassified as
    accounts payable and other accrued liabilities on our
    consolidated balance sheet.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash
    equivalents, trade accounts receivable and derivative
    instruments. We place our cash and cash equivalents with high
    quality financial institutions. Such balances may be in excess
    of FDIC insured limits. In order to manage the related credit
    exposure, we continually monitor the credit worthiness of the
    financial institutions where we have deposits. Concentrations of
    credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are
    limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in
    which we provide services, as well as the dispersion of our
    operations across many geographic areas. We provide services to
    commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers in
    the United States and Puerto Rico. We perform ongoing credit
    evaluations of our customers, but do not require collateral to
    support customer receivables. We establish an allowance for
    doubtful accounts based on various factors including the credit
    risk of specific customers, age of receivables outstanding,
    historical trends, economic conditions and other information. No
    customer exceeded 5% of our outstanding accounts receivable
    balance at December 31, 2009 or 2008.

Accounts
    Receivable, Net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable represent receivables from customers for
    collection, transfer, recycling, disposal and other services.
    Our receivables are recorded when billed or when the related
    revenue is earned, if earlier, and represent claims against
    third parties that will be settled in cash. The carrying value
    of our receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts,
    represents their estimated net realizable value. Provisions for
    doubtful accounts are evaluated on a monthly basis and are
    recorded based on our historical collection experience, the age
    of the receivables, specific customer information and economic
    conditions. We also review outstanding balances on an
    account-specific basis. In general, reserves are provided for
    accounts receivable in excess of ninety days old. Past due
    receivable balances are written-off when our collection efforts
    have been unsuccessful in collecting amounts due.

The following table reflects the activity in our allowance for
    doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007:

Subsequent to our acquisition of Allied, we recorded a provision

    allowance acquired from Allied to conform to Republic’s
    accounting policies. We also recorded $5.4 million to
    provide for specific bankruptcy exposures in 2008.

In 2007, we recorded a $4.3 million reduction in our
    allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of refining our
    estimate of the allowance based on our historical collection
    experience.

Restricted
    Cash

As of December 31, 2009, we had $236.6 million of
    restricted cash, of which $93.1 million was proceeds from
    the issuance of tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings
    and will be used to fund capital

    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

expenditures under the terms of the applicable agreements.
    Restricted cash also includes amounts held in trust as a
    guarantee of performance.

We obtain funds through the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for the
    purpose of financing qualifying expenditures at our landfills,
    transfer stations, and collection and recycling facilities. The
    funds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding
    authorities at the time of issuance. As we do not have the
    ability to use these funds for general operating purposes, they
    are classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance
    sheets.

In the normal course of business, we may be required to provide
    financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of
    other entities in connection with municipal residential
    collection contracts, the operation, closure or post-closure of
    landfills, environmental remediation, environmental permits, and
    business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our
    performance. At several of our landfills, we satisfy financial
    assurance requirements by depositing cash into restricted trust
    funds or escrow accounts.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for
    major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized,
    while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
    incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the
    related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
    accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the
    consolidated statements of income.

We revise the estimated useful lives of property and equipment
    acquired through business acquisitions to conform with our
    policies regarding property and equipment. Depreciation is
    provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets involved
    using the straight-line method. We assume no salvage value for
    our depreciable property and equipment. The estimated useful
    lives of our property and equipment are as follows:

Estimated

Useful

Lives

Buildings and improvements

7 - 40 years

Vehicles

5 - 12 years

Landfill equipment

7 - 10 years

Other equipment

3 - 15 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 - 12 years

Landfill development costs are also included in property and
    equipment. Landfill development costs include direct costs
    incurred to obtain landfill permits and direct costs incurred to
    acquire, construct and develop sites as well as final capping,
    closure and post-closure assets. These costs are amortized or
    depleted based on consumed airspace. All indirect landfill
    development costs are expensed as incurred. (For additional
    information, see

Landfill and Environmental Costs.

)

Capitalized
    Interest

We capitalize interest on landfill cell construction and other
    construction projects if they meet the following criteria:

1.  Total construction costs are $50,000 or greater,

2.  The construction phase is one month or
    longer, and

3.  The assets have a useful life of one year or
    longer.

Interest is capitalized on qualified assets while they undergo
    activities to ready them for their intended use. Capitalization
    of interest ceases once an asset is placed into service or if
    construction activity is suspended for more than a brief period
    of time. Our interest capitalization rate is based on our
    weighted average cost of



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

indebtedness. Interest capitalized was $7.8 million,
    $2.6 million and $3.0 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents,
    restricted cash and marketable securities, accounts receivable,
    accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt and the
    assets in our defined benefit plan. The fair value hierarchy
    under U.S. GAAP distinguishes between assumptions based on
    market data (observable inputs) and an entity’s own
    assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of
    three levels:

•

Level one – Quoted market prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities;

•

Level two – Inputs other than level one inputs that
    are either directly or indirectly observable; and

•

Level three – Unobservable inputs developed using
    estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting
    entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant
    would use.

We have determined the estimated fair values of our financial
    instruments using available market information and commonly
    accepted valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment
    is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates
    of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not necessarily
    indicative of the amounts that we, or holders of the
    instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use
    of different assumptions or valuation methodologies could have a
    material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The fair
    value estimates are based on information available as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. These amounts have not been
    revalued since those dates, and current estimates of fair value
    could differ significantly from the amounts presented.

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash
    and marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable
    and accrued liabilities approximate their respective fair values
    due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. See
    Note 9,

Debt

, for the fair value disclosures related
    to our long-term debt.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments to manage our risk
    associated with changing interest rates and changing prices for
    commodities we frequently purchase or sell by creating
    offsetting market exposures. We use interest rate swap
    agreements to manage risk associated with fluctuations in
    interest rates. We have entered into multiple agreements
    designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate some of our exposure
    to changes in diesel fuel prices and prices of certain
    commodities.

All derivatives are measured at fair value and recognized in the
    balance sheet as assets or liabilities, as appropriate. For
    derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair
    value of the effective portions of derivative instruments are
    reported in stockholders’ equity as components of other
    comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or
    is not probable of occurring. When the forecasted transaction
    occurs or is not probable of occurring, the realized net gain or
    loss is then recognized in the consolidated statements of
    income. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of
    derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings.

The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements and the
    fair values of our diesel fuel and other commodity hedges are
    obtained from third-party counter-parties and are determined
    using standard valuation models with assumptions about prices
    and other relevant information based on those observed in the
    underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).
    The estimated fair values of derivatives used to hedge risks
    fluctuate over time and should be viewed in relation to the
    underlying hedged transactions.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We annually test goodwill at December 31 for impairment using
    the two-step process. The first step is a screen for potential
    impairment, while the second step measures the amount of the
    impairment, if any. The first step of the goodwill impairment
    test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its
    carrying amount, including goodwill.

We have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our
    operating segments: Eastern, Midwest, Southern, and Western. In
    determining fair value, we primarily utilize discounted future
    cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple
    of earnings or revenues.

Significant estimates used in our fair value calculation
    utilizing discounted future cash flows include, but are not
    limited to: (i) estimates of future revenue and expense
    growth by reporting unit, which we estimate to range from 3% to
    5%; (ii) future estimated effective tax rates, which we
    estimate to be 40%; (iii) future estimated capital
    expenditures as well as future required investments in working
    capital; (iv) estimated discount rates, which we estimate
    to range between 8% and 10%; and (v) the future terminal
    value of the reporting unit, which is based on its ability to
    exist into perpetuity. Significant estimates used in the fair
    value calculation utilizing market value multiples include but
    are not limited to: (i) estimated future growth potential
    of the reporting unit; (ii) estimated multiples of revenue
    or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay; and
    (iii) estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely
    to pay.

In addition, we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if
    events or circumstances change between annual tests, indicating
    a possible impairment. Examples of such events or circumstances
    include: (i) a significant adverse change in legal factors
    or in the business climate; (ii) an adverse action or
    assessment by a regulator; (iii) a more likely than not
    expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion
    thereof will be sold; (iv) continued or sustained losses at
    a reporting unit; (v) a significant decline in our market
    capitalization as compared to our book value or (vi) the
    testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within
    the reporting unit.

We assign assets and liabilities from our corporate reporting
    segment to our four operating segments to the extent that such
    assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting
    unit and would be included in determining the reporting
    unit’s fair value.

In preparing our annual test for impairment as of
    December 31, 2009, we determined that the aggregate sum of
    our reporting unit fair values exceeded our market
    capitalization. We determined market capitalization as the fair
    value of our common shares outstanding at the closing market
    price on December 31, 2009. We believe one of the primary
    reconciling differences between fair value and our market
    capitalization is due to a control premium. We believe the
    control premium represents the value a market participant could
    extract as savings and / or synergies by obtaining
    control, and thereby eliminating duplicative overhead and
    operating costs resulting from the consolidation of routes and
    internalization of waste streams.

As of December 31, 2009, we determined that the indicated
    fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of
    our reporting units by a range of 125% to 150% and, as such, we
    noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units.

We will continuously monitor market trends in our business, the
    related expected cash flows and our calculation of market
    capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators
    of impairment. If our book value per share exceeds our market
    price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment, we
    will be required to perform an interim step one impairment
    analysis, which may lead to a step two analysis and possible
    impairment of our goodwill. Additionally, we would then be
    required to review our remaining long-lived assets for
    impairment.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

Our operating segments, which also represent our reporting
    units, are comprised of several vertically integrated
    businesses. When an individual business within an integrated
    operating segment is divested, goodwill is allocated to that
    business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of
    its operating segment.

Other intangible assets include values assigned to customer
    relationships, long-term contracts, covenants not to compete and
    trade names, and are amortized generally on a straight-line
    basis over periods ranging from 2 to 23 years.

Landfill
    and Environmental Costs

Life
    Cycle Accounting

We use life-cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the
    site. In life cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and
    construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based
    on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace.

Costs and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers. We use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to
    deplete capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily
    relate to changes in available airspace, inflation and
    applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include
    but are not limited to changes due to the addition of airspace
    lying in probable expansion areas, airspace consumed and changes
    in engineering estimates.

Total
    Available Disposal Capacity

As of December 31, 2009, we owned or operated 192 active
    solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity of
    approximately 4.6 billion in-place cubic yards. Total
    available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated
    permitted airspace plus our estimate of expansion airspace that
    has a probable likelihood of being permitted.

Probable
    Expansion Airspace

We classify landfill disposal capacity as either permitted
    (having received the final permit from the applicable regulatory
    agency) or as probable expansion airspace. Before airspace
    included in an expansion area is determined to be probable
    expansion airspace and, therefore, is included in our
    calculation of total available disposal capacity, the following
    criteria must be met:

•

We own the land associated with the expansion airspace or
    control it pursuant to an option agreement,

•

We are committed to supporting the expansion project financially
    and with appropriate resources,

•

There are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated
    with the project, including political impediments,

•

Progress is being made on the project,

•

The expansion is attainable within a reasonable time
    frame, and

•

We believe it is likely the expansion permit will be received.

Upon meeting our expansion criteria, the rates used at each
    applicable landfill to expense costs to acquire, construct, cap,
    close and maintain a site during the post-closure period are
    adjusted to include both the probable expansion airspace and the
    additional costs to be capitalized or accrued associated with
    that expansion airspace.

We have identified three steps that landfills generally follow
    to obtain expansion permits. These steps are as follows:

1.  Obtaining approval from local authorities,

2.  Submitting a permit application to state
    authorities, and

3.  Obtaining permit approval from state authorities.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

We continually monitor our progress toward obtaining permits for
    each of our sites with probable airspace. If at any point it is
    determined that a landfill expansion area no longer meets our
    criteria, the probable expansion airspace is removed from the
    landfill’s total available capacity and the rates used at
    the landfill to deplete costs to acquire, construct, cap, close
    and maintain a site during the post-closure period are adjusted
    accordingly. In addition, any amounts capitalized for the
    probable expansion airspace are charged to expense in the period
    in which it is determined that the criteria are no longer met.

Capitalized
    Landfill Costs

Capitalized landfill costs include expenditures for land,
    permitting, cell construction and environmental structures.
    Capitalized permitting and cell construction costs are limited
    to direct costs relating to these activities, including legal,
    engineering and construction costs associated with excavation,
    natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate
    collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and
    monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells
    and other costs associated with the development of the site.
    Interest is capitalized on landfill construction projects while
    the assets are undergoing activities to ready them for their
    intended use. Capitalized landfill costs also include final
    capping, closure and post-closure assets and are depleted as
    airspace is consumed using the

units-of-consumption

method.

Costs related to acquiring land, excluding the estimated
    residual value of unpermitted, non-buffer land, and costs
    related to permitting and cell construction are depleted as
    airspace is consumed using the

units-of-consumption

method.

Capitalized landfill costs may also include an allocation of
    purchase price paid for landfills. For landfills purchased as
    part of a group of assets, the purchase price assigned to the
    landfill is determined based on the estimated fair value of the
    landfill relative to the fair value of other assets within the
    acquired group. If the landfill meets our expansion criteria,
    the purchase price is further allocated between permitted
    airspace and expansion airspace based on the ratio of permitted
    versus probable expansion airspace to total available airspace.
    Landfill purchase price is amortized using the

units-of-consumption

method over the total available airspace including probable
    expansion airspace where appropriate.

Final
    Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

We have future obligations for final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs with respect to the landfills we own or
    operate as set forth in applicable landfill permits. Final
    capping, closure and post-closure costs include estimated costs
    to be incurred for final capping and closure of landfills and
    estimated costs for providing required post-closure monitoring
    and maintenance of landfills. The permit requirements are based
    on the Subtitle C and Subtitle D regulations of the Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as implemented and applied
    on a

state-by-state

basis. Obligations associated with monitoring and controlling
    methane gas migration and emissions are set forth in applicable
    landfill permits and these requirements are based on the
    provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended. Final
    capping typically includes installing flexible membrane and
    geosynthetic clay liners, drainage and compact soil layers, and
    topsoil, and is constructed over an area of the landfill where
    total airspace capacity has been consumed and waste disposal
    operations have ceased. These final capping activities occur as
    needed throughout the operating life of a landfill. Other
    closure activities and post-closure activities occur after the
    entire landfill ceases to accept waste and closes. These
    activities involve methane gas control, leachate management and
    groundwater monitoring, surface water monitoring and control,
    and other operational and maintenance activities that occur
    after the site ceases to accept waste. The post-closure period
    generally runs for up to 30 years after final site closure
    for municipal solid waste landfills and a shorter period for
    construction and demolition landfills and inert landfills.

Estimates of future expenditures for final capping, closure and
    post-closure are developed at least annually by engineers. These
    estimates are reviewed by management and are used by our
    operating and accounting



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

personnel to adjust the rates used to capitalize and amortize
    these costs. These estimates involve projections of costs that
    will be incurred during the remaining life of the landfill for
    final capping activities, after the landfill ceases operations
    and during the legally required post-closure monitoring period.
    We currently retain post-closure responsibility for 132 closed
    landfills.

A liability for an asset retirement obligation must be
    recognized in the period in which it is incurred and should be
    initially measured at fair value. Absent quoted market prices,
    the estimate of fair value is based on the best available
    information, including the results of present value techniques.
    The offset to the liability is capitalized as part of the
    carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Changes in the
    liabilities due to the passage of time are recognized as
    operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income and
    are referred to as accretion expense. Changes in the liabilities
    due to revisions to estimated future cash flows are recognized
    by increasing or decreasing the liabilities with the offsets
    adjusting the carrying amounts of the related long-lived assets,
    and may also require immediate adjustments to amortization
    expense in the consolidated statement of income.

Landfill asset retirement obligations include estimates of all
    costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure. Costs
    associated with daily maintenance activities during the
    operating life of the landfill, such as leachate disposal,
    groundwater and gas monitoring, and other pollution control
    activities, are charged to expense as incurred. In addition,
    costs historically accounted for as capital expenditures during
    the operating life of a landfill, such as cell development
    costs, are capitalized when incurred, and charged to expense
    using life cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method based on the consumption of cubic yards of available
    airspace.

We define final capping as activities required to permanently
    cover a portion of a landfill that has been completely filled
    with waste. Final capping occurs in phases as needed throughout
    the operating life of a landfill as specific areas are filled to
    capacity and the final elevation for that specific area is
    reached in accordance with the provisions of the operating
    permit. We consider final capping events to be discrete
    activities that are recognized as asset retirement obligations
    separately from other closure and post-closure obligations.
    These capping events generally occur during the operating life
    of a landfill and can be associated with waste placed in an area
    to be capped. As a result, we use a separate rate per ton for
    recognizing the principal amount of the liability and related
    asset associated with each capping event. We amortize the asset
    recorded pursuant to this approach as waste volume related to
    the capacity covered by the capping event is placed into the
    landfill based on the consumption of cubic yards of available
    airspace.

In connection with the 2008 annual review of our calculations
    with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations, we made a
    change in estimate, which is considered to be a change in
    accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting
    principle. This change, which we believe is preferable, was made
    to better align the estimated amount of waste to be placed in an
    area to be capped (which is used to calculate our capping rates)
    with the physical operation of our landfills. The expected costs
    related to our capping events did not change and we will
    continue to use separate rates for each capping event. This
    change resulted in a $32.6 million decrease in our capping
    asset retirement obligations and related assets. These assets
    will be amortized to expense prospectively as a change in
    estimate. This change in estimate did not have a material impact
    on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

We recognize asset retirement obligations and the related
    amortization expense for closure and post-closure (excluding
    obligations for final capping) using the

units-of-consumption

method over the total remaining capacity of the landfill. The
    total remaining capacity includes probable expansion airspace.

In general, we engage third parties to perform most of our final
    capping, closure and post-closure activities. Accordingly, the
    fair market value of these obligations is based on quoted and
    actual prices paid for similar work. We also perform some of our
    final capping, closure and post-closure activities using
    internal resources. Where internal resources are expected to be
    used to fulfill an asset retirement obligation, we have added a



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

profit margin to the estimated cost of such services to better
    reflect their fair market value. If we perform these services
    internally, the added profit margin would be recognized as a
    component of operating income in the period the obligation is
    settled.

An estimate of fair value should include the price that
    marketplace participants are able to receive for bearing the
    uncertainties in cash flows. However, when utilizing discounted
    cash flow techniques, reliable estimates of market premiums may
    not be obtainable. In this situation, it is not necessary to
    consider a market risk premium in the determination of expected
    cash flows. While the cost of asset retirement obligations
    associated with final capping, closure and post-closure can be
    quantified and estimated, there is not an active market that can
    be utilized to determine the fair value of these activities. In
    the waste industry, there generally is not a market for selling
    the responsibility for final capping, closure and post-closure
    independent of selling the landfill in its entirety.
    Accordingly, we believe that it is not possible to develop a
    methodology to reliably estimate a market risk premium and have
    excluded a market risk premium from our determination of
    expected cash flow for landfill asset retirement obligations.

Our estimates of costs to discharge asset retirement obligations
    for landfills are developed in today’s dollars. These costs
    are inflated each year to reflect a normal escalation of prices
    up to the year they are expected to be paid. We use a 2.5%
    inflation rate, which is based on the ten-year historical moving
    average increase of the U.S. Consumer Price Index, and is
    the rate used by most waste industry participants.

These estimated costs are then discounted to their present value
    using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. In general, the
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate we used for liability
    recognition was 7.5% and 6.6% for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which was based
    on the estimated all-in yield we would have needed to offer to
    sell thirty-year debt in the public market. However, our
    capping, closure and post-closure obligations acquired from
    Allied were recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition
    date, and were discounted using a rate of 9.75% due to market
    conditions in effect at the time of the acquisition.

Changes in asset retirement obligations due to the passage of
    time are measured by recognizing accretion expense in a manner
    that results in a constant effective interest rate being applied
    to the average carrying amount of the liability. The effective
    interest rate used to calculate accretion expense is our
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect at the time the
    liabilities were recorded.

Changes due to revisions of the estimates of the amount or
    timing of the original undiscounted cash flows used to record a
    liability are recognized by increasing or decreasing the
    carrying amount of the asset retirement obligation liability and
    the carrying amount of the related asset. Upward revisions in
    the amount of undiscounted estimated cash flows used to record a
    liability are discounted using the credit-adjusted, risk-free
    rate in effect at the time of the change. Downward revisions in
    the amount of undiscounted estimated cash flows used to record a
    liability are discounted using the credit-adjusted, risk-free
    rate that existed when the original liability was recognized.

We review our calculations with respect to landfill asset
    retirement obligations at least annually. If there is a
    significant change in the facts and circumstances related to a
    landfill during the year, we will review our calculations for
    the landfill as soon as practical after the change has occurred.

Environmental
    Operating Costs

In the normal course of business, we expense currently as
    incurred various operating costs associated with environmental
    compliance. These costs include, among other things, leachate
    treatment and disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring
    and systems maintenance, interim cap maintenance, costs
    associated with the application of daily cover materials, and
    the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental
    compliance.

Environmental
    Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to
    the protection of the environment, and we remediate sites in the
    ordinary course of our business. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation
    at sites that we either own or operate, including sites that we
    have acquired, or sites where we have (or a company that we have
    acquired has) delivered waste. Our environmental remediation
    liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating
    groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as
    controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related
    legal costs. To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites,
    we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of
    contamination at each identified site, the required remediation
    methods, the apportionment of responsibility among the
    potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of
    those parties. We accrue for costs associated with environmental
    remediation obligations when such costs are probable and
    reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss
    contingencies. We periodically review the status of all
    environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood
    of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary. Changes
    in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized
    currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is
    known. Adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the
    near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts. We have
    not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from
    other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies.

The environmental liabilities assumed from Allied relate to
    impacts at both owned and unowned sites. In the case of owned
    sites, we are actively working with the appropriate regulatory
    entity under the applicable regulations (typically RCRA or
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
    Act of 1980 (CERCLA)) to characterize and remediate potential
    issues. At unowned sites, we are working within the regulatory
    and procedural framework established by CERCLA to characterize
    and remediate potential issues, in conjunction with other
    potentially liable parties at each location. Pursuant to the
    purchase method of accounting, we have recorded the
    environmental remediation liabilities assumed from Allied based
    upon estimates of their fair value, using an estimate of future
    cash flows or settlement. Previously, and consistent with our
    method of accounting, Allied recorded remediation liabilities
    based upon accounting for loss contingencies, however, amounts
    recorded under this method are generally not at fair value.

Since the date of acquisition, our process for deriving fair
    value for the environmental liabilities assumed from Allied
    included first identifying the population of remediation sites
    where we are either fully or partially responsible for
    remediation or potential remediation. The population of
    remediation sites was then stratified into categories based on
    (i) the maturity of the issue relative to recognized stages
    in the applicable regulation (typically CERCLA or RCRA) and
    (ii) the extent of our participation in the remediation
    activity. Using these categories, we applied one of the
    following multiple estimation processes to quantify fair value:

•

For sites with established responsibility but a high level of
    uncertainty with the outcome of the remedial process, we
    developed multiple remediation scenarios. We then probability
    weighted the remediation scenarios to develop a fair value
    estimate.

•

For sites where the level of responsibility was less defined, we
    developed a fair value estimate of the settlement costs based
    upon market participant assessments from external legal counsel.

•

For sites which we own and are in the earliest stages of the
    remedial process, we identified the most applicable standard
    remedial techniques and then probability weighted the use of
    each technique to develop a fair value estimate.

•

For the remaining sites with low levels of uncertainty, we
    developed a primary remedial strategy and cost estimate to
    determine the fair value of the liability.

The initial liabilities recorded as part of our acquisition of
    Allied were recorded using provisional amounts based upon
    information available at that time. During 2009, we gathered and
    assessed new information obtained about the facts and
    circumstances surrounding Allied’s remediation sites. In
    certain situations, we used external engineers and attorneys to
    assist in the development of our fair value estimates. As a
    result of



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

the process, we increased the fair value of our remediation
    reserves by $181.9 million. Any further adjustments to our
    remediation reserves resulting in changes in estimate or reserve
    settlements will be reflected currently in earnings in the
    periods in which such adjustments become known.

Asset
    Impairments

We continually evaluate whether events or changes in
    circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the
    estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets or whether the
    remaining balances of those assets should be evaluated for
    possible impairment. Long-lived assets include, for example,
    capitalized landfill costs, other property and equipment, and
    identifiable intangible assets. Events or changes in
    circumstances that may indicate that an asset may be impaired
    include the following:

•

A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset
    group,

•

A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition,

•

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
    climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group,
    including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator,

•

An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
    originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a
    long-lived asset,

•

A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a
    history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or
    forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the
    use of a long-lived asset or asset group,

•

A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived
    asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of
    significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
    life, or

•

An impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit.

There are certain indicators listed above that require
    significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry
    when applied to landfill development or expansion. For example,
    a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit
    application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted.
    In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one
    landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill
    airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary
    course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators
    of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry.

If indicators of impairment exist, the asset or asset group is
    reviewed to determine whether its recoverability is impaired. We
    assess the recoverability of the asset or asset group by
    comparing its carrying value to an estimate (or estimates) of
    its undiscounted future cash flows over its remaining life. If
    the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group, we
    measure an impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The loss is recorded
    in the consolidated statement of income in the current period.
    Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and
    our projections of future cash flows and remaining useful lives
    may vary materially from actual results.

Self-Insurance
    Reserves

Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. Accruals for
    self-insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates
    of claims incurred but not reported. We consider our past claims
    experience, including both frequency and settlement amount of
    claims, in determining these estimates. It is possible that
    recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future
    payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to estimates recorded
    resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in the
    consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such
    adjustments are known. In general, our self-insurance reserves
    are recorded on an undiscounted basis. However, our estimate of
    the self-insurance liabilities we acquired in the acquisition of



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

Allied have been recorded at fair value, and, therefore, have
    been discounted to present value based on our estimate of the
    timing of the related cash flows.

As we are the primary obligor for payment of all claims, we
    report our insurance claim liabilities on a gross basis in other
    current and long-term liabilities and any associated recoveries
    from our insurers are recorded in other assets.

Business
    Combinations

We acquire businesses in the waste industry, including
    non-hazardous waste collection, transfer and disposal
    operations, as part of our growth strategy. For all acquisitions
    completed prior to December 31, 2008 (prior to the
    effective date of the new business combinations pronouncement as
    discussed in

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

),
    businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements
    from the date of acquisition. The cost of the acquired
    businesses is allocated to the assets acquired and the
    liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair values thereof.
    These estimates are revised during the allocation period as
    necessary if, and when, information regarding contingencies
    becomes available to further define and quantify assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed. The allocation period generally does
    not exceed one year. To the extent contingencies such as
    pre-acquisition environmental matters, litigation and related
    legal fees are resolved or settled during the allocation period,
    such items are included in the revised allocation of the
    purchase price. After the allocation period, the effect of
    changes in such contingencies is included in results of
    operations in the periods in which the adjustments are
    determined.

For all acquisitions completed under the new business
    combinations pronouncement, as of the respective acquisition
    dates, we recognize, separately from goodwill, the identifiable
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated
    acquisition-date fair values. We measure and recognize goodwill
    as of the acquisition date as the excess of: (i) the
    aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred, the
    fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (if
    any) and the acquisition-date fair value of the our previously
    held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over
    (ii) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed. If information about facts and circumstances existing
    as of the acquisition date is incomplete by the end of the
    reporting period in which a business combination occurs, we will
    report provisional amounts for the items for which the
    accounting is incomplete. The measurement or allocation period
    ends once we receive the information we were seeking; however,
    this period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date.
    Any material adjustments recognized during the measurement
    period will be reflected retrospectively in the consolidated
    financial statements of the subsequent period. We will recognize
    third-party transaction related costs as expense currently in
    the period in which they are incurred.

Discontinued
    Operations

We analyze our operations that have been divested or classified
    as

held-for-sale

in order to determine if they qualify for discontinued
    operations accounting. Only operations that qualify as a
    component of an entity under U.S. GAAP can be included in
    discontinued operations. In addition, only components where we
    do not have significant continuing involvement with the divested
    operations would qualify for discontinued operations accounting.
    For our purposes, continuing involvement would include
    continuing to receive waste at our landfill or recycling
    facility from a divested hauling operation or transfer station
    or continuing to dispose of waste at a divested landfill or
    transfer station.

Costs
    Associated with Exit Activities

We record costs associated with exit activities such as for
    employee termination benefits that represent a one-time benefit
    when management approves and commits to a plan of termination,
    and communicates the termination arrangement to the employees,
    or over the future service period, if any. Other costs
    associated with



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

exit activities may include contract termination costs,
    including costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or
    subleased, and facility and employee relocation costs.

In addition, we account for costs to exit an activity of an
    acquired company and involuntary employee termination benefits
    associated with acquired businesses in the purchase price
    allocation of the acquired business if a plan to exit an
    activity of an acquired company exists, and those costs have no
    future economic benefit to us and will be incurred as a direct
    result of the exit plan, or the exit costs represent amounts to
    be incurred by us under a contractual obligation of the acquired
    entity that existed prior to the acquisition date. We recognize
    employee termination benefits as liabilities assumed as of the
    acquisition date when management approves and commits to a plan
    of termination, and communicates the termination arrangement to
    the employees, if the future service period for these employees
    is less than sixty days from their date of notification.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and
    regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to
    significant uncertainty. In general, we determine whether to
    disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment
    of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or
    probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated. We assess
    our potential liability relating to litigation and regulatory
    matters based on information available to us. Management’s
    assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible
    outcomes under various strategies. We accrue for loss
    contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably
    estimable. If a contingent liability is only reasonably
    possible, we will disclose the potential range of the loss, if
    estimable.

Contingent liabilities recorded in purchase accounting are
    recorded at their fair values. These fair values may be
    different from the values we would have otherwise recorded, had
    the contingent liability not been assumed as part of an
    acquisition of a business.

Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income

Accumulated other comprehensive income is a component of
    stockholders’ equity and includes the effective portion of
    the net changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges which
    consist of prices for diesel fuel and other commodities, net of
    tax, and certain adjustments to liabilities associated with our
    employee benefit plan liabilities, net of tax.

Revenue
    Recognition

We generally provide services under contracts with
    municipalities or individual customers. Municipal and commercial
    contracts are generally long-term and often have renewal
    options. Advance billings are recorded as deferred revenue, and
    revenue is recognized over the period services are provided. No
    one customer has individually accounted for more than 5% of our
    consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any
    of the past three years.

We recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are
    met:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists such as a service
    agreement with a municipality, a hauling customer or a disposal
    customer,

•

Services have been performed such as the collection and hauling
    of waste or the disposal of waste at a disposal facility owned
    or operated by us,

•

The price of the services provided to the customer is fixed or
    determinable, and

•

Collectibility is reasonably assured.

    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Income
    Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and Puerto
    Rico. We record deferred income taxes to reflect the effects of
    temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities and their tax bases using enacted tax rates that we
    expect to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or
    recovered.

We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these
    assets will more likely than not be realized. In making these
    determinations, we consider all available positive and negative
    evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax
    liabilities, tax planning strategies, projected future taxable
    income and recent financial operating results. In the event we
    determine that we would be able to realize a deferred income tax
    asset in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, we
    would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would
    reduce the provision for income taxes.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted new guidance which
    clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized in the financial statements. This new guidance
    provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may
    be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position
    will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any
    related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical
    merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not
    recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.
    This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement,
    de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
    positions in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and
    penalties are included in other accrued liabilities, and
    deferred income taxes and other long-term tax liabilities, in
    the consolidated balance sheets.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plan

We currently have one qualified defined pension plan, the BFI
    Retirement Plan (the Plan). The Plan covers certain current and
    former employees of Allied in the United States, including some
    employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. The
    Plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of
    compensation as defined in the Plan document. However, the
    benefits of approximately 97% of the current plan participants
    were frozen upon Allied’s acquisition of BFI in 1999.

Our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding
    standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security
    Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as
    amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Plan’s
    assets have been invested as determined by our Retirement
    Benefits Committee. We annually review and adjust the
    Plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary.

The benefit obligation and associated income or expense related
    to the Plan are determined using annually established
    assumptions for discount rates, expected rates of return and
    average rates for compensation increases. We determine the
    discount rate based on a model that matches the timing and
    amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high
    quality bonds priced as of the pension plan measurement date.
    When that timing does not correspond to a published high-quality
    bond rate, our model uses an expected yield curve to determine
    an appropriate current discount rate. The yields on the bonds
    are used to derive a discount rate for the liability. In
    developing our expected rate of return assumption, we evaluate
    long-term expected and historical actual returns on the plan
    assets, giving consideration to our asset mix and the
    anticipated duration of our plan obligations. The average rate
    of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average
    pay increases over the periods benefits are earned. Our
    assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed
    necessary.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

Equity-Based
    Compensation Plans

We recognize equity-based compensation expense on the estimated
    fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments
    issued as compensation to employees over the requisite service
    periods.

Cash flows resulting from tax benefits related to tax deductions
    in excess of those recorded for compensation expense, resulting
    from the exercise of stock options, are classified as cash flows
    from financing activities. All other tax benefits related to
    stock options have been presented as a component of cash flows
    from operating activities.

We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over
    the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion
    of the award, or to the employee’s retirement-eligible
    date, if earlier.

The fair value of each option on the date of grant is estimated
    using a lattice binomial option-pricing model based on certain
    valuation assumptions. Expected volatilities are based on our
    historical stock prices over the contractual terms of the
    options and other factors. The risk-free interest rates are
    based on the published U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
    at the time of the grant for instruments with a similar life.
    The dividend yield reflects our dividend yield at the date of
    grant. The expected life represents the period that the stock
    options are expected to be outstanding, taking into
    consideration the contractual terms of the options and our
    employees’ historical exercise and post-vesting employment
    termination behavior, weighted to reflect the job level
    demographic profile of the employees receiving the option
    grants. The estimated forfeiture rate used to record
    compensation expense is based on historical forfeitures and is
    adjusted periodically based on actual results.

Leases

We lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of our
    business. Our most significant lease obligations are for
    property and equipment specific to our industry, including real
    property operated as a landfill or transfer station and
    operating equipment. Our leases have varying terms. Some may
    include renewal or purchase options, escalation clauses,
    restrictions, penalties or other obligations that we consider in
    determining minimum lease payments. The leases are classified as
    either operating leases or capital leases, as appropriate.

Operating
    Leases

Many of our leases are operating leases. This classification
    generally can be attributed to either (i) relatively low
    fixed minimum lease payments (including, for example, real
    property lease payments that are not fixed and vary based on the
    volume of waste we receive or process), or (ii) minimum
    lease terms that are much shorter than the assets’ economic
    useful lives. Management expects that, in the normal course of
    business, our operating leases will be renewed, replaced by
    other leases, or replaced with fixed asset expenditures.

Capital
    Leases

Assets acquired under capital leases are capitalized at the
    inception of each lease and are amortized to depreciation
    expense over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the
    lease term on either a straight-line or a

units-of-consumption

basis, depending on the asset leased. The present value of the
    related lease payments is recorded as a debt obligation.

Related
    Party Transactions

It is our policy that transactions with related parties must be
    on terms that, on the whole, are no less favorable than those
    that would be available from unaffiliated parties.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Convertible
    Debt Instruments

In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued new accounting guidance for convertible debt instruments
    that, by their stated terms, may be settled in cash (or other
    assets) upon conversion, including partial cash settlement of
    the conversion option. The guidance requires bifurcation of the
    instrument into a debt component that is initially recorded at
    fair value and an equity component. The difference between the
    fair value of the debt component and the initial proceeds from
    issuance of the instrument is recorded as a component of equity.
    The liability component of the debt instrument is accreted to
    par using the effective yield method; accretion is reported as a
    component of interest expense. The equity component is not
    subsequently re-valued as long as it continues to qualify for
    equity treatment. We adopted this guidance on January 1,
    2009, and adoption did not have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance for business
    combinations applicable to all transactions and other events in
    which one entity obtains control over one or more other
    businesses. Under this new guidance all transaction and
    restructuring charges are required to be recognized as expenses
    as incurred. The new guidance requires the fair value of the
    purchase consideration, including the issuance of equity
    securities, to be determined as of the acquisition date. It also
    requires the acquirer to recognize assets acquired, liabilities
    assumed, consideration paid and any noncontrolling interests
    acquired at their acquisition-date fair values. Changes in
    deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities for tax
    uncertainties subsequent to the acquisition date that do not
    meet certain remeasurement criteria are recorded in the income
    statement. The impact of the adoption of this new guidance on
    our consolidated financial statements is dependent on the nature
    and volume of future acquisitions, and, therefore, can not be
    determined at this time.

This new guidance is required to be applied prospectively, and,
    in general, will be effective for businesses we acquire on or
    after January 1, 2009. However, in the case of deferred tax
    asset valuation allowances and uncertain tax position
    liabilities, the guidance applies to the accounting for all
    business acquisitions, whether the acquisition occurred before
    or after adoption.

Determination
    of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

In April 2008, the FASB directed the FASB Staff to issue an
    amendment to the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used for purposes of
    determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset
    under previously existing guidance. The amendment is intended to
    improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized
    intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to
    measure the fair value of the asset under GAAP. We adopted the
    amendment on January 1, 2009 and adoption of this amendment
    did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued new guidance that defines
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
    accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. The new guidance was effective for us on
    January 1, 2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB issued
    an amendment to this new guidance which delayed the effective
    date for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities,
    except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value
    in the financial statements on a recurring basis, for one year.
    We adopted the guidance with respect to financial assets and
    liabilities beginning January 1, 2008 and with respect to
    our non-financial assets and liabilities effective
    January 1, 2009 pursuant



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

to the requirements of the amendment. The impact of adopting
    this guidance and related amendment did not have a material
    effect on our consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

Noncontrolling
    Interests

In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance requiring
    noncontrolling interests or minority interests to be treated as
    a separate component of equity, not as a liability or other item
    outside of permanent equity. Upon a loss of control, the
    interests sold, as well as any interest retained, are required
    to be measured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized
    in earnings. Additionally, when control is obtained and a
    previous equity interest was held, a gain or loss will be
    recognized in earnings for the difference between the fair value
    of the previously held equity interest and its carrying value.
    Based on the new guidance, assets and liabilities will not
    change for subsequent purchase or sale transactions with
    noncontrolling interests as long as control is maintained.
    Differences between the fair value of consideration paid or
    received and the carrying value of noncontrolling interests are
    to be recognized as an adjustment to the parent interest’s
    equity. We adopted this new guidance on January 1, 2009,
    and the implementation did not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Determining
    Whether an Instrument is Indexed to an Entity’s Own
    Stock

In June 2008, the FASB issued guidance for determining whether
    an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an
    entity’s own stock when evaluating the instrument as a
    derivative. An instrument that is both indexed to an
    entity’s own stock and classified in stockholder’s
    equity in the entity’s statement of financial position is
    not considered a derivative. This new guidance provides a
    two-step process to determine whether an equity-linked
    instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock
    first by evaluating the instrument’s contingent exercise
    provisions, if any, and second, by evaluating the
    instrument’s settlement provisions. We adopted this new
    guidance on January 1, 2009 and the adoption did not have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

Consolidation
    of Variable Interest Entities

In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and
    disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable
    interest entities (VIEs) and requires an enterprise to perform
    an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable
    interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest
    in a VIE. Under this new guidance, an enterprise has a
    controlling financial interest when it has (i) the power to
    direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact
    the entity’s economic performance and (ii) the
    obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to
    receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
    significant to the VIE. An enterprise is required to assess
    whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure
    that a VIE operates as designed when determining whether it has
    power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. It
    also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is
    the primary beneficiary of a VIE, requires enhanced disclosures
    and eliminates the scope exclusion for qualifying
    special-purpose entities. This new guidance is effect for annual
    reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009. We do
    not believe the impact of adopting this guidance will have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

Merger
    with Allied Waste Industries, Inc.

Rationale
    for the Merger

We believe that our merger with Allied results in a combined
    company that has greater financial strength, operational
    efficiencies, earning power and growth potential than either we
    or Allied would have on our own. We believe that there is a
    substantial strategic fit between the markets serviced by
    Republic, which are located predominantly in high-growth Sunbelt
    markets, and those served by Allied, which has a national
    footprint. Since our collection markets are highly
    complementary, the combined company is diversified across
    geographic markets, customer segments and service offerings.
    This balance will allow our combined company to capitalize on
    attractive business opportunities, mitigate geographic risk, and
    results in greater stability and predictability of revenue and
    free cash flow. We also believe that the merger will result in a
    number of important synergies, primarily from achieving greater
    operating efficiencies, capturing inherent economies of scale
    and leveraging corporate resources. Therefore, we believe that
    the premium we paid to effectuate the merger was reasonable.

Purchase
    Price

The purchase price paid for Allied, which was acquired on
    December 5, 2008, includes the value of Republic’s
    common stock issued in exchange for Allied’s outstanding
    common stock, the conversion of Allied’s outstanding stock
    options and unvested restricted stock awards into
    Republic’s equity-based awards, cash paid to retire
    Allied’s revolving credit facility, the fair value of
    Allied’s debt less cash assumed at closing and
    Republic’s transaction costs.

NOTES TO

The intangible assets identified that were determined to have
    value as a result of our analysis of Allied’s projected
    revenue streams and their related profits include customer
    relationships, franchise agreements, other municipal agreements,
    non-compete agreements and trade names. The fair values for
    these intangible assets are reflected in the previous table.
    Other intangible assets were identified that are considered to
    be components of either property and equipment or goodwill under
    U.S. GAAP, including the value of the permitted and probable
    airspace at Allied’s landfills (property and equipment),
    the going concern element of Allied’s business (goodwill)
    and its assembled workforce (goodwill). The going concern
    element represents the ability of an established business to
    earn a higher rate of return on an assembled collection of net
    assets than would be expected if those assets had to be acquired
    separately. A substantial portion of this going concern element
    acquired is represented by Allied’s infrastructure of
    market-based collection routes and its related integrated waste
    transfer and disposal channels, whose value has been included in
    goodwill.

All of the goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from
    the acquisition of Allied will not be deductible for income tax
    purposes.

Pro
    Forma Information

The consolidated financial statements presented for Republic
    include the operating results of Allied from the date of the

    occurred had the acquisition been consummated at the beginning
    of the periods presented or of future results of the combined
    operations. Furthermore, the pro forma results do not give
    effect to all cost savings or incremental costs that occur as a
    result of the integration and consolidation of the acquisition

Assets
    Held For Sale

As a condition of the merger with Allied, the Department of
    Justice (DOJ) required us to divest of certain assets and
    related liabilities. As such, we classified these assets and
    liabilities as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance
    sheet at December 31, 2008. Certain of the legacy Republic
    assets classified as held for sale were adjusted to their
    estimated fair values less costs to sell and resulted in the
    recognition of an asset impairment loss of $1.8 million and
    $6.1 million in our consolidated statements of income for
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    The assets held for sale related to operations that were
    Allied’s were recorded at their estimated fair values in
    our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 in

Restructuring
    Charges

As a result of our acquisition of Allied, we committed to a
    restructuring plan related to our corporate overhead and other
    administrative and operating functions. The plan included
    closing our corporate office in Florida, consolidating
    administrative functions to Arizona, the former headquarters of
    Allied, and reducing staffing levels. The plan also included
    closing and consolidating certain operating locations and
    terminating certain leases. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we incurred $63.2 million of
    restructuring and integration charges related to our integration
    of Allied, of which $34.0 million consists of charges for
    severance and other employee termination and relocation
    benefits. The remainder of the charges primarily related to
    consulting and professional fees. Substantially, all the charges
    are recorded in our corporate segment. During 2010, we expect to
    incur additional charges approximating $12 million to
    complete our plan. We expect that the majority of these charges
    will be paid during 2010 and will extend into 2011.

The following table reflects the activity during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 associated with the liabilities (included
    in other accrued liabilities) incurred in connection with the

    as a

result increased the legal reserves by $53.9 million. Any
    further adjustments to our Allied legal matter reserves
    resulting from changes in estimates or reserve settlements will
    be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the
    periods in which such adjustments become known. As of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recorded $85.4 million
    and $31.5 million, respectively, of accrued liabilities in
    purchase accounting for the estimated liabilities related to
    various Allied legal matters.

During 2009, we recorded additional liabilities for unfavorable
    contract and lease exit costs of $22.6 million and
    $7.7 million, respectively. The underlying lease agreements
    and contracts have remaining non-cancellable terms ranging from
    1 to 21 years. The following table reflects activity during

Self-Insurance
    Reserves

In general, our self-insurance reserves are recorded on an
    undiscounted basis. However, our estimate of the self-insurance
    liabilities we assumed in the acquisition of Allied have been
    recorded at fair value, and, therefore, have been discounted to
    present value using a rate of 9.75%. Discounted reserves are
    accreted to interest expense through the period that they are
    paid.

Our liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims
    at December 31, 2009 (which includes claims for
    workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability
    and employee health care benefits) were $412.9 million
    under our current risk management program and are included in
    other accrued liabilities and self-insurance reserves, net of
    current portion in our consolidated balance sheets. While the
    ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future
    developments, we believe, recorded reserves are adequate to
    cover the future payment of claims. However, it is possible that
    recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future
    payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to estimates recorded
    resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in our
    consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such
    adjustments are known. The following table summarizes the
    activity in our self-insurance reserves for the years ended

LANDFILL
    AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

As of December 31, 2009, we owned or operated 192 active
    solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity of
    approximately 4.6 billion in-place cubic yards.
    Additionally, we currently have post-closure responsibility for
    132 closed landfills.

The initial liabilities recorded as part of our acquisition of
    Allied were developed using provisional amounts based upon
    information available at that time. During 2009, we gathered and
    assessed new information about the facts and circumstances
    surrounding our sites, and, as a result, increased the fair
    value of our closure and post-closure reserves by
    $72.3 million. The amounts we have recorded for these
    obligations are not comparable to the amounts Allied recorded.
    We have recorded these obligations at their estimated fair
    values, inflated them to the expected payment date and then
    discounted the obligations using our credit-adjusted, risk-free
    rate at the time of the acquisition of 9.75%. Any further
    adjustments to our final capping, closure and post-closure
    liabilities will be reflected prospectively in our consolidated
    statement of income in the periods in which such adjustments
    become known.

We review our landfill asset retirement obligations annually. As
    a result, we recorded a net decrease in amortization expense of
    $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and
    a net increase in amortization expense of $0.6 million and
    $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively, primarily related to changes in estimates
    and assumptions concerning the cost and timing of future final
    capping, closure and post-closure activities.

The fair value of assets that are legally restricted for
    purposes of settling final capping, closure and post-closure
    obligations was approximately $58.5 million at
    December 31, 2009 and is included in restricted cash in our
    consolidated balance sheet.

The following is a discussion of our significant remediation
    matters:

Countywide Landfill.

In 2007, we were issued Final
    Findings and Orders (F&Os) by the Ohio Environmental
    Protection Agency (OEPA) related to environmental conditions at
    our Countywide Recycling and Disposal Facility (Countywide) in
    East Sparta, Ohio and we agreed with the OEPA to undertake
    certain other remedial actions as well. During 2008, Republic
    Services of Ohio II, LLC (Republic-Ohio), an Ohio limited
    liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of ours and parent
    of Countywide, entered into an Agreed Order on Consent (AOC)
    with the EPA requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred by
    the EPA and requiring Republic-Ohio to perform certain
    remediation activities at Countywide. Republic-Ohio also has
    completed construction of an isolation break under the authority
    and supervision of the EPA. On September 30, 2009,
    Republic-Ohio entered into a set of F&Os with the OEPA that
    supersede previous F&Os mentioned above. The F&Os
    require the implementation of a comprehensive operation and
    maintenance program for managing the remediation area. The
    operation and maintenance program requires Republic-Ohio to
    maintain the temporary cap and other engineering controls to
    prevent odors and isolate and contain the reaction. The
    operation and maintenance program is ultimately designed to
    result in the final capping and closure of the

88-acre

remediation area at Countywide. The remediation liability for
    Countywide recorded as of December 31, 2009 is
    $74.2 million, of which approximately $5.7 million is
    expected to be paid during 2010.

West Contra Costa County Landfill.

In 2006, we were
    issued an Enforcement Order by the California Department of
    Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) for the Class 1 Hazardous
    waste cell at the West Contra Costa County Landfill (West
    County). Subsequently, we entered into a Consent Agreement with
    DTSC in 2007 at which time we agreed to undertake certain
    remedial actions. The remediation liability for West County
    recorded as of December 31, 2009 is $46.8 million, of
    which approximately $1.6 million is expected to be paid
    during 2010.

Sunrise Landfill.

On August 1, 2008, Republic
    Services of Southern Nevada (RSSN), our wholly owned subsidiary,
    signed a Consent Decree with the EPA, the Bureau of Land
    Management and Clark County, Nevada related to the Sunrise
    Landfill. Under the Consent Decree, RSSN has agreed to perform
    certain remedial actions at the Sunrise Landfill for which RSSN
    and Clark County were otherwise jointly and severally liable. We
    also paid $1.0 million in sanctions related to the Consent
    Decree. RSSN is currently working with the Clark County Staff
    and Board of Commissioners to develop a mechanism to fund the
    costs to comply with the Consent Decree. However, we have not
    recorded any potential recoveries. The remediation liability for
    Sunrise recorded as of December 31, 2009 is
    $37.0 million, of which approximately $12.8 million is
    expected to be paid during 2010.

Congress Development Landfill.

In January 2006,
    Congress Development Co. (CDC) was issued an Agreed
    Preliminary Injunction and Order by the Circuit Court of
    Illinois, Cook County. Subsequently, the court issued two
    additional Supplemental Orders that required CDC to implement
    certain remedial actions at the Congress Landfill. The
    remediation liability recorded for CDC as of December 31,
    2009 is $82.5 million, of which approximately
    $19.9 million is expected to be paid during 2010.

It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the
    charges noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional
    information, to the extent that such information impacts the
    costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future
    changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the

Impact of
    Allied Merger on Supplemental Indentures for Certain
    Debt

On December 10, 2008, we received the requisite consents to
    amend the supplemental indentures governing certain outstanding
    debt securities of Allied Waste North America, Inc. (AWNA). The
    amendment to each supplemental indenture modified the ongoing
    reporting obligations required of Allied. Under the amended
    supplemental indentures, the ongoing reporting obligations may
    be satisfied by Republic.

The collateral that had secured the AWNA senior notes and the
    BFI Debentures (as defined below) equally and ratably with the
    Allied bank credit facility was released upon the completion of
    our merger with Allied and the repayment of that facility.

Credit
    Facilities

In April 2007, we increased our unsecured revolving credit
    facility from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion and
    extended the term from 2010 to 2012. In conjunction with the
    merger with Allied, in September 2008, we entered into an
    additional $1.75 billion revolving credit facility with a
    group of banks. This credit facility was used initially at the
    time of the merger to refinance extensions of credit under
    Allied’s senior credit facility, to pay fees and expenses
    in connection therewith, and to pay fees and expenses incurred
    in connection with the merger. We also amended our existing
    $1.0 billion credit facility to conform certain terms of
    the facility to be consistent with the new $1.75 billion
    credit facility. We did not change the maturity date of the
    $1.0 billion credit facility.

The $1.0 billion revolving credit facility due April 2012
    and the $1.75 billion revolving credit facility due
    September 2013 (collectively, Credit Facilities) bear interest
    at a Base Rate, or a Eurodollar Rate, both terms defined in the
    agreements, plus an applicable margin based on our Debt Ratings,
    also a term defined in the agreements. As of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, the interest rate for our borrowings under our
    Credit Facilities was 1.82% and 3.43%, respectively. Our Credit
    Facilities are also subject to facility fees based on applicable
    rates defined in the agreements and the aggregate commitments,
    regardless of usage. Borrowings under our Credit Facilities can
    be used for working capital, capital expenditures, letters of
    credit and other general corporate purposes. The agreements
    governing our Credit Facilities require us to maintain certain
    financial and other covenants. We have the ability to pay
    dividends and to repurchase common stock provided that we are in
    compliance with these covenants. We had $0.3 billion and
    $0.6 billion of Eurodollar Rate borrowings, and
    $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion of letters of credit
    utilizing availability under our Credit Facilities, leaving
    $0.8 billion and $0.4 billion of availability under
    our Credit Facilities at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance
    with the covenants under our Credit Facilities.

Receivables
    Secured Loans

We have an accounts receivable securitization program with two
    financial institutions that allows us to borrow up to
    $300.0 million on a revolving basis under loan agreements
    secured by receivables. As of December 31, 2009,
    receivables secured loans totaled $300.0 million. In May
    2009, we renewed the facility for 364 days and reduced the
    borrowing capacity from $400.0 million to
    $300.0 million. We expect to repay the facility from free
    cash flow, draws on our Credit Facilities or proceeds from other
    note offerings on or before the May 2010 maturity.

The receivables securitizing this facility are held in and owned
    by a wholly owned and fully consolidated subsidiary. This
    subsidiary is a separate corporate entity whose assets, or
    collateral securing the borrowings, are available first to
    satisfy the claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. At
    December 31, 2009, the total amount of accounts receivable
    (gross) serving as collateral securing the borrowing was
    $442.4 million. This facility is accounted for as a secured
    borrowing with a pledge of collateral. The receivables and debt
    obligation remain on our consolidated balance sheet. At
    December 31, 2009, we had outstanding borrowings under this
    program of $300.0 million. The borrowings under this
    program bear interest at the financial institutions’
    commercial

paper rate plus an applicable spread and interest is payable
    monthly. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008 the interest rate
    for our borrowings under this facility was 1.57% and 2.95%,
    respectively.

Senior
    Notes and Debentures

In December 2009 we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings
    under our Credit Facilities to redeem $400.0 million of our
    7.375% Senior Notes due 2014. The Senior Notes were
    redeemed at a price equal to 103.688% of the principal amount of
    the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We incurred a loss
    of $46.0 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt,
    charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees
    paid to effectuate the repurchase.

In November 2009, we issued $600.0 million of senior notes
    with a fixed interest rate of 5.250% due 2021 in a private
    placement transaction. The notes are general senior unsecured
    obligations and mature on November 15, 2021. Interest is
    payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15, beginning
    May 15, 2010. These senior notes are guaranteed by each of
    our subsidiaries that also guarantee our Credit Facilities.
    These guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of the
    subsidiary guarantors. In addition, we entered into Registration
    Rights Agreements with the initial purchasers of the notes.
    Under the Registration Rights Agreements, we agreed to use our
    reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a
    registration statement to exchange the notes for freely tradable
    notes issued by us. If we are unable to effect the exchange
    offer within 365 days, we agreed to pay additional interest
    on the notes. We used the net proceeds from the notes, cash on
    hand or incremental borrowings under our Credit Facilities as
    follows: (i) to redeem $450.0 million of our
    7.875% Senior Notes due 2013 at 102.625%, and (ii) to
    redeem $230.0 million of our 4.250% Senior Convertible
    Debentures due 2034 at par. We incurred a loss of
    $51.9 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt, charges
    for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees paid to
    effectuate the repurchase.

In September 2009, we issued $650.0 million of
    5.500% senior notes due 2019 with an unamortized discount
    of $4.5 million at December 31, 2009. The notes are
    general senior unsecured obligations and mature on
    September 15, 2019. Interest is payable semi-annually on
    March 15 and September 15, beginning March 15, 2010.
    The notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also
    guarantee our Credit Facilities. These guarantees are general
    senior unsecured obligations of subsidiary guarantors. In
    addition, in September 2009, we entered into a Registration
    Rights Agreement with the representatives of the initial
    purchasers of the notes. Under the Registration Rights
    Agreement, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to cause
    to become effective a registration statement to exchange the
    notes for freely tradable notes issued by us. If we are unable
    to effect the exchange offer within 365 days, we agreed to
    pay additional interest on the notes. We used the net proceeds
    from the notes, cash on hand or incremental borrowings under our
    Credit Facilities as follows: (i) to tender for
    $325.5 million of certain outstanding senior notes maturing
    in 2010 and 2011 that were issued by us or one of our
    subsidiaries; (ii) approximately $250 million to
    reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility, and
    (iii) approximately $105 million to remit estimated
    tax payments related to our divestiture of assets in connection
    with our merger with Allied. We incurred a loss of
    $31.8 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt, charges
    for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees paid to
    effectuate the repurchase.

During 2009 we repurchased a portion of our senior notes
    maturing in 2010 and 2011 in the secondary market. As a result,
    we incurred additional losses on extinguishment of debt of
    $4.4 million related to premiums paid to repurchase debt,
    charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees
    paid to effectuate the repurchase. Also during 2009, we
    completed the required divestitures under the consent decree
    with the DOJ. Proceeds from the sales of the divested assets
    were primarily used to reduce amounts outstanding under our
    Credit Facilities. Additionally, our senior unsecured notes
    bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.125% matured during 2009.
    We repaid the remaining principal balance of $99.3 million
    in May 2009.

Tax-Exempt
    Financings

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had
    $1,223.7 million and $1,308.2 million, respectively,
    of fixed and variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding
    with maturities ranging from 2010 to 2037. During 2008, we
    assumed $527.0 million of tax-exempt bonds and other
    tax-exempt financings as part of our acquisition of Allied. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the total of the unamortized
    adjustment to fair value recorded in purchase accounting for the
    assumed tax-exempt financings was $49.0 million and
    $52.9 million, respectively, which is being amortized to
    interest expense over the remaining terms of the debt.

Approximately two-thirds of our tax-exempt financings are
    remarketed weekly or daily by a remarketing agent to effectively
    maintain a variable yield. These variable rate tax-exempt
    financings are credit enhanced with letters of credit having
    terms in excess of one year issued by banks with credit ratings
    of AA or better. The holders of the bonds can put them back to
    the remarketing agent at the end of each interest period. To
    date, the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our
    variable rate unsecured tax-exempt bonds.

As of December 31, 2009, we had $236.6 million of
    restricted cash, of which $93.1 million represented
    proceeds from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds and other
    tax-exempt financings and will be used to fund capital
    expenditures under the terms of the agreements. Restricted cash
    also includes amounts held in trust as a financial guarantee of
    our performance.

Other
    Debt

Other debt primarily includes capital lease liabilities of
    $91.9 million and $139.5 million as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, with maturities
    ranging from 2010 to 2042.

    which is a

liquidity facility maturing in May 2010 and has a balance of
    $300.0 million at December 31, 2009. We expect to
    repay the facility on or before the May 2010 maturity.

Fair
    Value of Debt

The fair value of our fixed rate senior notes using quoted
    market rates is $5.7 billion and $5.2 billion at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The carrying
    value of these fixed rate unsecured notes is $5.0 billion
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008. The carrying amounts of our
    remaining notes payable and tax-exempt financing approximate
    fair value because interest rates are variable and, accordingly,
    approximate current market rates for instruments with similar
    risk and maturities. The fair value of our debt is determined as
    of the balance sheet date and is subject to change.

Guarantees

Substantially all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our
    obligations under the Credit Facilities.

Substantially all of our subsidiaries guarantee each series of
    senior notes issued by our parent company, Republic Services,
    Inc. Our parent company and substantially all of our
    subsidiaries guarantee each series of senior notes issued by our
    subsidiary Allied Waste North America, Inc. (AWNA notes) and
    each series of senior notes issued by our subsidiary
    Browning-Ferris Industries, LLC (successor to Browning-Ferris
    Industries, Inc.) (BFI notes). All of these guarantees would be
    automatically released upon the release of our subsidiaries from
    their guarantee obligations under the Credit Facilities, except
    the guarantee of Allied in the case of the AWNA notes, and the
    guarantees of Allied and Allied Waste North America, Inc. in the
    case of the BFI notes.

We have guaranteed some of the tax-exempt bonds of our
    subsidiaries. If a subsidiary fails to meet its obligations
    associated with tax-exempt bonds as they come due, we will be
    required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No
    additional liability has been recorded for these guarantees
    because the underlying obligations are reflected in our
    consolidated balance sheets.

Interest
    Rate Swap Agreements

Our ability to obtain financing through the capital markets is a
    key component of our financial strategy. Historically, we have
    managed risk associated with executing this strategy,
    particularly as it relates to fluctuations in interest rates, by
    using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. We also
    entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage risk
    associated with fluctuations in interest rates. The swap
    agreements have a total notional value of $210.0 million
    and mature in August 2011. This maturity is identical to our
    unsecured notes that also mature in 2011. Under the swap
    agreements, we pay interest at floating rates based on changes
    in LIBOR and receive interest at fixed rates of 6.75%. We have
    designated these agreements as hedges of changes in the fair
    value of our fixed-rate debt. We have determined that these
    agreements qualify for the short-cut method and, therefore,
    changes in the fair value of the agreements are assumed to be
    perfectly effective in hedging changes in the fair value of our
    fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, interest rate swap
    agreements are reflected at their fair value of
    $9.9 million and $15.1 million, respectively, and are
    included in other assets and as an adjustment to long-term debt
    in our consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded net interest
    income of $8.7 million and $3.8 million and net
    interest expense of $2.3 million, respectively, related to
    our interest rate swap agreements, which is included in interest
    expense in our consolidated statements of income.

The following table summarizes the impact of changes in the fair
    value of our derivatives and the underlying hedged items on our

From time to time, we enter into treasury locks and other
    instruments for the purpose of managing exposure to fluctuations
    in interest rates in anticipation of future debt issuances. In
    September 2009, we entered into treasury lock agreements having
    an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million to hedge
    interest rates on 10 year U.S. Treasury Notes in
    connection with the issuance of our $650.0 million
    5.500% Senior Notes. Upon issuance of the notes we
    terminated the treasury locks and paid approximately
    $2.5 million to the counterparties. This amount, net of
    tax, was recorded as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income and is being amortized as an increase to
    interest expense over the life of the issued debt. This
    transaction was recorded as a cash flow hedge. As of
    December 31, 2009, there were no treasury lock cash flow
    hedges outstanding.

We have state net operating loss carryforwards, with an
    estimated tax effect of $135.3 million, available at
    December 31, 2009. These state net operating loss
    carryforwards expire at various times between 2010 and 2023. We
    believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from
    certain state net operating loss carryforwards will not be
    realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a
    valuation allowance of $122.9 million on deferred tax
    assets relating to these state net operating loss carryforwards.
    In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
    management considers whether it is more likely than not that
    some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized after the initial recognition of the deferred tax
    asset. We provide valuation allowances, as needed, to offset
    portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding
    the future realization of such deferred tax assets. We adjust
    the valuation allowance in the period management determines it
    is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will
    not be realized.

We have recorded $98.2 million of deferred tax assets and
    $637.2 million of deferred income taxes and other long-term
    tax liabilities as part of our purchase price allocation for our
    acquisition of Allied.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a tax
    charge of $13.5 million related to non-deductible goodwill
    expensed as a result of various divestitures. During the year
    ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a tax charge of
    $12.3 million related to non-deductible compensation
    payouts as a result of the merger with Allied. During the year
    ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a net tax benefit of
    $4.8 million in our provision for income taxes related to
    the resolution of various tax matters, including the effective
    completion of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits of our
    consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004.

We made income tax payments (net of refunds received) of
    approximately $444 million, $128 million and
    $152 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2008, approximately

    uncertain tax liabilities were recognized through goodwill.
    Under this new guidance, subsequent changes in acquired
    unrecognized tax liabilities are recognized through the income
    tax provision. As of December 31, 2009, $211.9 million
    of the $242.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits related
    to tax positions taken by Allied prior to the merger.

Included in the balance at December 31, 2009 are
    approximately $217.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits
    (net of the federal benefit on state issues) that, if
    recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate in future
    periods.

During 2009, we settled our outstanding tax dispute related to
    Allied’s risk management companies (see —

Risk
    Management Companies

) with both the DOJ and the IRS. This
    settlement reduced our gross unrecognized tax benefits by
    approximately $299.6 million. During 2009, we also settled
    with the IRS, through an accounting method change, our
    outstanding tax dispute related to intercompany insurance
    premiums paid to Allied’s captive insurance company. This
    settlement reduced our gross unrecognized tax benefits by
    approximately $62.6 million. In addition to these federal
    matters, we also resolved various state matters that, in the
    aggregate, reduced our gross unrecognized tax benefits during
    2009 by approximately $5.8 million.

We recognize interest and penalties as incurred within the
    provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of
    income. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits previously
    noted, we accrued interest of $24.5 million during 2009
    and, in total as of December 31, 2009, have recognized a
    liability for penalties of $1.5 million and interest of
    $92.3 million. During 2008, we accrued penalties of
    $0.2 million and interest of $5.2 million and, in
    total at December 31, 2008, had recognized a liability for
    penalties of $88.1 million and interest of
    $180.0 million. During 2007, we accrued interest of
    $0.9 million and, in total at December 31, 2007, had
    recognized a liability for penalties and interest of
    $5.5 million.

The decrease in accrued interest and penalties between 2009 and
    2008 was driven mainly by the settlements discussed previously.
    However, the current year interest expense increased due to the
    accrual of a full twelve months of interest expense on
    Allied’s acquired uncertain tax positions versus only one
    month of accrued interest expense recorded in 2008.

Gross unrecognized tax benefits that we expect to settle in the
    following twelve months are in the range of $10.0 million
    to $20.0 million. It is reasonably possible that the amount
    of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease in the
    next twelve months.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

We and our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the
    U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as income tax in multiple
    state jurisdictions. We have acquired Allied’s open tax
    periods as part of the acquisition. Allied is currently under
    examination or administrative review by various state and
    federal taxing authorities for certain tax years, including
    federal income tax audits for calendar years 2000 through 2007.

Prior to the merger, the IRS had commenced an examination of our
    2005 through 2007 tax years and this exam is currently ongoing.
    In 2009, the IRS opened an examination of our 2008 tax year. We
    are also under state examination in various jurisdictions for
    various tax years. These audits are ongoing.

We are subject to numerous federal, foreign, state and local tax
    rules and regulations. Our compliance with such rules and
    regulations is periodically audited by tax authorities. These
    authorities may challenge the positions taken in our tax
    filings. As such, to provide for certain potential tax
    exposures, we maintain liabilities for uncertain tax positions
    for our estimate of the final outcome of the examinations.

We believe that the liabilities for uncertain tax positions
    recorded are adequate. However, a significant assessment against
    us in excess of the liabilities recorded could have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

Risk
    Management Companies

Prior to Allied’s acquisition of Browning Ferris Industries
    (BFI) in July 1999, certain BFI operating companies, as part of
    a risk management initiative to manage and reduce costs
    associated with certain liabilities, contributed assets and
    existing environmental and self-insurance liabilities to six
    fully consolidated BFI risk management companies (RMCs) in
    exchange for stock representing a minority ownership interest in
    the RMCs. Subsequently, the BFI operating companies sold that
    stock in the RMCs to third parties at fair market value which
    resulted in a capital loss of approximately $902 million
    for tax purposes, calculated as the excess of the tax basis of
    the stock over the cash proceeds received.

On January 18, 2001, the IRS designated this type of
    transaction and other similar transactions as a
    “potentially abusive tax shelter” under IRS
    regulations. During 2002, the IRS proposed the disallowance of
    all of this capital loss. In April 2005, the Appeals Office of
    the IRS upheld the disallowance of the capital loss deduction
    with respect to BFI tax years prior to the acquisition. In July
    2005, Allied filed a suit for refund in the United States Court
    of Federal Claims (CFC) relating to the BFI tax years. In
    January 2009, we paid all tax, interest and penalty asserted by
    the IRS with respect to the BFI tax years and withdrew our suit
    for refund in the CFC.

In August 2008, Allied received from the IRS a Statutory Notice
    of Deficiency related to its utilization of BFI’s capital
    loss carryforward on Allied’s 1999 tax return. In October
    2008, Allied filed a suit for refund in federal district court
    in Arizona with respect to Allied’s 1999 tax year. In
    December 2009, we reached a settlement with both the DOJ and IRS
    for Allied’s 1999 tax year and all subsequent tax years.
    Under the settlement, the company resolved all remaining
    liability for this matter (including federal and state tax,
    penalty and interest) for approximately $125 million. We
    paid approximately $58 million in the first quarter of 2010
    and expect to pay the remainder, approximately $67 million,
    later in 2010. While the final settlement amount is less than
    the amount previously accrued for this matter, the accrual and
    the adjustment thereto are reflected in our allocation of
    purchase price associated with the acquisition of Allied and had
    no impact on our consolidated statement of income.

Exchange
    of Partnership Interests

In April 2002, Allied exchanged minority partnership interests
    in four

waste-to-energy

facilities for majority partnership interests in equipment
    purchasing businesses, which are now wholly owned subsidiaries.
    In November 2008, the IRS issued a formal disallowance to Allied
    contending that the exchange was instead a sale on which a
    corresponding gain should have been recognized. We believe our
    position is supported by

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

relevant technical authorities and strong business purpose and
    we intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter.
    Although we intend to vigorously defend our position on this
    matter, if the exchange is treated as a sale, we estimate it
    could have a potential federal and state cash tax impact of
    approximately $156 million plus accrued interest through
    December 31, 2009 of approximately $59 million. In
    addition, the IRS has asserted a penalty of 20% of the
    additional income tax due. The potential tax and interest (but
    not penalty or penalty-related interest) of a full adjustment
    for this matter have been fully reserved in our consolidated
    balance sheet at December 31, 2009. The successful
    assertion by the IRS of penalty and penalty-related interest in
    connection with this matter could have a material adverse impact
    on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

Methane
    Gas

As part of its examination of Allied’s 2000 through 2006
    federal income tax returns, the IRS reviewed Allied’s
    treatment of costs associated with its landfill operations. As a
    result of this review, the IRS has proposed that certain
    landfill costs be allocated to the collection and control of
    methane gas that is naturally produced within the landfill. The
    IRS’ position is that the methane gas produced by a
    landfill is a joint product resulting from operation of the
    landfill and, therefore, these costs should not be expensed
    until the methane gas is sold or otherwise disposed.

We have protested this matter to the Appeals Office of the IRS.
    We believe we have several meritorious defenses, including the
    fact that methane gas is not actively produced for sale by us
    but rather arises naturally in the context of providing disposal
    services. Therefore, we believe that the subsequent resolution
    of this issue will not have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

Stock-Based
    Compensation

In July 1998, we adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (1998
    Plan) to provide for grants of options to purchase shares of
    common stock, restricted stock and other equity-based
    compensation to our employees and non-employee directors who are
    eligible to participate in the 1998 Plan. The 1998 Plan expired
    on June 30, 2008. In February 2007, our Board of Directors
    approved the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (2007 Plan) to replace
    the 1998 Plan when it expired. The 2007 Plan was approved by our
    stockholders in May 2007. We believe that such awards better
    align the interests of our employees with those of our
    stockholders. There were 6.8 million shares reserved for
    future grants under the 2007 Plan as of December 31, 2009.

Options granted under the 1998 Plan and the 2007 Plan are
    non-qualified and are granted at a price equal to the fair
    market value of our common stock at the date of grant.
    Generally, options granted have a term of seven to ten years
    from the date of grant, and vest in increments of 25% per year
    over a four year period beginning on the first anniversary date
    of the grant. Options granted to non-employee directors have a
    term of ten years and are fully vested at the grant date.

In December 2008, the Board of Directors adopted the Republic
    Services, Inc. 2006 Incentive Stock Plan (formerly known as the
    Allied Waste Industries, Inc. 2006 Incentive Stock Plan (the
    2006 Plan)) as amended and restated effective December 5,
    2008. Allied’s stockholders approved the 2006 Plan in May
    2006. The 2006 Plan was amended and restated effective
    December 5, 2008 to reflect that Republic Services, Inc. is
    the new sponsor of the Plan, that any references to shares of
    common stock is to shares of common stock of Republic Services,
    Inc., and to adjust outstanding awards and the number of shares
    available under the Plan to reflect the merger. The 2006 Plan,
    as amended and restated, provides for the grant of non-qualified
    stock options, incentive stock options, shares of restricted
    stock, shares of phantom stock, stock bonuses, restricted stock
    units, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, dividend
    equivalents, cash awards, or other stock-based

awards. Awards granted under the 2006 Plan prior to
    December 5, 2008 became fully vested and nonforfeitable
    upon the closing of the merger. Awards may be granted under the
    2006 Plan, as amended and restated, after December 5, 2008
    only to employees and consultants of Allied Waste Industries,
    Inc. and its subsidiaries who were not employed by Republic
    Services, Inc. prior to such date. At December 31, 2009,
    there were approximately 15.3 million shares of common
    stock reserved for future grants under the 2006 Plan.

Stock
    Options

We use a lattice binomial option-pricing model to value our
    stock option grants. We recognize compensation expense on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each
    separately vesting portion of the award, or to the
    employee’s retirement eligible date, if earlier. Expected
    volatility is based on the weighted average of the most recent
    one-year volatility and a historical rolling average volatility
    of our stock over the expected life of the option. The risk-free
    interest rate is based on Federal Reserve rates in effect for
    bonds with maturity dates equal to the expected term of the
    option. We use historical data to estimate future option
    exercises, forfeitures and expected life of the options. When
    appropriate, separate groups of employees that have similar
    historical exercise behavior are considered separately for
    valuation purposes. The weighted-average estimated fair values
    of stock options granted during the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $3.79, $4.36 and
    $6.49 per option, respectively, which were calculated using the
    following weighted-average assumptions:

    and as grants of replacement options for Allied’s
    outstanding stock options as of the effective date of the
    merger, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. In
    December 2008, we replaced Allied’s outstanding, vested and
    unvested stock options with Republic stock options with similar
    terms and conditions, and recorded a credit to
    additional-paid-in-capital of $61.2 million as part of the
    purchase price paid for the acquisition.

Additionally, as of the effective date of the merger with
    Allied, all of Republic’s unvested stock options
    outstanding were vested in accordance with the change in control
    provisions of the 1998 and 2007 Plans. We recorded compensation
    expense of $6.5 million in December 2008 to recognize the
    immediate vesting of the stock options.

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    compensation expense for stock options was $7.8 million,
    $14.0 million and $6.3 million, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2009 we awarded 320,354
    deferred stock units and during each of the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, we awarded 36,000 deferred
    stock units to our non-employee directors under our 1998 Plan.
    These stock units vest immediately, but the directors receive
    the underlying shares only after their board service ends or a
    change in control occurs, as defined by the 1998 Plan. The stock
    units do not carry any voting or dividend rights, except the
    right to receive additional stock units in lieu of dividends.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we awarded
    195,611 shares of restricted stock to executives and other
    officers and directors, of which 110,669 of the shares vest
    effective May 14, 2010 and 38,670 of the shares awarded
    vest effective January 31, 2012. Additionally,
    26,914 shares awarded vest in four equal annual
    installments beginning on the anniversary date of the original
    grant. The remaining 15,904 shares awarded vested during
    2009 and 3,454 shares will vest February 19, 2010.
    During the vesting period, the participants have voting rights
    and receive dividends declared and paid on the shares, but the
    shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise
    encumbered. Additionally, granted but unvested shares are
    forfeited in the event the participant resigns employment with
    us for other than good reason.

During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we
    awarded 426,670 and 185,820 shares of restricted stock to
    our executive officers, of which 236,170 granted during 2008

Incentive Plan. As of the effective date of the acquisition of
    Allied, all of Republic’s remaining unvested restricted
    stock outstanding was vested in accordance with the change in
    control provisions of the 1998 Plan.

The fair value of stock units and restricted shares is based on
    the closing market price on the date of grant. The compensation
    expense related to these stock units and restricted shares is
    amortized ratably over the vesting period, or the accelerated
    vesting period if certain performance targets are achieved.

As of the effective date of the merger with Allied, all of
    Republic’s outstanding and unvested restricted stock was
    vested in accordance with the change in control provisions of
    the 1998 and 2007 Plans. We recorded compensation expense of
    $5.3 million in December 2008 to recognize the immediate
    vesting of the restricted stock. In addition, the deferred stock
    units were vested and a cash payment was made totaling
    $4.0 million based on the fair value of the deferred stock
    units as of the date of vesting.

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    compensation expense related to stock units and restricted
    shares totaled $7.2 million, $10.0 million and
    $4.6 million, respectively.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plan

We currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan,
    the BFI Retirement Plan (the Plan). The Plan covers certain
    employees in the United States, including some employees subject
    to collective bargaining agreements.

The Plan benefits are frozen. Interest credits continue to be
    earned by participants in the Plan, and participants whose
    collective bargaining agreements provide for additional benefit
    accruals under the Plan continue to receive those credits in
    accordance with the terms of their bargaining agreements. The
    Plan was converted from a traditional defined benefit plan to a
    cash balance plan in 1993.

During 2002, the Plan and the Pension Plan of San Mateo
    County Scavenger Company and Affiliated Divisions of
    Browning-Ferris Industries of California, Inc. (San Mateo
    Pension Plan) were merged into one plan. However, benefits
    continue to be determined under two separate benefit structures.

Prior to the conversion of the cash balance design, benefits
    payable as a single life annuity under the Plan were based on
    the participant’s highest five years of earnings out of the
    last ten years of service. Upon conversion to the cash balance
    plan, the existing accrued benefits were converted to a lump-sum
    value using the actuarial assumptions in effect at the time.
    Participants’ cash balance accounts are increased until
    retirement by certain benefit and interest credits under the
    terms of their bargaining agreements. Participants may elect
    early retirement with the attainment of age 55 and
    completion of 10 years of credited service at reduced
    benefits. Participants with 35 years of service may retire
    at age 62 without any reduction in benefits.

The San Mateo Pension Plan covers certain employees at the
    San Mateo location excluding employees who are covered
    under collective bargaining agreements under which benefits had
    been the subject of good faith bargaining unless the collective
    bargaining agreement otherwise provides for such coverage.
    Benefits are based on the participant’s highest five years
    of average earnings out of the last fifteen years of service.
    Effective January 1, 2004, participants who have attained
    the age of 55 and completed 30 years of credited service
    may elect early retirement without any reduction in benefits.
    Effective January 1, 2006, the San Mateo Pension Plan
    was amended to modify the definition of eligible employees to
    exclude highly compensated employees. In addition, no new
    employees hired or rehired after December 31, 2005 are
    eligible to participate in or accrue a benefit under the
    San Mateo Pension Plan.

BFI Post
    Retirement Healthcare Plan

The BFI Post Retirement Healthcare Plan provides continued
    medical coverage for certain current and former employees
    following their retirement, including some employees subject to
    collective bargaining agreements. Eligibility for this plan is
    limited to certain employees who had ten or more years of
    service and were age 55

or older as of December 31, 1998, and certain employees in
    California who were hired on or before December 31, 2005
    and who retire on or after age 55 with at least thirty
    years of service.

Multi-Employer
    Pension Plans

We contribute to 25 multi-employer pension plans under
    collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented
    employees. Approximately 17% of our total current employees are
    participants in such multi-employer plans. These plans generally
    provide retirement benefits to participants based on their
    service to contributing employers. We do not administer these
    multi-employer plans. In general, these plans are managed by a
    board of trustees with the unions appointing certain trustees
    and other contributing employers of the plan appointing certain
    members. We generally are not represented on the board of
    trustees.

Based on the information available to us, we believe that some
    of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute are either
    “critical” or “endangered” as those terms
    are defined in the Pension Protection Act enacted in 2006 (the
    PPA). The PPA requires underfunded pension plans to improve
    their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the
    level of their underfunding. Until the plan trustees develop the
    funding improvement plans or rehabilitation plans as required by
    the PPA, we are unable to determine the amount of assessments we
    may be subject to, if any. Accordingly, we cannot determine at
    this time the impact that the PPA may have on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Furthermore, under current law regarding multi-employer benefit
    plans, a plan’s termination, our voluntary withdrawal
    (which we consider from time to time), or the mass withdrawal of
    all contributing employers from any under-funded, multi-employer
    pension plan would require us to make payments to the plan for
    our proportionate share of the multi-employer plan’s
    unfunded vested liabilities. It is possible that there may be a
    mass withdrawal of employers contributing to these plans or
    plans may terminate in the near future. We could have
    adjustments to our estimates for these matters in the near term
    that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our pension expense for multi-employer plans was
    $43.0 million, $21.8 million and $18.9 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plan

Our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) provides
    retirement benefits to certain of Allied’s employees and
    former employees. SERP participants whose employment with us has
    been severed as a result of the merger received cash settlements
    six months following their respective separation dates. Benefits
    for SERP participants who remain with Republic were frozen as of
    the effective date of the merger. However, these active
    participants will continue to accrue interest credits at the
    annual rate of 6.0% until they are eligible for retirement. SERP
    participants who retired prior to the acquisition will continue
    to receive their benefits in accordance with the original plan
    provisions which allow for a maximum of ten years of retirement
    benefits equal to 60% of each participant’s respective
    average base salary during the three consecutive full calendar
    years of employment immediately preceding their date of
    retirement. At December 31, 2009, there were one retired
    and two active participants in the plan. As the SERP is frozen,
    no assumptions are made about future compensation levels, and as
    such, there is no difference between the projected benefit and
    the accumulated benefit obligation.

We also assumed post-retirement medical obligations associated
    with the SERP totaling $1.8 million as of the acquisition
    date. Medical liabilities were $1.4 million and
    $2.0 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and are
    included in the post retirement healthcare amounts in the table
    below.

We are required to separately recognize the overfunded or
    underfunded status of our pension and other post retirement
    employee benefit plans as an asset or liability. The funded
    status represents the difference between the projected benefit
    obligation (PBO) and the fair value of the plan assets. The PBO
    is the present value of



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the
    effect of assumed future salary increases, if any. The PBO is
    equal to the accumulated benefit obligation as the present value
    of these liabilities is not affected by assumed future salary
    increases. We use a measurement date that coincides with our
    year end of December 31.

The following table presents the accumulated benefit obligation
    and reconciliations of the changes in the projected benefit
    obligations, the plan assets and the accounting funded status of
    our defined benefit pension plan, SERP and post retirement
    healthcare plans for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008.

We determine the discount rate used in the measurement of our
    obligations based on a model which matches the timing and amount
    of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds
    priced as of the pension plan measurement date. Where that
    timing does not correspond to a published high-quality bond
    rate, our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an
    appropriate current discount rate. The yields on the bonds are
    used to derive a discount rate for the liability. The term of
    our obligation, based on the expected retirement dates of our
    workforce, is approximately ten years.

In developing our expected rate of return assumption, we have
    evaluated the actual historical performance and long-term return
    projections of the Plan assets, which give consideration to the
    asset mix and the anticipated timing of the pension plan
    outflows. We employ a total return investment approach whereby a
    mix of equity and fixed income investments are used to maximize
    the long-term return of plan assets for what we consider a
    prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to
    minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over
    the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful
    consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and our
    financial condition. The investment portfolio contains a
    diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
    Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and

non-U.S. stocks

as well as growth, value, and small and large capitalizations.
    Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient
    and timely manner. However, derivatives may not be used to
    leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying
    investments. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an
    ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic
    asset and liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio
    reviews.

A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost
    trend rate would not have a material impact on the service and
    interest costs and would increase our postretirement benefit
    obligation by $0.1 million at December 31, 2009. A one
    percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend
    rate would decrease the service and interest costs by less than
    $0.1 million and would decrease our postretirement benefit
    obligation by $0.1 million at December 31, 2009.

Our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding
    standards established by Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the PPA. We
    have not made contributions to the defined benefit pension plan
    in 2009, 2008 or 2007 and we are not required to make any
    contributions in 2010.

The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to maintain a
    broadly diversified portfolio designed to achieve our target of
    an average long-term rate of return of 7.25%. While we believe
    we can achieve a

long-term

average return of 7.25%, we cannot be certain that the portfolio
    will perform to our expectations. Assets are strategically
    allocated among debt and equity portfolios in order to achieve a
    diversification level that dampens fluctuations in investment
    returns. Asset allocation target ranges and strategies are
    reviewed periodically with the assistance of an independent
    external consulting firm.

The pension assets are valued at fair value. The following is a
    description of the valuation methodologies used for the
    investments measured at fair value, including the general
    classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation
    hierarchy.

•

Money market accounts are valued at the net asset value of
    shares held by the Plan at year end. These investments are
    classified as Level 2 investments.

•

Registered Investment Companies are mutual funds and other
    commingled funds registered with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission. Mutual funds are traded actively on public
    exchanges. The share prices for mutual funds are published at
    the close of each business day. Holdings of mutual

funds are classified as Level 1 investments. Other
    registered commingled funds are not publicly traded, but
    underlying assets (stocks and bonds) held in these funds are
    traded on active markets and the prices for these assets are
    readily observable. Holdings in other registered commingled
    funds are classified as Level 2 investments.

•

Limited partnerships invest in privately-held companies or
    privately held real estate assets. Due to the private nature of
    the partnership investments, pricing inputs are not readily
    observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general
    partners that manage the partnerships. These valuations are
    based on property appraisals, application of public market
    multiples to private company cash flows, utilization of market
    transactions that provide valuation information for comparable
    companies and other methods. Holdings of limited partnership
    interests are classified as Level 3 investments.

Defined
    Contribution Plans

We maintain the Republic Services 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan),
    which is a defined contribution plan covering all eligible
    employees. Under the provisions of the Plan, participants may
    direct us to defer a portion of their compensation to the Plan,
    subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations. We provide for an
    employer matching contribution equal to 100% of the first 3% of
    eligible compensation and 50% of the next 2% of eligible
    compensation contributed by each employee, which is funded in
    cash. All contributions vest immediately.

In conjunction with the merger with Allied, we acquired the
    Allied 401(k) Plan. Participants in the Allied 401(k) Plan are
    eligible for the same employer matching contribution as those
    under the 401(k) Plan effective January 1, 2009. Effective
    July 1, 2009, the 401(k) Plan and the Allied 401(k) Plan
    were merged to form the Republic Services, Inc. 401(k) Plan.



REPUBLIC

NOTES TO

Total expense recorded for matching 401(k) contributions in
    2009, 2008 and 2007 was $30.5 million, $16.8 million
    and $10.9 million, respectively.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

Employees of Republic are eligible to participate in an employee
    stock purchase plan. The plan allows participants to purchase
    the Company’s common stock for 95% of its quoted market
    price on the last day of each calendar quarter. For the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, issuances under
    this plan totaled 49,918 shares, 84,918 shares and
    66,078 shares, respectively. At December 31, 2009,
    shares reserved for issuance to employees under this plan
    totaled 699,609 and Republic held employee contributions of
    approximately $0.7 million for the purchase of common
    stock. Compensation expense for plan participants in 2009, 2008
    and 2007 was not material.

Incentive
    Compensation Plans

Our compensation program includes a management incentive plan,
    which uses certain performance metrics such as free cash flow,
    targeted earnings and return on invested capital to measure
    performance. In addition, in connection with our merger with
    Allied, our Board of Directors has approved a synergy incentive
    plan that provides compensation that depends on our achieving
    targeted synergies of approximately $150 million by the end
    of 2010. Incentive awards are payable in cash.

12.

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

From 2000 through 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $2.6 billion of our common stock. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had paid $2.3 billion to
    repurchase 82.6 million shares of our common stock, of
    which 4.6 million shares were acquired during the year
    ended December 31, 2008 for $138.4 million. During the
    second quarter of 2008, we suspended our share repurchase
    program as a result of the pending merger with Allied.

In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a

3-for-2

stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effective on
    March 16, 2007, to stockholders of record as of
    March 5, 2007. We distributed 64.5 million shares from
    treasury stock to effect the stock split. In connection
    therewith, we transferred $1.6 billion from treasury stock
    to additional paid-in capital and $0.2 billion from
    treasury stock to retained earnings, representing in total the
    weighted-average cost of the treasury shares distributed.

We initiated a quarterly cash dividend in July 2003. The
    dividend has been increased each year thereafter, with the
    latest increase occurring in the third quarter of 2008. Our
    current quarterly dividend per share is $0.19. Dividends
    declared were $288.7 million, $168.9 million and
    $104.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, we
    recorded a quarterly dividend payable of approximately
    $72.4 million to stockholders of record at the close of
    business on January 4, 2010.

EARNINGS
    PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares (including
    restricted stock and vested but unissued deferred stock units)
    outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is
    based on the combined weighted average number of common shares
    and common share equivalents outstanding which include, where
    appropriate, the assumed exercise of employee stock options and
    unvested restricted stock awards. In computing diluted earnings
    per share, we utilize the treasury stock method.

    the market value of such services.

Depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion includes a
    net decrease in amortization expense of $5.1 million
    recorded during 2009, and net increases of $0.6 million and
    $3.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to
    changes in estimates and assumptions concerning the cost and
    timing of future final capping, closure and post-closure
    activities.

The following items are included in the above segment
    information:

•

Eastern Region.

For the year ended December 31,
    2009, operating income includes a $4.0 million net gain
    from the disposition of assets and $12.0 million of
    insurance proceeds related to the remediation costs at our
    Countywide facility. For the year ended December 31, 2008,
    operating loss includes a $99.9 million charge for
    environmental conditions and a $75.9 million impairment
    charge at our Countywide facility.

•

Midwest Region.

For the year ended December 31,
    2009, operating income includes a $27.1 million net gain
    from the disposition of assets.

Western Region.

For the year ended December 31,
    2009, operating income includes an $88.1 million net gain
    from the disposition of assets and a charge of $5.2 million
    related to environmental conditions at our West County facility.
    For the year ended December 31, 2008, operating income
    includes a charge of $55.9 million, including
    $34.0 million associated with conditions at the Sunrise
    landfill and $21.9 million at our West County facility. For
    the year ended December 31, 2007, operating income includes
    a $9.6 million charge associated with an increase in
    estimated leachate treatment and disposal costs at our West
    County facility.

Corporate Entities.

Corporate functions include
    legal, tax, treasury, information technology, risk management,
    human resources, corporate accounts and other typical
    administrative functions. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we incurred $8.2 million of
    transaction related expenses from the disposition of assets in
    other segments and a $3.7 million charge for the asset
    impairment associated with our former corporate office in
    Florida. Capital expenditures for corporate entities primarily
    include vehicle inventory acquired but not yet assigned to
    operating locations and facilities.

Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from sales of
    recycled materials and revenue from national accounts acquired
    from Allied. National accounts revenue included in other revenue
    represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide
    contracts in markets outside our operating areas, and, as such,
    the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to
    local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue
    is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in
    cost of operations.

Fuel
    Hedges

We have entered into multiple swap agreements designated as cash
    flow hedges to mitigate some of our exposure related to changes
    in diesel fuel prices. The swaps qualified for, and were
    designated as, effective hedges of changes in the prices of
    forecasted diesel fuel purchases (fuel hedges).

If the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon
    of diesel fuel (average price) as published by the Department of
    Energy exceeds the contract price per gallon, we receive the
    difference between the average price and the contract price
    (multiplied by the notional gallons) from the counter-party. If
    the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of
    diesel fuel is less than the contract price per gallon, we pay
    the difference to the counter-party.

The fair values of our fuel hedges are obtained from third-party
    counter-parties and are determined using standard option
    valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being
    based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in
    the fair value hierarchy). The aggregated fair values of the
    outstanding fuel hedges at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were
    current assets of $3.2 million and $1.2 million,
    respectively, and current liabilities of $4.9 million and
    $12.9 million, respectively, and have been recorded in
    other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our
    consolidated balance sheets, respectively.

The effective portions of the changes in fair values as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, net of tax, of
    $1.0 million and $7.1 million, respectively, have been
    recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portions
    of the changes in fair values as of December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007 were immaterial and have been recorded in other income
    (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income.
    Realized (losses) gains of $(7.3) million,
    $5.9 million and $(1.6) million related to these fuel
    hedges are included in cost of operations in our consolidated

Recycling
    Commodity Hedges

Our revenue from sales of recycling commodities is primarily
    from sales of old corrugated cardboard (OCC) and old newspaper
    (ONP). We have entered into multiple swap agreements related to
    certain forecasted recycling commodity sales designated as cash
    flow hedges to mitigate some of our exposure related to changes
    in commodity prices. The swaps qualified for, and were

If the price per short ton of the hedging instrument (average
    price) as reported on the Official Board Market is less than the
    contract price per short ton, we receive the difference between
    the average price and the contract price (multiplied by the
    notional short tons) from the counter-party. If the price of the
    commodity exceeds the contract price per short ton, we pay the
    difference to the counter-party.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

We are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations
    and have implemented our own safeguards to respond to regulatory
    requirements. In the normal course of conducting our operations,
    we may become involved in certain legal and administrative
    proceedings. Some of these actions may result in fines,
    penalties or judgments against us, which may impact earnings and
    cash flows for a particular period. We accrue for legal matters
    and regulatory compliance contingencies when such costs are
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. Although the ultimate
    outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty,
    except as described below or in Note 10

, Income
    Taxes

, in the discussion of our outstanding tax dispute with
    the IRS, we do not believe that the outcome of our pending legal
    and administrative proceedings will have a material adverse
    impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Litigation,
    Environmental and Other Administrative Matters

The following is a discussion of certain proceedings against us.
    Although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be
    predicted with certainty, except as otherwise described below,
    we do not believe that the outcome of our pending litigation,
    environmental and other administrative proceedings will have a
    material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Countywide
    Matters

On March 26, 2007, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
    (OEPA) issued Final Findings and Orders (F&Os) to Republic
    Services of Ohio II, LLC (Republic-Ohio), an Ohio limited
    liability company and our wholly owned subsidiary. The F&Os
    related to environmental conditions attributed to a chemical
    reaction resulting from the disposal of certain aluminum
    production waste at the Countywide Recycling and Disposal
    facility (Countywide) in East Sparta, Ohio. The F&Os, and
    certain other remedial actions Republic-Ohio agreed with the
    OEPA to undertake to address the environmental conditions,
    included, without limitation, the following actions:
    (a) prohibiting leachate recirculation, (b) refraining
    from the disposal of solid waste in



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

certain portions of the site, (c) updating engineering
    plans and specifications and providing further information
    regarding the integrity of various engineered components at the
    site, (d) performing additional data collection,
    (e) taking additional measures to address emissions,
    (f) expanding the gas collection and control system,
    (g) installing an isolation break, (h) removing
    liquids from gas extraction wells, and (i) submitting a
    plan to the OEPA to suppress the chemical reaction and,
    following approval by the OEPA, implementing such plan.
    Republic-Ohio has performed certain interim remedial actions
    required by the OEPA. Republic-Ohio subsequently received
    additional orders from the OEPA requiring certain actions to be
    taken by Republic-Ohio, in addition to or in lieu of
    requirements contained in prior orders, including additional air
    quality monitoring and the installation and continued
    maintenance of gas well dewatering systems.

On September 30, 2009, Republic-Ohio entered into two
    legally binding agreements with the State of Ohio designed to
    further refine the activities necessary to resolve alleged
    compliance and licensing issues at the Countywide facility.

The first agreement is a Consent Order that resolves ongoing
    allegations of noncompliance at the facility and reflects
    agreements regarding the status of facility licensing. The
    allegations of noncompliance were summarized in a complaint that
    was filed by the Ohio Attorney General in the Stark County Court
    of Common Pleas and resolved the same day in accordance with
    terms of an agreed upon Consent Order entered into between
    Republic-Ohio and the State of Ohio. The Consent Order with Ohio
    requires Republic-Ohio to pay civil penalties and financial
    relief of $10.0 million, submit updated permit documents,
    and assess, evaluate, and determine the appropriate time to
    address certain compliance issues at the facility. All civil
    penalties and financial relief required by the Consent Order
    have been satisfied. Compliance with the terms of the Consent
    Order and other applicable rules will result in Countywide being
    considered to be in substantial compliance or on a legally
    enforceable schedule to return to compliance for annual
    licensing purposes.

The second agreement is a set of F&Os that were agreed to
    and entered into with the Ohio EPA. The F&Os require the
    implementation of a comprehensive operation and maintenance
    program that contains specific requirements for managing the
    remediation area. The operation and maintenance program is
    ultimately designed to result in the final capping and closure
    of the

88-acre

remediation area at Countywide. The September 30, 2009
    F&Os supersede all previous F&Os (discussed above)
    that were issued to Republic-Ohio regarding the reaction in the
    remediation area of the landfill. The operation and maintenance
    program requires Countywide to, among other things, maintain the
    temporary cap and other engineering controls designed to prevent
    odors and isolate and contain the reaction. The operation and
    maintenance program also contains provisions that require the
    installation of a composite cap in the remediation area when
    conditions become conducive to such installation.

Republic-Ohio has also entered into an Agreed Order on Consent
    (AOC) with the EPA requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred
    by the EPA and requiring Republic-Ohio to (a) design and
    install a temperature and gas monitoring system, (b) design
    and install a composite cap or cover, and (c) develop and
    implement an air monitoring program. The AOC became effective on
    April 17, 2008 and Republic-Ohio has complied with the
    terms of the AOC. Republic-Ohio also has completed construction
    of an isolation break under the authority and supervision of the
    EPA and reimbursed the EPA for certain costs associated with the
    EPA’s involvement in overseeing implementation of the AOC.
    On November 20, 2009, the EPA issued a Notification of
    Completion and Determination of Compliance to Countywide
    memorializing Countywide’s completion of the work required
    under the AOC.

The Commissioner of the Stark County Health Department
    (Commissioner) previously recommended that the Stark County
    Board of Health (Board of Health) suspend Countywide’s 2007
    annual operating license. The Commissioner also intended to
    recommend that the Board of Health deny Countywide’s
    license application for 2008. Republic-Ohio obtained a
    preliminary injunction on November 28, 2007 prohibiting the
    Board of Health from suspending its 2007 operating license.
    Republic-Ohio also obtained a preliminary injunction on
    February 15, 2008 prohibiting the Board of Health from
    denying its 2008 operating license application. The



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

litigation with the Board of Health has been concluded pursuant
    to a Consent Order entered into between Republic-Ohio and the
    Board of Health in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas. The
    Consent Order requires the Board of Health to issue conditional

and/or

final
    operating licenses to Countywide and requires Republic-Ohio to
    reimburse the Board of Health for certain expenses not to exceed
    $300,000 incurred related to monitoring and investigation of
    complaints regarding Countywide. Countywide’s 2009
    operating license has been challenged by Tuscarawas County, and
    the Board of Health issued Countywide its 2010 operating license
    on December 30, 2009, which also has been challenged by a
    local citizens’ group, Club 3000.

We believe that we have performed or are diligently performing
    all actions required under the F&Os, the AOC, and any
    applicable Consent Orders and that Countywide does not pose a
    threat to the environment. Additionally, we believe that we
    satisfy the rules and regulations that govern the operating
    license at Countywide.

In a suit filed on October 8, 2008 in the Tuscarawas County
    Ohio Court of Common Pleas, approximately 700 plaintiffs have
    named Republic Services, Inc. and Republic-Ohio as defendants.
    The claims alleged are negligence and nuisance and arise from
    the operation of Countywide. Republic-Ohio has owned and
    operated Countywide since February 1, 1999. Waste
    Management, Inc. and Waste Management Ohio, Inc., previous
    owners and operators of Countywide, have been named as
    defendants as well. Plaintiffs are individuals and businesses
    located in the geographic area around Countywide. They claim
    that due to the acceptance of a specific waste stream and
    operational issues and conditions, the landfill has generated
    odors and other unsafe emissions which have allegedly impaired
    the use and value of their property. There are also allegations
    that the emissions from the landfill may have adverse health
    effects. A second almost identical lawsuit was filed on
    October 13, 2009 in the Tuscarawas County Ohio Court of
    Common Pleas with approximately 82 plaintiffs. These plaintiffs
    named Republic Services, Inc., Republic-Ohio, Waste Management,
    Inc., and Waste Management Ohio, Inc. as defendants. The relief
    requested on behalf of each plaintiff in both actions is:
    (1) an award of compensatory damages according to proof in
    an amount in excess of $25,000 for each of the three counts of
    the amended complaint; (2) an award of punitive damages in
    the amount of two times compensatory damages, pursuant to
    applicable statute, or in such amount as may be awarded at trial
    for each of the three counts of the amended complaint,
    (3) costs for medical screening and monitoring of each
    plaintiff; (4) interest on the damages according to law;
    (5) costs and disbursements of the lawsuit;
    (6) reasonable fees for attorneys and expert witnesses; and
    (7) any other and further relief as the court deems just,
    proper and equitable. We anticipate that the two cases will be
    consolidated. Answers have been filed in both cases and
    discovery is ongoing. 164 plaintiffs in the first case and 41
    plaintiffs in the second case have been dismissed or are in the
    process of being dismissed for failing to comply with discovery.
    We intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs’
    allegations in both actions.

Luri
    Matter

On August 17, 2007, a lawsuit was filed by a former
    employee, Ronald Luri v. Republic Services, Inc., Republic
    Services of Ohio Hauling LLC, Republic Services of Ohio I LLC,
    Jim Bowen and Ron Krall in the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas
    Court in Ohio. On July 3, 2008, a jury verdict was awarded
    against us in the amount of $46.6 million, including
    $43.1 million in punitive damages. On September 24,
    2008, the Court awarded pre-judgment interest of
    $0.3 million and attorney fees and litigation costs of
    $1.1 million. Post-judgment interest accrued at a rate of
    8% for 2008 and 5% for 2009, and is accruing at a rate of 4% for
    2010. Management anticipates that post-judgment interest could
    accrue through the middle of 2011 for a total of
    $7.7 million. Post-judgment motions filed on our behalf and
    certain of our subsidiaries were denied, and on October 1,
    2008, we filed a notice of appeal. The parties submitted their
    appeal briefs and oral argument was scheduled for
    October 27, 2009. On October 23, 2009, the Court of
    Appeals dismissed the appeal holding that the trial court had
    not entered a final, appealable order. The case has been
    returned to the trial court for additional proceedings which may
    include entry of additional order(s) by the trial court followed
    by another appeal. It is reasonably possible that following all
    appeals a final judgment of liability for compensatory and

punitive damages may be assessed against us related to this
    matter. Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate
    outcome, management believes that the amount of any final,
    non-appealable judgment will not be material.

Forward
    Matters

The District Attorney for San Joaquin County filed a civil
    action against Forward, Inc. and Allied Waste Industries, Inc.
    on February 14, 2008 in the Superior Court of California,
    County of San Joaquin. Forward and Allied each filed
    answers in November 2008, denying all material allegations of
    the complaint. The complaint seeks civil penalties of $2,500 for
    each alleged violation, but no less than $10.0 million, and
    an injunction against Forward and Allied for alleged permit and
    regulatory violations at the Forward Landfill. The District
    Attorney contends that the alleged violations constitute unfair
    business practices under the California Business and Professions
    Code section 17200, et seq., by virtue of violations of
    Public Resources Code Division 30, Part 4,
    Chapter 3, Article 1, sections 44004 and
    44014(b); California Code of Regulations Title 27,
    Chapter 3, Subchapter 4, Article 6,
    sections 20690(11) and 20919.5; and Health and Safety Code
    sections 25200, 25100, et seq., and 25500, et seq. Although
    the complaint is worded very broadly and does not identify
    specific permit or regulatory violations, the District Attorney
    has articulated three primary concerns in past communications,
    alleging that the landfill: (1) used green waste containing
    food as alternative daily cover, (2) exceeded its daily
    solid waste tonnage receipt limitations under its solid waste
    facility permit, and (3) received hazardous waste in
    violation of its permit (i.e., auto shredder waste).
    Additionally, it is alleged that the landfill allowed a
    concentration of methane gas in excess of five percent.
    Discovery is currently underway. We are vigorously defending
    against the allegations.

On February 5, 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) Region IX delivered a Finding and Notice of
    Violation to the Forward Landfill as a result of alleged
    violations of the Title V permit issued under the Clean Air
    Act. The facility is jointly regulated by the EPA and the
    San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. The
    alleged violations include operating gas collection wellheads at
    greater than 15% oxygen, experiencing a subsurface oxidation
    event on multiple occasions, and submitting inaccurate
    compliance certifications. We have requested a conference with
    the agencies and intend to vigorously defend against the
    allegations.

Carbon
    Limestone Matter

On May 4, 2009, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
    (OEPA) issued Proposed Findings and Orders (F&Os) to Carbon
    Limestone Landfill, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary. The
    proposed F&Os allege violations regarding the acceptance of
    hazardous waste from two customers and issues regarding the
    site’s leachate management collection system and
    groundwater monitoring program, and seek corrective actions and
    a civil penalty of $155,311. After negotiations with OEPA, on
    December 15, 2009, Carbon Limestone Landfill, LLC and the
    OEPA agreed to a Director’s Findings and Final Order (DFFO)
    specifying a schedule of corrective actions and a civil penalty
    of $73,846, comprised of a single payment of $59,077, and
    funding of a supplemental environmental project costing $14,769.
    We have commenced payment and instituting the corrective actions
    as required by the DFFO.

Litigation
    Related to Fuel and Environmental Fees

On July 8, 2009, CLN Properties, Inc. and Maevers
    Management Company, Inc., filed a complaint against the Company
    and one of its subsidiaries in the United States District Court
    in Arizona, in which plaintiffs complain about fuel recovery
    fees and environmental recovery fees charged by the Company or
    one of its subsidiaries. On July 23, 2009, Klingler’s
    European Bake Shop & Deli, Inc., filed a complaint
    against the Company and one of its subsidiaries in the Circuit
    Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, in which plaintiff complains
    about fuel/environmental recovery fees and administrative fees
    charged by the Company or one of



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

its subsidiaries. The CLN Properties/Maevers complaint, which
    the plaintiffs amended on August 31, 2009, purports to be
    filed on behalf of a nationwide class of similarly-situated
    plaintiffs, while the Klingler’s complaint purports to be
    filed on behalf of a class of similarly situated plaintiffs in
    Alabama. Each complaint asserts various legal and equitable
    theories of recovery and alleges in essence that the fees were
    not properly disclosed, were unfair, and were contrary to
    contract. We filed motions to dismiss in both actions. On
    January 13, 2010, the court in the CLN/Maevers case granted
    our motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part. Plaintiff
    in the Klingler’s case voluntarily dismissed the action
    without prejudice on October 23, 2009 and subsequently
    re-filed a virtually identical complaint against a different
    subsidiary of the company on November 20, 2009. We recently
    moved to dismiss this new complaint. We will continue to
    vigorously defend the claims in both lawsuits.

Imperial
    Landfill Matter

On May 18, 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of
    Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the Allegheny County Health
    Department issued to the Imperial Landfill a proposed consent
    order and agreement for a series of alleged violations related
    to landfill gas, leachate control, cover management, and
    resulting nuisance odor complaints in late 2008 and 2009. PADEP
    subsequently issued additional notices of violation for similar
    alleged violations. The combined penalties proposed by the
    agencies total approximately $1 million. We are engaging in
    ongoing discussions with the agencies to reach a negotiated
    settlement, and have been aggressively working to correct any
    issues alleged in the order.

Litigation
    Related to the Merger with Allied

On December 3, 2008, the DOJ and seven state attorneys
    general filed a complaint, Hold Separate Stipulation and Order,
    and competitive impact statement, together with a proposed final
    judgment, in the United States District Court for the District
    of Columbia, in connection with approval under the HSR Act of
    our merger with Allied. The court entered the Hold Separate
    Stipulation and Order on December 4, 2008, which terminated
    the waiting period under the HSR Act and allowed the parties to
    close the transaction subject to the conditions described in the
    Hold Separate Stipulation and Order. These conditions include
    the divestiture of certain assets which were completed by
    September 30, 2009. However, the final judgment can only be
    approved by the court after the DOJ publishes a notice in the
    Federal Register and considers comments it receives. During this
    period, if the DOJ believes that the final judgment is no longer
    in the public interest, the DOJ may withdraw its support of the
    final judgment and seek to prevent the final judgment from
    becoming final in its present form. Likewise, the court may, in
    its discretion, modify the divestitures or other relief sought
    by the DOJ if the court believes that such modification is in
    the public interest. On July 16, 2009, the DOJ and the
    seven state attorneys general filed a motion seeking entry of
    the proposed final judgment. The precise timing for the
    confirmation of the final judgment is not known. Management
    believes that the court will enter the final judgment and that
    modifications to the final judgment, if any, will not be
    material.

Proxy
    Disclosure Matter

In late 2009, a Republic stockholder brought a lawsuit in
    Federal court in Delaware challenging our disclosures in our
    2009 proxy statement with respect to the Executive Incentive
    Plan (“EIP”) that was approved by our stockholders at
    the 2009 annual meeting. The lawsuit is styled as a combined
    proxy disclosure claim and derivative action. We are a defendant
    only with respect to the proxy disclosure claim, which seeks
    only to require us to make additional disclosures regarding the
    EIP and to hold a new stockholder vote prior to making any
    payments under the EIP. The derivative claim is purportedly
    brought on behalf of our company against all of our directors
    and the individuals who were executive officers at the time of
    the 2009 annual meeting and alleges, among other things, breach
    of fiduciary duty. That claim also seeks injunctive relief and
    seeks to recoup on behalf of our company an unspecified amount
    of the incentive compensation that may be paid to our executives
    under the EIP, as well as the amount of any tax deductions that
    may be lost if the EIP



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

does not comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue
    Code. We believe the lawsuit is without merit and is not
    material and intend to vigorously defend against the
    plaintiff’s allegations.

Contracting
    Matter

We recently discovered actions of non-compliance by one of our
    subsidiaries with the subcontracting provisions of certain
    government contracts in one of our markets. We reported the
    discovery to, and expect further discussions with, law
    enforcement authorities. Such non-compliance could result in
    payments by us in the form of restitution, damages, or
    penalties, or the loss of future business. Based on the
    information currently available to us, including our expectation
    that our self-disclosure will be viewed favorably by the
    applicable authorities, we presently believe that the resolution
    of the matter, while it may have a material impact on our
    results of operations or cash flows in the period in which it is
    recognized or paid, will not have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial position.

Congress
    Development Landfill Matters

Congress Development Co. (CDC) is a general partnership
    that owns and operates the Congress Landfill. The general
    partners in CDC are our subsidiary, Allied Waste Transportation,
    Inc. (Allied Transportation), and an unaffiliated entity, John
    Sexton Sand & Gravel Corporation (Sexton). Sexton was
    the operator of the landfill through early 2007, when Allied
    Transportation took over as the operator. The general partners
    likely will be jointly and severally liable for the costs
    associated with the following matters relating to the Congress
    Landfill.

In January 2006, CDC was issued an Agreed Preliminary Injunction
    and Order by the Circuit Court of Illinois, Cook County.
    Subsequently, the court issued two additional Supplemental
    Orders that required CDC to implement certain remedial actions
    at the Congress Landfill, which remedial actions are underway.

In a suit originally filed on December 23, 2009 in the
    Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois and subsequently amended
    to add additional plaintiffs, approximately 1,000 plaintiffs
    sued our subsidiaries Allied Transportation and Allied Waste
    Industries, Inc., CDC and Sexton. The plaintiffs allege bodily
    injury, property damage and inability to have normal use and
    enjoyment of property arising from, among other things, odors
    and other damages arising from landfill gas leaking, and they
    base their claims on negligence, trespass, and nuisance. The
    plaintiffs have requested actual damages in excess of
    $50 million and punitive damages of $50 million. We
    intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs’
    allegations in this action. We cannot at this time predict the
    ultimate outcome of this matter or the reasonably probable loss,
    if any.

Livingston
    Matter

On October 13, 2009, the Twenty-First Judicial District
    Court, Parish of Livingston, State of Louisiana, issued its Post
    Class Certification Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
    in a lawsuit alleging nuisance from the activities of the CECOS
    hazardous waste facility located in Livingston Parish,
    Louisiana. The court granted class certification for all those
    living within a six mile radius of the CECOS site between the
    years 1977 and 1990. The site last accepted waste in June 1990.
    The class certification order remains subject to appeal, and we
    intend to continue to defend this lawsuit vigorously.

Sunshine
    Canyon Matter

On November 17, 2009, the South Coast Air Quality
    Management District (District) issued an Order for Abatement as
    a result of a series of odor complaints alleged to be associated
    with the operations at the Sunshine Canyon Landfill located in
    Sylmar, California. The Order describes eight notices of
    violation beginning in November 2008 and continuing to November
    2009. The District Hearing Board held a



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

compliance hearing on December 17, 2009, at which we
    described the measures to mitigate the odors. A final order and
    settlement document has not been issued.

Lease
    Commitments

We and our subsidiaries lease real property, equipment and
    software under various operating leases with terms from one
    month to twenty years. Rent expense during the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $60.1 million,
    $19.3 million and $11.5 million, respectively.

Future minimum lease obligations under non-cancelable real
    property, equipment and software operating leases with initial

Royalties

We have entered into agreements to pay royalties to prior
    landowners, lessors or host communities where landfills are
    located, based on waste tonnage disposed at specified landfills.
    The payments are generally payable quarterly and amounts
    incurred, but not paid, are accrued in our consolidated balance
    sheets. Royalties are accrued as tonnage is disposed of in the
    landfills.

Disposal
    Agreements

We have several agreements expiring at various dates through
    2025 that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at
    third-party disposal facilities. Under these

put-or-pay

agreements, we are required to pay for

agreed-upon

minimum volumes regardless of the actual number of tons placed
    at the facilities.

Future minimum payments under unconditional purchase
    commitments, consisting primarily of (i) disposal related
    agreements which include fixed or minimum royalty payments, host
    agreements and

    Cash and Other Financial Guarantees

We are required to provide financial assurance to governmental
    agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable
    environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations
    for capping, closure and post-closure costs, and our performance
    under certain collection, landfill and transfer station
    contracts. We satisfy the



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds,
    letters of credit, insurance policies or trust deposits. The
    amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping,
    closure and post-closure costs is determined by applicable state
    environmental regulations, which vary by state. The financial
    assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure
    costs can either be for costs associated with a portion of the
    landfill or the entire landfill. Generally, states will require
    a third-party engineering specialist to determine the estimated
    capping, closure and post-closure costs that are used to
    determine the required amount of financial assurance for a
    landfill. The amount of financial assurance required can, and
    generally will, differ from the obligation determined and
    recorded under GAAP. The amount of the financial assurance
    requirements related to contract performance varies by contract.
    Additionally, we are required to provide financial assurance for
    our self-insurance program and collateral for certain
    performance obligations.

We had the following financial instruments and collateral in
    place to secure our financial assurances at December 31:

    respectively, of utilized availability under our Credit
    Facilities. Surety bonds expire on various dates through 2038.

These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of
    business and are not debt. Since we currently have no liability
    for this financial assurance, it is not reflected in our
    consolidated balance sheets. However, we have recorded capping,
    closure and post-closure obligations and self-insurance reserves
    as they are incurred. The underlying financial assurance
    obligations, in excess of those already reflected in our
    consolidated balance sheets, would be recorded if it is probable
    that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations. We
    do not expect this to occur.

Our restricted cash deposits include, among other things,
    restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt
    facilities, and restricted cash pledged to regulatory agencies
    and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our
    performance related to our final capping, closure and
    post-closure obligations at our landfills at December 31,

We own a 19.9% interest in a company that, among other

    companies operating in the solid waste industry. We account for
    this investment under the cost method of accounting. There have
    been no identified events or changes in circumstances that may
    have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the
    investment. This investee company and the parent company of the
    investee had written surety bonds for us relating to our
    landfill operations for capping, closure and post-closure, of
    which $775.2 million and $753.8 million were
    outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Our reimbursement obligations under these bonds are secured by
    an indemnity agreement with the investee and letters of credit
    totaling $67.4 million and $41.3 million as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



REPUBLIC

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other
    than operating leases and the financial assurances discussed
    above, which are not classified as debt. We have no transactions
    or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed,
    consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial
    position or results of operations. We have not guaranteed any
    third-party debt.

Guarantees

We enter into contracts in the normal course of business that
    include indemnification clauses. Indemnifications relating to
    known liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial
    statements based on our best estimate of required future
    payments. Certain of these indemnifications relate to contingent
    events or occurrences, such as the imposition of additional
    taxes due to a change in the tax law or adverse interpretation
    of the tax law, and indemnifications made in divestiture
    agreements where we indemnify the buyer for liabilities that
    relate to our activities prior to the divestiture and that may
    become known in the future. We do not believe that these
    contingent obligations will have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

We have entered into agreements with property owners to
    guarantee the value of certain property that is adjacent to
    certain of our landfills. These agreements have varying terms.
    We do not believe that these contingent obligations will have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

Other
    Matters

Our business activities are conducted in the context of a
    developing and changing statutory and regulatory framework.
    Governmental regulation of the waste management industry
    requires us to obtain and retain numerous governmental permits
    to conduct various aspects of our operations. These permits are
    subject to revocation, modification or denial. The costs and
    other capital expenditures which may be required to obtain or
    retain the applicable permits or comply with applicable
    regulations could be significant. Any revocation, modification
    or denial of permits could have a material adverse effect on us.

We are subject to various federal, state and local tax rules and
    regulations. Our compliance with such rules and regulations is
    periodically audited by tax authorities. These authorities may
    challenge the positions taken in our tax filings. As such, to
    provide for certain potential tax exposures, we maintain
    liabilities for uncertain tax positions for our estimate of the
    final outcome of the examinations. For further information
    related to our liabilities for uncertain tax positions, see
    Note 10,

Income Taxes.

We believe that the liabilities we have for uncertain tax
    positions recorded are adequate. However, a significant
    assessment against us in excess of the liabilities recorded
    could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

CONDENSED
    CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We are the primary obligor under certain of the Senior Notes
    issued by us. However, we have no independent assets or
    operations, and therefore substantially all of our subsidiaries
    have jointly and severally guaranteed these notes. Each of the
    subsidiary guarantors are 100% wholly owned subsidiaries of the
    parent, and all guarantees are full, unconditional and joint and

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

In the first quarter of 2010, we notified the registered holders
    of our 6.125% Senior Notes due 2014 (the 6.125% Senior
    Notes) that we will redeem all of the notes outstanding in March
    2010. The 6.125% Senior Notes will be redeemed at a price
    equal to 102.042% of the principal amount, of which
    $425.0 million is outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid
    interest. We expect to incur a charge upon extinguishment of the
    6.125% Senior Notes of approximately $52 million in
    the first quarter of 2010.

We have evaluated subsequent events through February 24,
    2010. No material subsequent events have occurred since
    December 31, 2009 that required recognition or disclosure
    in our current period financial statements, other than those
    discussed.



ITEM 9. 
    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON REPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.’S INTERNAL CONTROL
    OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We, as members of management of Republic Services, Inc. are
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
    Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
    management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable
    assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that
    could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control
    systems and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of
    the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
    of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
    issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

We, under the supervision of and with the participation of our
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
    Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, assessed the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria for effective
    internal control over financial reporting described in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, we concluded that
    we maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the specified
    criteria.

Our internal control over financial reporting has been audited
    by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is
    included herein.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(e),

and

15d-15(e))

as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based
    upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
    this Annual Report.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Based on an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, there has been no change in
    our internal control over financial reporting during our last
    fiscal quarter identified in connection with that evaluation,
    that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
