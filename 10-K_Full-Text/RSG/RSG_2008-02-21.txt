PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Company
    Overview

We are a leading provider of services in the domestic
    non-hazardous solid waste industry. We provide

non-hazardous

solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial,
    municipal and residential customers through 136 collection
    companies in 21 states. We also own or operate 94 transfer
    stations, 58 solid waste landfills and 33 recycling facilities.

As of December 31, 2007, our operations were organized into
    five regions whose boundaries may change from time to time:
    Eastern, Central, Southern, Southwestern and Western. Each
    region is organized into several operating areas and each area
    contains multiple operating locations. Each of our regions and
    substantially all our areas provide collection, transfer,
    recycling and disposal services. We believe that this
    organizational structure facilitates the integration of our
    operations within each region, which is a critical component of
    our operating strategy. See Note 10 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our
    operating segments.

We had revenue of $3,176.2 million and
    $3,070.6 million and operating income of
    $536.0 million and $519.5 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    $105.6 million, or 3.4%, increase in revenue and the
    $16.5 million, or 3.2%, increase in operating income from
    2006 to 2007 is primarily attributable to the successful
    execution of our operating and growth strategies described below.

Our presence in high growth markets throughout the Sunbelt,
    including California, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina,
    South Carolina and Texas, and in other domestic markets that
    have experienced higher than average population growth during
    the past several years, supports our internal growth strategy.
    We believe that our presence in these markets positions our
    company to experience growth at rates that are generally higher
    than the industry’s overall growth rate.

We continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by
    implementing our financial, operating and growth strategies as
    described below.

We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1996.

Industry
    Overview

Based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications,
    we believe that the United States non-hazardous solid waste
    services industry generates annual revenue of approximately
    $52 billion, of which approximately 58% is generated by
    publicly owned waste companies, 16% is generated by privately
    held waste companies, and 26% is generated by municipal and
    other local governmental authorities. Three companies generate
    the substantial majority of the publicly owned companies’
    total revenue. However, according to industry data, the
    non-hazardous waste industry in the United States remains highly
    fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other
    local governmental authorities generate approximately 42% of
    total industry revenue. In general, growth in the solid waste
    industry is linked to growth in the overall economy, including
    the level of new households and business formation.

Financial
    Strategy

Key components of our financial strategy include our ability to
    generate free cash flow and sustain or improve our return on
    invested capital. Our definition of free cash flow, which is not
    a measure determined in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles, is cash provided by operating
    activities less purchases of property and equipment, plus
    proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in
    our consolidated statements of cash flows. We believe that free
    cash flow is a driver of shareholder value and provides useful
    information regarding the recurring cash provided by our
    operating activities after expenditures for property and
    equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment.
    It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial
    strategy. Consequently, we have developed incentive programs and
    we conduct monthly field operating



reviews that help focus our entire company on the importance of
    increasing free cash flow and maintaining and improving returns
    on invested capital.

The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations.
    Free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for
    discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain
    expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such
    as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our
    definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly
    titled measures presented by other companies.

We manage our free cash flow primarily by ensuring that capital
    expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light
    of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely
    managing our working capital, which consists primarily of
    accounts receivable and accounts payable.

We have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize
    shareholder value as well as our return on investment. This
    includes the following:

•

Customer Service.

We will continue to reinvest
    in our existing fleet of vehicles, equipment, landfills and
    facilities to ensure a high level of service to our customers.

•

Internal Growth

Price Growth.

Growth through price increases
    is the most cost-effective means of expanding our business.
    Price increases also allow us to recover historical and current
    year increases in operating costs which ultimately enhances our
    operating margins.

Volume Growth.

Growth through increases in our
    customer base and services provided is the most capital
    efficient means for us to build our business. This includes not
    only expanding landfill and transfer capacity and investing in
    trucks and containers, but also includes investing in
    information tools and training needed to ensure high
    productivity and quality service throughout all functional areas
    of our business.

•

Market Rationalization.

We have and will
    continue to focus on further strengthening our business platform
    and improving our business integration. We will also continue to
    develop and implement strategies that improve the performance of
    our locations and lines of business that are performing below
    our company average. To achieve these objectives, we will
    continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that augment our
    existing business platform. In addition, we will continue to
    evaluate opportunities to divest of businesses in markets that
    have limited potential for vertical integration or inadequate
    returns on invested capital.

•

Share Repurchases.

If we are unable to
    identify opportunities that satisfy our growth strategy, we
    intend to continue to use our free cash flow to repurchase
    shares of our common stock at prices that provide value to our
    stockholders. As of December 31, 2007, we had repurchased a
    total of 74.8 million shares, or approximately 41% of our
    common stock outstanding at the commencement of our share
    repurchase program in 2000, for $2.2 billion. From 2000
    through 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase
    of $2.3 billion of our outstanding common stock, of which
    $136.4 million remained available for repurchases at
    December 31, 2007. In January 2008, our board of directors
    authorized the repurchase of an additional $250.0 million
    of our common stock. We believe that our share repurchase
    program will continue to enhance shareholder value.

•

Dividends.

In July 2003, our board of
    directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $.04 per share.
    The dividend was increased each year thereafter, the latest
    increase occurring in the third quarter of 2007. Our current
    quarterly dividend per share is $.17. We may consider increasing
    our quarterly cash dividend if we believe it will enhance
    shareholder value.

•

Maintain Our Credit Rating.

We believe that a
    key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining an
    investment grade rating on our senior debt. This has allowed us,
    and will continue to allow us, to readily access capital markets
    at competitive rates. As such, we intend to continue to use our
    free cash flow to repay our borrowings, if appropriate.

For certain risks related to our financial strategy, see
    Item 1A., “Risk Factors.”



Operating
    Strategy

We seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to
    increase operating margins and enhance shareholder value. Our
    operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the
    following:

•

utilize the extensive industry knowledge and experience of our
    executive management team,

•

utilize a decentralized management structure in overseeing
    day-to-day operations,

•

integrate waste operations,

•

improve operating margins through economies of scale, cost
    efficiencies and asset utilization,

•

achieve high levels of customer satisfaction, and

•

utilize business information systems to improve consistency in
    financial and operational performance.

For certain risks related to our operating strategy, see
    Item 1A., “Risk Factors.”

•

Experienced Executive Management
    Team.

We believe that we have one of the most
    experienced executive management teams in the solid waste
    industry.

James E. O’Connor, who has served as our Chief Executive
    Officer since December 1998, also became our Chairman in January
    2003. He worked at Waste Management, Inc. from 1972 to 1978 and
    from 1982 to 1998. During that time, he served in various
    management positions, including Senior Vice President in 1997
    and 1998, and Area President of Waste Management of Florida,
    Inc. from 1992 to 1997. Mr. O’Connor has over
    33 years of experience in the solid waste industry.

Michael J. Cordesman, who has served as our Chief Operating
    Officer since March 2002 and also as our President since
    February 2003, has over 27 years of experience in the solid
    waste industry. He joined us in June 2001 as our Eastern Region
    Vice President. From 1999 to 2001, Mr. Cordesman served as
    Vice President of the Central Region for Superior Services Inc.
    From 1980 to 1999, he served in various positions with Waste
    Management, Inc., including Vice President of the Mid-Atlantic
    Region from 1992 to 1999.

The other corporate officers with responsibility for our
    operations have an average of over 26 years of management
    experience in the solid waste industry. Our five regional vice
    presidents and our 21 area presidents have an average of
    26 years of experience in the industry.

In addition, Harris W. Hudson, who has served as our Vice
    Chairman since our initial public offering in 1998, has over
    43 years of experience in the solid waste industry,
    including 11 years with Waste Management, Inc. and
    19 years with private waste collection companies.

•

Decentralized Management Structure.

We
    maintain a relatively small corporate headquarters staff,
    relying on a decentralized management structure to minimize
    administrative overhead costs and to manage our day-to-day
    operations more efficiently. Our local management has extensive
    industry experience in growing, operating and managing solid
    waste companies and has substantial experience in their local
    geographic markets. Each regional management team includes a
    vice president, controller, sales manager, maintenance manager
    and an operations manager. We believe that our strong regional
    management teams allow us to more effectively and efficiently
    drive our company’s initiatives and help ensure consistency
    throughout our organization. Our regional management teams and
    our area presidents have extensive authority, responsibility and
    autonomy for operations within their respective geographic
    markets. Compensation for our area management teams is primarily
    based on the improvement in operating income produced and the
    free cash flow and return on invested capital generated in each
    manager’s geographic area of responsibility. In addition,
    through long-term incentive programs, including stock options,
    we believe we have one of the lowest turnover levels in the
    industry for our local management teams. As a result of
    retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and
    involvement in their local communities, we are proactive in
    anticipating our customers’ needs and adjusting to changes
    in our markets. We also seek to implement the best practices of
    our various regions and areas throughout our operations to
    improve operating margins.



•

Integrated Operations.

We seek to
    achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste
    streams from the point of collection through disposal. We expect
    that our fully integrated markets generally will have a lower
    cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our
    non-integrated markets. Through acquisitions, landfill operating
    agreements and other market development activities, we create

market-specific,

integrated operations typically consisting of one or more
    collection companies, transfer stations and landfills. We
    consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with
    significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels
    of waste volume. We also seek to acquire solid waste collection
    companies in markets in which we own or operate landfills. In
    addition, we generate internal growth in our disposal operations
    by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills
    from time to time in markets in which we have significant
    collection operations or in markets that we determine lack
    sufficient disposal capacity. During the three months ended
    December 31, 2007, approximately 58% of the total volume of
    waste that we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or
    operate. In a number of our larger markets, we and our
    competitors are required to take waste to government-controlled
    disposal facilities. This provides us with an opportunity to
    effectively compete in these markets without investing in
    landfill capacity. Because we do not have landfill facilities or
    government-controlled disposal facilities for all markets in
    which we provide collection services, we believe that through
    landfill and transfer station acquisitions, operating agreements
    and development we have the opportunity to increase our waste
    internalization rate and further integrate our operations. By
    further integrating operations in existing markets through
    acquisitions, operating agreements and development of landfills
    and transfer stations, we may be able to reduce our disposal
    costs.

•

Economies of Scale, Cost Efficiencies and Asset
    Utilization.

To improve operating margins,
    our management focuses on achieving economies of scale and cost
    efficiencies. The consolidation of acquired businesses into
    existing operations reduces costs by decreasing capital and
    expenses used for routing, personnel, equipment and vehicle
    maintenance, inventories and back-office administration.
    Generally, we consolidate our acquired administrative centers to
    reduce our general and administrative costs. Our goal is to
    maintain our selling, general and administrative costs at
    approximately 10.0% to 10.5% of revenue, which we feel is
    appropriate given our existing business platform. In addition,
    our size allows our company to negotiate volume discounts for
    certain purchases, including waste disposal rates at landfills
    operated by third parties. Furthermore, we have taken steps to
    increase utilization of our assets. For example, to reduce the
    number of collection vehicles and maximize the efficiency of our
    fleet, we use a grid productivity program which allows us to
    benchmark the performance of all of our drivers. In our larger
    markets, we also use a route optimization program to minimize
    drive times and improve operating density. By using assets more
    efficiently, operating expenses can be reduced.

•

High Levels of Customer
    Satisfaction.

Our goal of maintaining high
    levels of customer satisfaction complements our operating
    strategy. Our personalized sales process is oriented towards
    maintaining relationships and ensuring that service is being
    properly provided.

•

Utilize Systems to Improve Consistency in Financial and
    Operational Performance.

We continue to focus
    on systems and training initiatives that complement our
    operating strategy. These initiatives include customer
    relationship management, billing, productivity, maintenance,
    general ledger and human resource systems. These systems provide
    us with detailed information, prepared in a consistent manner,
    that allows us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our
    business.

For certain risks related to our operating strategy, see
    Item 1A., “Risk Factors.”

Growth
    Strategy

Our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue, gaining
    market share and enhancing shareholder value through internal
    growth and acquisitions. For certain risks related to our growth
    strategy, see Item 1A., “Risk Factors.”

•

Internal Growth.

Our internal growth
    strategy focuses on retaining existing customers and obtaining
    commercial, municipal and industrial customers through our
    well-managed sales and marketing activities.



Pricing Activities.

We seek to secure price
    increases necessary to offset increased costs and to improve our
    operating margins. During 2007, we continued to secure
    broad-based price increases across all lines of our business to
    offset various escalating capital and operating costs, including
    fuel. Price increases will remain a major component of our
    overall future operating strategy.

Long-Term Contracts.

We seek to obtain
    long-term contracts for collecting solid waste in high-growth
    markets. These include exclusive franchise agreements with
    municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts.
    By obtaining such long-term agreements, we have the opportunity
    to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the
    underlying population growth in these markets. For example, we
    have secured exclusive, long-term franchise agreements in
    high-growth markets such as Los Angeles, Orange and Contra Costa
    Counties in California, Las Vegas, Nevada, Arlington, Texas, and
    many areas of Florida. We believe that this positions our
    company to experience internal growth rates that are generally
    higher than our industry’s overall growth rate. In
    addition, we believe that by securing a base of long-term
    recurring revenue in high-growth markets, we are better able to
    protect our market position from competition and our business
    may be less susceptible to downturns in economic conditions.

Sales and Marketing Activities.

We seek to
    manage our sales and marketing activities to enable our company
    to capitalize on our leading position in many of the markets in
    which we operate. We currently have approximately 500 sales and
    marketing employees in the field who are compensated using a
    commission structure that is focused on generating high levels
    of quality revenue. For the most part, these employees directly
    solicit business from existing and prospective commercial,
    industrial, municipal and residential customers. We emphasize
    our rate and cost structures when we train new and existing
    sales personnel. In addition, we utilize a customer relationship
    management system that assists our sales people in tracking
    leads. It also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial,
    industrial and franchise contracts.

Development Activities.

We seek to identify
    opportunities to further our position as an integrated service
    provider in markets where we provide services for a portion of
    the waste stream. Where appropriate, we seek to obtain permits
    to build transfer stations and landfills that would provide
    vertically integrated waste services or expand the service areas
    for our existing disposal sites. Development projects, while
    generally less capital intensive, typically require extensive
    permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no
    assurance of success. We undertake development projects when we
    believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where
    reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available.

•

Acquisition Growth.

During the late
    1990s, the solid waste industry experienced a period of rapid
    consolidation. We were able to grow significantly through
    acquisitions during this period. However, the rate of
    consolidation in the industry has slowed considerably. Despite
    this, we continue to look to acquire businesses that complement
    our existing business platform. Our acquisition growth strategy
    focuses on privately held solid waste companies and municipal
    and other local governmental authorities. We believe that our
    ability to acquire privately held companies is enhanced by
    increasing competition in the solid waste industry, increasing
    capital requirements as a result of changes in solid waste
    regulatory requirements, and the limited number of exit
    strategies for these privately held companies’ owners and
    principals. We also seek to acquire operations and facilities
    from municipalities that are privatizing, which occurs for many
    of the same reasons that privately held companies sell their
    solid waste businesses. In addition, we will continue to
    evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that
    are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies. In
    sum, our acquisition growth strategy focuses on the following:

•

acquiring businesses that position our company for growth in
    existing and new markets,

•

acquiring well-managed companies and, when appropriate,
    retaining local management, and

•

acquiring operations and facilities from municipalities that are
    privatizing and publicly owned companies that are divesting of
    assets.

We also seek to acquire landfills, transfer stations and
    collection companies that operate in markets that we are already
    servicing in order to fully integrate our operations from
    collection to disposal. In addition, we have in the past and may
    continue in the future to exchange businesses with other solid
    waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our
    business platform. These activities allow us to increase our
    revenue



and market share, lower our cost of operations as a percentage
    of revenue, and consolidate duplicative facilities and functions
    to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of scale.

Operations

Our operations primarily consist of the collection, transfer and
    disposal of non-hazardous solid waste.

Collection Services.

We provide solid waste
    collection services to commercial, industrial, municipal and
    residential customers in 21 states through 136 collection
    companies. In 2007, 75.9% of our revenue was derived from
    collection services. Within the collection line of business,
    33.2% of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and
    residential customers, 39.2% is from services provided to
    commercial customers, and 27.6% is from services provided to
    industrial and other customers.

Our residential collection operations involve the curbside
    collection of refuse from small containers into collection
    vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to
    landfills. Residential solid waste collection services are
    typically performed under contracts with municipalities, which
    we generally secure by competitive bid and which give our
    company exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the
    homes in their respective jurisdictions. These contracts or
    franchises usually range in duration from one to five years,
    although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly
    longer periods. Residential solid waste collection services may
    also be performed on a subscription basis, in which individual
    households contract directly with our company. The fees received
    for subscription residential collection are based primarily on
    market factors, frequency and type of service, the distance to
    the disposal facility and cost of disposal. In general,
    subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in
    advance by the residential customers receiving the service.

In our commercial and industrial collection operations, we
    supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes. We
    also rent compactors to large waste generators. Commercial
    collection services are generally performed under one- to
    three-year service agreements, and fees are determined by
    considerations such as the following:

•

market factors,

•

collection frequency,

•

type of equipment furnished,

•

the type and volume or weight of the waste collected,

•

the distance to the disposal facility, and

•

the cost of disposal.

We rent waste containers to construction sites and also provide
    waste collection services to industrial and construction
    facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a
    single pickup to one year or longer. Our construction services
    are provided to the commercial construction and home building
    sectors. We collect the containers or compacted waste and
    transport the waste either to a landfill or a transfer station
    for disposal.

Also, we provide recycling services in certain markets in
    compliance with local laws or the terms of our franchise
    agreements. These services include the curbside collection of
    residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of
    recycling services to commercial and industrial customers.

Transfer and Disposal Services.

We own or
    operate 94 transfer stations. We deposit waste at these transfer
    stations, as do other private haulers and municipal haulers, for
    compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal
    sites or recycling facilities. As of December 31, 2007, we
    owned or operated 58 landfills, which had 9,707 permitted
    acres and total available permitted and probable expansion
    disposal capacity of approximately 1.7 billion in-place
    cubic yards. The in-place capacity of our landfills is subject
    to change based on engineering factors, requirements of
    regulatory authorities, our ability to continue to operate our
    landfills in compliance with applicable regulations, and our
    ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain
    expansion permits at our sites. Some of our landfills accept
    non-hazardous special waste, including utility ash, asbestos and
    contaminated soils. See Item 2., “Properties.”



Most of our existing landfill sites have the potential for
    expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted
    acreage. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal
    capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue
    expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste
    volumes and prices, market needs, remaining capacity and
    likelihood of obtaining an expansion. To satisfy future disposal
    demand, we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at
    certain of our landfills. However, no assurances can be made
    that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as
    designed.

Recycling Facilities and Other Services.

We
    have 33 materials recovery facilities and other recycling
    operations. These facilities sort recyclable paper, aluminum,
    glass and other materials. Most of these recyclable materials
    are internally collected by our residential collection
    operations. In some areas, we receive commercial and industrial
    solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable
    materials and non-recyclable waste. The recyclable materials are
    salvaged, repackaged and sold to third parties and the
    non-recyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators.

We provided remediation and other heavy construction services
    primarily through our subsidiary located in Missouri. We sold
    this subsidiary during the fourth quarter of 2005 because it did
    not complement our core business strategy.

Our Texas-based compost, mulch and soil business at which yard,
    mill and other waste was processed, packaged and sold as various
    products was sold during the fourth quarter of 2007 because it
    did not complement our core business strategy.

Sales and
    Marketing

We seek to provide quality services that will enable our company
    to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction. We derive our
    business from a broad customer base, which we believe will
    enable our company to experience stable growth. We focus our
    marketing efforts on continuing and expanding business with
    existing customers, as well as attracting new customers.

We employ approximately 500 sales and marketing employees. Our
    sales and marketing strategy is to provide high-quality,
    comprehensive solid waste collection, recycling, transfer and
    disposal services to our customers at competitive prices. We
    target potential customers of all sizes, from small quantity
    generators to large “Fortune 500” companies and
    municipalities.

Most of our marketing activity is local in nature. However, we
    also provide a corporate accounts program in response to the
    needs of some of our customers.

We generally do not change the tradenames of the local
    businesses we acquire, and therefore we do not operate
    nationally under any one mark or tradename. Rather, we often
    rely on the goodwill associated with the acquired
    companies’ local tradenames as used in each geographic
    market in which we operate.

Customers

We provide services to commercial, industrial, municipal and
    residential customers. No one customer has individually
    accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of
    our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Entry into our
    business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry
    requires substantial amounts of capital and managerial
    experience.

Competition in the non-hazardous solid waste industry comes from
    a few large, national publicly owned companies, including Waste
    Management, Inc. and Allied Waste Industries, Inc., several
    regional publicly and privately owned solid waste companies, and
    thousands of small privately owned companies. Some of our
    competitors have significantly larger operations and may have
    significantly greater financial resources than we do. In
    addition to national and regional firms and numerous local
    companies, we compete with municipalities that



maintain waste collection or disposal operations. These
    municipalities may have financial advantages due to the
    availability of tax revenue and tax-exempt financing.

We compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of
    price and the quality of our services. From time to time, our
    competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort
    to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal
    contract. Our ability to increase prices in certain markets may
    be impacted by the pricing policies of our competitors. This may
    have an impact on our future revenue and profitability.

In each market in which we own or operate a landfill, we compete
    for landfill business on the basis of disposal costs, geographic
    location and quality of operations. Our ability to obtain
    landfill business may be limited by the fact that some major
    collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they
    send their waste. There also has been an increasing trend at the
    state and local levels to mandate waste reduction at the source
    and to prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as
    yard waste, at landfills. This may result in the volume of waste
    going to landfills being reduced in certain areas, which may
    affect our ability to operate our landfills at their full
    capacity or affect the prices that we can charge for landfill
    disposal services. In addition, most of the states in which we
    operate landfills have adopted plans or requirements that set
    goals for specified percentages of certain solid waste items to
    be recycled.

Seasonality
    and Severe Weather

Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement
    or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste
    collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding
    compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste,
    reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or
    delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and
    other facilities.

Regulation

Our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of
    federal, state and local requirements that regulate the
    environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use.
    Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals are
    generally required for landfills and transfer stations, certain
    solid waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and other
    facilities that we own or operate, and these permits are subject
    to revocation, modification and renewal in certain
    circumstances. Federal, state and local laws and regulations
    vary, but generally govern wastewater or stormwater discharges,
    air emissions, the handling, transportation, treatment, storage
    and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the
    remediation of contamination associated with the release or
    threatened release of hazardous substances. These laws and
    regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers
    of enforcement, which include the ability to revoke or decline
    to renew any of our operating permits, obtain injunctions, or
    impose fines or penalties in the case of violations, including
    criminal penalties. The U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency and various other federal, state and local environmental,
    public and occupational health and safety agencies and
    authorities administer these regulations, including the
    Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the
    U.S. Department of Labor.

We strive to conduct our operations in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations. However, in the existing
    climate of heightened environmental concerns, from time to time,
    we have been issued citations or notices from governmental
    authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for
    remedial work and related activities at various landfills and
    other facilities. There is no assurance that citations and
    notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory
    compliance efforts. We have established final capping, closure,
    post-closure and remediation liabilities that we believe, based
    on currently available information, will be adequate to cover
    our current estimates of regulatory costs. However, we cannot
    assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves.

Federal Regulation.

The following summarizes
    the primary environmental, public and occupational health and
    safety-related statutes of the United States that affect our
    facilities and operations:

(1)

The Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, including
    the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

RCRA
    and its implementing regulations establish a framework for
    regulating the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and
    disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste, and require
    states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid
    waste in sanitary landfills.



Subtitle D of RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the
    disposal of municipal solid waste. Regulations under Subtitle D
    currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management
    criteria and guidelines, including location restrictions,
    facility design and operating criteria, final capping, closure
    and post-closure requirements, financial assurance standards,
    groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action
    standards, many of which had not commonly been in effect or
    enforced in the past in connection with municipal solid waste
    landfills. Each state was required to submit to the
    U.S. EPA a permit program designed to implement Subtitle D
    regulations by April 9, 1993. All of the states in which we
    operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to RCRA and
    Subtitle D. These state permit programs may include landfill
    requirements which are more stringent than those of Subtitle D.
    Our failure to comply with the environmental requirements of
    federal, state and local authorities at any of our locations may
    lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit.

All of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill
    development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed
    Subtitle D requirements. Operating and design criteria for
    existing operations have been modified to comply with these
    regulations. Compliance with Subtitle D regulations has resulted
    in increased costs and may in the future require substantial
    additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally
    associated with our waste management activities.

(2)

The Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as
    amended.

CERCLA, among other things, provides for
    the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened
    release of a hazardous substance into the environment. CERCLA
    may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of
    cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners
    and operators of a site, parties who were owners or operators of
    a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of,
    parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site and
    parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous
    substances at a site. Under the authority of CERCLA and its
    implementing regulations, detailed requirements apply to the
    manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities
    and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened
    to be released into the environment. Liability under CERCLA is
    not dependent on the existence or disposal of only
    “hazardous wastes” but can also be based upon the
    existence of small quantities of more than 700
    “substances” characterized by the U.S. EPA as
    “hazardous,” many of which may be found in common
    household waste.

Among other things, CERCLA authorizes the federal government to
    investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances
    have been or are threatened to be released into the environment
    or to order (or offer an opportunity to) persons potentially
    liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so. In
    addition, the U.S. EPA has established a National
    Priorities List of sites at which hazardous substances have been
    or are threatened to be released and which require investigation
    or cleanup.

Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the intentional
    disposal of hazardous waste. It can be founded upon the release
    or threatened release, even as a result of unintentional,
    non-negligent or lawful action, of thousands of hazardous
    substances, including very small quantities of such substances.
    Thus, even if our landfills have never knowingly received
    hazardous waste as such, it is possible that one or more
    hazardous substances may have been deposited or
    “released” at our landfills or at other properties
    which we currently own or operate or may have owned or operated.
    Therefore, we could be liable under CERCLA for the cost of
    cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for
    damages to natural resources, even if those substances were
    deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them.
    The costs of a CERCLA cleanup can be very expensive. Given the
    difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment
    liability, such liability could have a material impact on our
    business, financial condition or results of operations.

(3)

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as
    amended.

This Act regulates the discharge of
    pollutants from a variety of sources, including solid waste
    disposal sites, into streams, rivers and other waters of the
    United States. Point source runoff from our landfills and
    transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters must be
    covered by discharge permits that generally require us to
    conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under certain
    circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those
    discharges. Storm water discharge regulations under this Act
    require a permit for certain construction activities and
    discharges from industrial



operations and facilities, which may affect our operations. If a
    landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a
    sewage system to a publicly owned treatment works, the facility
    must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment
    works. In addition, states may adopt groundwater protection
    programs under this Act or the Safe Drinking Water Act that
    could affect solid waste landfills. Furthermore, development
    which alters or affects wetlands must generally be permitted
    prior to such development commencing, and certain mitigation
    requirements may be required by the permitting agencies.

(4)

The Clean Air Act, as amended.

The
    Clean Air Act imposes limitations on emissions from various
    sources, including landfills. In March 1996, the U.S. EPA
    promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste
    landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems. These
    regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction,
    reconstruction or modification on or after May 30, 1991,
    and, principally, to landfills that can accommodate
    2.5 million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste.
    The regulations apply whether the landfill is active or closed.
    The date by which each affected landfill is required to have a
    gas collection and control system installed and made operational
    varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill.
    Many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring
    systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas.

(5)

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as
    amended.

This Act authorizes the Occupational
    Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of
    Labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards. A
    number of these standards, including standards for notices of
    hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos, apply to our
    facilities and operations.

State Regulation.

Each state in which we
    operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste
    disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases
    and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such
    matters. States also have adopted regulations governing the
    design, operation, maintenance and closure of landfills and
    transfer stations. Our facilities and operations are likely to
    be subject to these types of requirements. In addition, our
    solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected
    by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of
    solid waste reduction and recycling programs. For example,
    several states have enacted laws that require counties or
    municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce, through
    solid waste planning, composting, recycling or other programs,
    the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills. Additionally,
    laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste
    in solid waste landfills, including yard waste, newspapers,
    beverage containers, unshredded tires, lead-acid batteries and
    household appliances, have been promulgated in several states
    and are being considered in others. Legislative and regulatory
    measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source
    and waste recycling also are or have been under consideration by
    the U.S. Congress and the U.S. EPA, respectively.

In order to construct, expand and operate a landfill, one or
    more construction or operating permits, as well as zoning and
    land use approvals, must be obtained. These permits and
    approvals may be difficult and time-consuming to obtain and to
    operate in compliance with, are often opposed by neighboring
    landowners and citizens’ groups, may be subject to periodic
    renewal, and are subject to modification, non-renewal and
    revocation by the issuing agency. In connection with our
    acquisition of existing landfills, it may be and on occasion has
    been necessary for our company to expend considerable time,
    effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into
    compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the
    permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity.

Many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks
    which are generally used to store petroleum-based products.
    These tanks are generally subject to federal, state and local
    laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing,
    upgrading, closure and removal, and that, in the event of leaks,
    require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated. We
    believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet
    all applicable regulations. If underground storage tanks we own
    or operate leak, and the leakage migrates onto the property of
    others, we could be liable for response costs and other damages
    to third parties. We are unaware of facts indicating that issues
    of compliance with regulations related to underground storage
    tanks will have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Finally, with regard to our solid waste transportation
    operations, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface
    Transportation Board and are regulated by the Federal Highway
    Administration, Office of Motor Carriers, and by regulatory
    agencies in states that regulate such matters. Various states
    have enacted or promulgated, or are considering



enacting or promulgating, laws and regulations that would
    restrict the interstate transportation and processing of solid
    waste. In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a law
    that restricts the importation of

out-of-state

solid waste was unconstitutional; however, states have attempted
    to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and
    implicated by that ruling. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled that
    a flow control law, which attempted to restrict solid waste from
    leaving its place of generation, imposed an impermissible burden
    upon interstate commerce, and, therefore, was unconstitutional;
    however, states have also attempted to distinguish proposed laws
    from those involved in and implicated by that ruling. In
    response to these Supreme Court rulings, the U.S. Congress
    has considered passing legislation authorizing state and local
    governments to restrict the free movement of solid waste in
    interstate commerce. If federal legislation authorizing state
    and local governments to restrict the free movement of solid
    waste in interstate commerce is enacted, such legislation could
    adversely affect our operations.

We have established liabilities for landfill and environmental
    costs, which include landfill site final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs. We periodically reassess such costs based on
    various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and
    the technical requirements of Subtitle D of RCRA and adjust our
    rates used to expense final capping, closure and post-closure
    costs accordingly. Based on current information and regulatory
    requirements, we believe that our liabilities recorded for such
    landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate. However,
    environmental laws may change, and there can be no assurance
    that our recorded liabilities will be adequate to cover
    requirements under existing or new environmental laws and
    regulations, future changes or interpretations of existing laws
    and regulations, or the identification of adverse environmental
    conditions previously unknown to us.

Liability
    Insurance and Bonding

The nature of our business exposes our company to the risk of
    liabilities arising out of our operations, including possible
    damages to the environment. Such potential liabilities could
    involve, for example, claims for remediation costs, personal
    injury, property damage and damage to the environment in cases
    where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful
    materials; claims of employees, customers or third parties for
    personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of
    our operations; or claims alleging negligence in the planning or
    performance of work. We could also be subject to fines and civil
    and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of
    regulatory requirements. Because of the nature and scope of the
    possible environmental damages, liabilities imposed in
    environmental litigation can be significant. Our solid waste
    operations have third-party environmental liability insurance
    with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations,
    subject to certain limitations and exclusions. However, we
    cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance
    would be adequate, in scope or amount, in the event of a major
    loss, nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry
    excess environmental liability insurance should market
    conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs
    prohibitive.

We have general liability, vehicle liability, employment
    practices liability, pollution liability, directors and officers
    liability, workers’ compensation and employer’s
    liability coverage, as well as umbrella liability policies to
    provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in
    these primary policies. We also carry property insurance.
    Although we try to operate safely and prudently and while we
    have, subject to limitations and exclusions, substantial
    liability insurance, no assurance can be given that we will not
    be exposed to uninsured liabilities which could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows.

Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. Claims in excess of
    self-insurance levels are fully insured subject to policy
    limits. Accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial
    estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not
    reported. Due to the variable condition of the insurance market,
    we have experienced, and may continue to experience in the
    future, increased self-insurance retention levels and increased
    premiums. As we assume more risk for self-insurance through
    higher retention levels, we may experience more variability in
    our self-insurance reserves and expense.

In the normal course of business, we may be required to post
    performance bonds, insurance policies, letters of credit, or
    cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with
    municipal residential collection contracts, the operation,
    closure or post-closure of landfills, environmental remediation,
    environmental permits, and business licenses and permits as a
    financial guarantee of our performance. To date, we have
    satisfied financial responsibility



requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or
    by obtaining bank letters of credit, insurance policies or
    surety bonds.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we employed approximately
    13,000 full-time employees, approximately 3,300 of whom
    were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our management
    believes that we have good relations with our employees.

Compensation

We believe that our compensation program effectively aligns our
    field and corporate management team with the company’s
    overall goal of generating increasing amounts of free cash flow
    while achieving targeted earnings and returns on invested
    capital. This is done by utilizing simple and measurable metrics
    on which incentive pay is based. At the field level, these
    metrics are based on free cash flow, earnings and return on
    invested capital for each manager’s geographic area of
    responsibility. Great effort is taken to ensure that these goals
    agree with the overall goals of the company. Incentive
    compensation at the corporate level is based on the obtainment
    of our company’s overall goals. In addition, certain field
    and corporate employees also participate in a long-term
    incentive program. We believe this program aligns our
    company’s short- and long-term goals and helps ensure that
    the long-term success of our company is not sacrificed for the
    obtainment of short-term goals.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Risk
    Factors

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

includes “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934, as amended, including, in particular, certain statements
    about our plans, strategies and prospects. Although we believe
    that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or
    suggested by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we
    cannot assure you that such plans, intentions or expectations
    will be achieved. Important factors that could cause our actual
    results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements
    include those set forth in this Risk Factors section. All
    forward-looking statements attributable to us or any persons
    acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety
    by the cautionary statements set forth below. Unless the context
    requires otherwise, all references to the “company,”
    “we,” “us,” or “our” include
    Republic Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

If any of the following risks, or other risks not presently
    known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant,
    develop into actual events, then our business, financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could
    be materially adversely affected.

We
    operate in a highly competitive industry and may be unable to
    compete effectively.

We operate in a highly competitive business environment. Some of
    our competitors have significantly larger operations and may
    have significantly greater financial resources than we do. We
    also compete with municipalities



that maintain their own waste collection or disposal operations.
    These municipalities may have a financial advantage over us as a
    result of the availability of tax revenue and tax-exempt
    financing.

In each market in which we own or operate a landfill, we compete
    for solid waste volume on the basis of disposal or
    “tipping” fees, geographic location and quality of
    operations. Our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our
    landfills may be limited by the fact that some major collection
    companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their
    waste. In markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill,
    our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully
    integrated competitors.

As a result of these factors, we may have difficulty competing
    effectively from time to time.

We may be
    unable to obtain future increases in the prices for our
    services.

We compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of
    price and the quality of services. In addition, we seek to
    secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs and
    to improve our operating margins. From time to time, our
    competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort
    to expand their market share. General economic or market
    specific conditions may also limit our ability to raise prices.
    As a result of these factors, we may be unable to offset
    increases in costs and improve our operating margins through
    price increases. We may also lose volume to lower-cost
    competitors.

Economic
    conditions could adversely affect our business, operations and
    internal growth.

Previous economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion
    of our collection business servicing the manufacturing sector
    and the residential and non-residential construction industries.
    Landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction
    activity have also been impacted. A slowdown in the economy in
    any of the markets we service could adversely affect volumes,
    pricing and operating margins in our collection, transfer and
    disposal operations.

An
    increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our
    business.

Our operations are dependent on fuel, which we generally
    purchase in the open market on a daily basis. Direct fuel costs
    include the cost of fuel and other petroleum-based products used
    to operate our fleet of vehicles and heavy equipment. We are
    also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel costs which
    include fuel surcharges from vendors, increases in construction
    and excavation costs, and increases in the costs of other
    petroleum-based products such as synthetic landfill liners.
    During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we experienced significant increases
    in the cost of fuel and other petroleum-based products. A
    portion of these increases was passed on to our customers.
    However, because of the competitive nature of the waste
    industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass
    on current or future increases in fuel prices to our customers.
    Due to a number of factors, including political instability in
    some oil-producing countries, fuel prices may continue to
    fluctuate significantly in 2008. A significant increase in fuel
    costs could adversely affect our business, results of operations
    or cash flows.

We may be
    unable to execute our financial strategy.

Our ability to execute our financial strategy is dependent on
    our ability to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior
    debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon a number of
    factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Our financial strategy is also dependent on our ability to
    generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing
    business, fund our internal growth, acquire other solid waste
    businesses, repurchase shares of our common stock, pay
    dividends, minimize our borrowings and take other actions to
    enhance shareholder value. We cannot assure you that we will be
    successful in executing our broad-based pricing program, that we
    will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial
    strategy, that we will continue to repurchase our common stock,
    or that we will be able to pay cash dividends or increase the
    amount of our dividends.



We may be
    unable to manage our growth effectively.

Our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial,
    operational and management resources. In order to continue our
    growth, we will need to add administrative and other personnel,
    and make additional investments in operations and systems. We
    cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train
    qualified personnel, or do so on a timely basis, or expand our
    operations and systems to the extent, and in the time, required.

We may be
    unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy.

Our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on
    our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition
    candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate
    acquired operations into our business. The consolidation of our
    operations with the operations of acquired companies, including
    the consolidation of systems, procedures, personnel and
    facilities, the relocation of staff, and the achievement of
    anticipated cost savings, economies of scale and other business
    efficiencies, presents significant challenges to our management,
    particularly if several acquisitions occur at the same time. We
    cannot assure you that:

•

desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified,

•

we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified,

•

we will effectively consolidate companies which we acquire and
    fully or timely realize expected cost savings, economies of
    scale or business efficiencies, or

•

any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings.

Additional factors may negatively impact our acquisition growth
    strategy. Our acquisition strategy may require spending
    significant amounts of capital. If we are unable to obtain
    additional needed financing on acceptable terms, we may need to
    reduce the scope of our acquisition growth strategy, which could
    have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects. The
    intense competition among our competitors pursuing the same
    acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for solid
    waste businesses and increase our capital requirements or
    prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates. If any
    of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth
    strategy, our growth prospects could be adversely affected.

Businesses
    we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities.

In pursuing our acquisition strategy, our investigations of the
    acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed
    liabilities of the acquisition candidates. If we acquire a
    company having undisclosed liabilities, as a successor owner we
    may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities. We
    typically try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by
    obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired
    companies, by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase
    price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only
    specified assets. However, we cannot assure you that we will be
    able to obtain indemnifications or that they will be
    enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or
    duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising
    from our acquisitions.

Compliance
    with environmental and other laws and regulations may impede our
    growth and impact our financial results.

We may need to spend considerable time, effort and capital to
    keep our facilities in compliance with federal, state and local
    requirements regulating health, safety, environment, zoning,
    land use and transportation. In addition, some of our waste
    operations that cross state boundaries could be adversely
    affected if the federal government, or the state or locality in
    which these waste operations are located, imposes fees on, or
    otherwise limits or prohibits, the transportation or disposal of
    solid waste. If environmental laws become more stringent, our
    environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental
    compliance may increase in the future. In addition, due to the
    possibility of unanticipated events or regulatory developments,
    the amounts and timing of future environmental expenditures
    could vary substantially from those we currently anticipate.
    Because of the nature of our operations, we have in the past,
    currently are, and may in the future be named as a potentially
    responsible party in connection with the investigation or
    remediation of environmental conditions. We cannot assure you
    that the resolution of any such



investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. A
    significant judgment or fine against our company, or the loss of
    a significant permit or license due to modification, non-renewal
    or revocation by the issuing agency, could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flows or growth prospects. See Item 3.,
    “Legal Proceedings,” for further information.

Regulatory
    approval to operate, develop or expand our landfills and
    transfer stations may be delayed or denied.

Our plans include developing new landfills and transfer
    stations, as well as expanding the disposal and transfer
    capacities of certain of our landfills and transfer stations,
    respectively. Various parties, including citizens’ groups
    and local politicians, sometimes challenge our operations and
    these projects. Responding to these challenges has, at times,
    increased our costs and extended the time associated with
    establishing new facilities and operating and expanding existing
    facilities. In addition, failure to receive regulatory and
    zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities
    and operating and expanding existing facilities.

Our
    financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that
    may differ from actual results.

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and
    necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions
    made by us. Actual results could differ from these amounts.
    Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions
    include the carrying value of long-lived assets, the depletion
    and amortization of landfill development costs, accruals for
    final capping, closure and

post-closure

costs, valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred
    tax assets, liabilities for potential litigation, claims and
    assessments, and liabilities for environmental remediation,
    deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions and self-insurance.

We cannot assure you that our liabilities recorded for landfill
    and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the
    requirements of existing environmental regulations, future
    changes to or interpretations of existing regulations, or the
    identification of adverse environmental conditions previously
    unknown to us.

Changes
    in insurance markets may impact our financial results.

Due to the variable condition of the insurance market, we have
    experienced, and may continue to experience in the future,
    increased self-insurance retention levels and increased
    premiums. As we assume more risk for

self-insurance

through higher retention levels, we may experience more
    variability in our self-insurance reserves and expense.

We depend
    on key personnel.

Our future success depends on the continued contributions of
    several key employees and officers. We do not maintain key man
    life insurance policies on any of our officers. The loss of the
    services of key employees and officers, whether such loss is
    through resignation or other causes, or the inability to attract
    additional qualified personnel, could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
    growth prospects.

Seasonal
    changes or severe weather may adversely affect our business and
    operations.

Our operations may be adversely affected by periods of inclement
    or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste
    collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding
    compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste,
    reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or
    delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and
    other facilities.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

On March 26, 2007, Republic Services of Ohio II, LLC, an
    Ohio limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of
    our company, was issued Final Findings and Orders from the Ohio
    Environmental Protection Agency. The F&Os relate to
    environmental conditions attributed to a chemical reaction
    resulting from the disposal of certain aluminum production waste
    at the Countywide Recycling and Disposal facility in East
    Sparta, Ohio. The F&Os, and certain other remedial actions
    Republic-Ohio has agreed with the OEPA to undertake to address
    the environmental conditions, include, without limitation, the
    following actions: (a) prohibiting leachate recirculation,
    (b) refraining from the disposal of solid waste in certain
    portions of the site, (c) updating engineering plans and
    specifications and providing further information regarding the
    integrity of various engineered components at the site,
    (d) performing additional data collection, (e) taking
    additional measures to address emissions, (f) expanding the
    gas collection and control system, (g) installing a
    “fire” break, (h) removing liquids from gas
    extraction wells, and (i) submitting a plan to the OEPA to
    suppress the chemical reaction and, following approval by the
    OEPA, implementing such plan. We also paid approximately
    $.7 million in sanctions to comply with the F&Os.
    Currently, Republic-Ohio is performing certain interim remedial
    actions required by the OEPA, but the OEPA has not approved
    Republic-Ohio’s plan to suppress the chemical reaction.

Republic-Ohio has also received a request from the U.S. EPA
    to cooperate and address certain environmental conditions at
    Countywide. Republic-Ohio has indicated its willingness to
    cooperate with the U.S. EPA on these issues. Republic-Ohio
    is in the process of or has already substantially completed the
    activities identified in the U.S. EPA’s letter.

We learned that the Commissioner of the Stark County Health
    Department recommended that the Health Board suspend
    Countywide’s 2007 annual operating license. We also have
    learned that the Commissioner intends to recommend that the
    Health Board deny Countywide’s pending license application
    for 2008. Republic-Ohio obtained a preliminary injunction
    prohibiting the Health Board from suspending its 2007 operating
    license and has also obtained a Temporary Restraining Order
    prohibiting the Health Board from denying its 2008 operating
    license application.

We believe that we have diligently performed all actions
    required under the F&Os and that Countywide does not pose a
    threat to the environment. In addition, there are indications
    that the reaction is beginning to subside. As such, we believe
    that we satisfy the rules and regulations that govern the
    operating license at Countywide. We disagree with the
    Commissioner’s recommendation and will pursue all legal
    remedies available regarding licensing of the facility.

If we are not successful with such legal and administrative
    remedies, we will be required to close Countywide and record a
    non-cash charge of approximately $90 million for asset
    impairment and a charge of approximately $10 million for
    acceleration of future capping, closure and post-closure
    activities. In addition, we would forego future cash flows
    expected to be generated by Countywide and a portion of the cash
    flows from our Cleveland and Akron marketplaces. The annual
    projected future net cash flows are estimated to be
    approximately $16 million.

We intend to vigorously pursue financial contributions from
    third parties for our costs to comply with the F&Os, other
    required remedial actions and, if necessary, any costs related
    to the closing of Countywide.

We are and will continue to be involved in various
    administrative and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of
    business. We can give you no assurance regarding the outcome of
    these proceedings or the effect their outcomes may have, or that
    our insurance coverages or reserves are adequate. A significant
    judgment against our company, the loss of significant permits or
    licenses, or the imposition of a significant fine could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations, cash flows or prospects.

Governmental agencies have previously assessed, and we have
    paid, fines and penalties related primarily to environmental
    matters at our landfill operations. As of December 31,
    2007, we were involved in several matters in which we believe
    there is a reasonable possibility that sanctions could exceed
    $100,000. These matters involve allegations that we violated
    various federal and state regulations. We do not believe that
    any of these matters will, either individually or in the
    aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.

    Information, Holders and Dividends

Our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on
    July 1, 1998.

In January 2007, our board of directors approved a

3-for-2

stock split effective on March 16, 2007 for stockholders of
    record on March 5, 2007. Our share and per share data have
    been retroactively restated to reflect the split.

The following table sets forth the range of the high and low
    sale prices of our common stock and the cash dividends declared
    per share of common stock for the periods indicated:

On February 15, 2008 the last reported sale price of our
    common stock was $31.18.

There were approximately 91 record holders of our common stock
    at February 15, 2008, which does not include beneficial
    owners for whom Cede & Co. or others act as nominees.

In January 2008, our board of directors declared a regular
    quarterly dividend of $.17 per share for stockholders of record
    on April 1, 2008. We expect to continue to pay quarterly
    cash dividends, and we may consider increasing our quarterly
    cash dividends if we believe it will enhance shareholder value.

From 2000 through 2007, our board of directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $2.3 billion of our common stock. As of
    December 31, 2007, we paid $2.2 billion to repurchase
    74.8 million shares of our common stock, of which
    11.1 million shares were acquired during 2007 for
    $362.8 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had
    $136.4 million remaining under our share repurchase
    authorization. In January 2008, our board of directors
    authorized the repurchase of an additional $250.0 million
    of our common stock.

We have the ability under our credit facility to pay dividends
    and repurchase our common stock under the condition that we are
    in compliance with the covenants in our credit facility. As of
    December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the financial
    covenants of our credit facility.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our
    Consolidated Financial Statements and their Notes contained in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Overview
    of Our Business

We are a leading provider of non-hazardous solid waste
    collection and disposal services in the United States. We
    provide solid waste collection services for commercial,
    industrial, municipal and residential customers through 136
    collection companies in 21 states. We also own or operate
    94 transfer stations, 58 solid waste landfills and 33 recycling
    facilities.

We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection
    operations. Our remaining revenue is from other services
    including landfill disposal, recycling, compost, mulch and soil
    operations.

The following table reflects our revenue by source for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in millions):

Our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we
    receive from commercial, industrial, municipal and residential
    customers. Our residential and commercial collection operations
    in some markets are based on long-term contracts with
    municipalities. We generally provide industrial and commercial
    collection services to individual customers under contracts with
    terms up to three years. Our revenue from landfill operations is
    from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. In
    general, we integrate our recycling operations with our
    collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of
    recyclable materials. No one customer has individually accounted
    for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of our
    reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years.

The cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and
    includes disposal, labor, self-insurance, fuel and equipment
    maintenance costs. It also includes capital costs for equipment
    and facilities. We seek operating efficiencies by controlling
    the movement of waste from the point of collection through
    disposal. During the three months ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006, approximately 58% and 56%, respectively, of the total
    volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own
    or operate.

Our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of
    capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure
    and post-closure, and the legal and administrative costs of
    ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses
    include leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and
    groundwater monitoring and system maintenance, interim cap
    maintenance, and costs associated with the application of daily
    cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development
    costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the
    units-of-consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill
    costs related to cell development. In life cycle accounting,
    certain direct costs are capitalized, and charged to expense
    based on the consumption of cubic yards



of available airspace. These costs include all costs to acquire
    and construct a site including excavation, natural and synthetic
    liners, construction of leachate collection systems,
    installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems,
    installation of groundwater monitoring wells, and other costs
    associated with the acquisition and development of the site.
    Obligations associated with final capping, closure and
    post-closure are capitalized, and amortized on a
    units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed.

Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and
    accounting personnel to adjust our rates used to expense
    capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate
    to changes in costs, available airspace, inflation and
    applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include
    changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes
    due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we
    believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted.

Our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions
    that we designate as our reportable segments. From 2005 to 2007,
    revenue increased in all of our regions due to the successful
    execution of our pricing strategy.

2007 compared to 2006:

•

Revenue in our Eastern Region increased during 2007 compared to
    2006 due to price increases in all lines of business and an
    increase in the price of commodities. This increase in revenue
    was partially offset by lower volumes in the industrial
    collection line of business primarily due to less temporary
    work, and lower landfill volumes. These lower volumes resulted
    from less favorable weather conditions and a general slowdown in
    residential construction during 2007.

Operating margins in the Eastern Region decreased from 16.2% to
    11.5% primarily because of a $44.6 million charge to
    operating expenses and a $1.5 million charge to selling,
    general and administrative expenses associated with
    environmental conditions at our Countywide Recycling and
    Disposal Facility in East Sparta, Ohio. Excluding these
    expenses, operating margins increased from 16.2% in 2006 to
    19.4% in 2007, primarily due to higher revenue, lower disposal
    costs, and lower truck and equipment maintenance costs.

•

Revenue in our Central Region increased during 2007 compared to
    2006 due to price increases in all lines of business and an
    increase in the price of commodities. This increase in revenue
    was partially offset by lower volumes in the commercial
    collection, industrial collection and landfill lines of
    business. Lower volumes in the collection lines of business are
    primarily due to less favorable weather conditions during 2007
    and a general slowdown in economic conditions. Lower landfill
    volumes are primarily due to our decision to limit our
    acceptance of certain waste streams.

Operating margins in our Central Region increased due to higher
    revenue, lower disposal costs and adjustments to landfill
    amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. This
    increase in operating margins was partially offset by increases
    in risk insurance and landfill operating costs.

•

In our Southern Region, price increases in all lines of
    business, increases in the price of commodities, and increases
    in commercial collection, residential collection and landfill
    volumes resulted in an increase in revenue during 2007 compared
    to 2006. This increase in revenue was partially offset by lower
    industrial collection volumes. These lower volumes are primarily
    due to a general slowdown in residential construction in 2007,
    and hurricane-related work that was performed during 2006.

Operating margins in our Southern Region increased primarily due
    to higher revenue, lower disposal costs due to drier weather,
    lower truck and equipment maintenance costs, and lower labor
    costs.

•

Our Southwestern Region benefited from price increases in all
    lines of business and volume increases in the commercial
    collection, industrial collection and landfill lines of
    business. This increase in revenue was partially offset by a
    decrease in residential collection volumes. This decrease in
    residential collection volumes is primarily due to the city of
    Houston assuming responsibility for collecting municipal solid
    waste.

The increase in operating margins in our Southwestern Region is
    primarily due to higher revenue and lower selling, general and
    administrative costs. This increase in operating margins was
    partially offset by higher disposal and truck maintenance costs.

•

In our Western Region, price increases in all lines of business,
    volume increases in the residential collection line of business
    and an increase in commodity prices resulted in an increase in
    revenue during 2007 compared to 2006. This increase in revenue
    was partially offset by a decrease in industrial collection and
    landfill volumes resulting from a general slowdown in
    residential construction in 2007.

Operating margins in our Western Region decreased because of an
    $8.1 million increase in landfill operating costs and a
    $5.2 million increase in SFAS 143 amortization expense
    associated with environmental conditions at our closed disposal
    facility in Contra Costa County, California. Excluding these
    expenses, operating margins increased from 23.3% in 2006 to
    24.0% in 2007, primarily due to higher revenue and an increase
    in the price of commodities.



•

The decrease in operating costs for Corporate Entities from 2006
    to 2007 is due to a $4.3 million reduction to our allowance
    for doubtful accounts recorded during 2007 as a result of
    refining our estimate of our allowance based on our historical
    collection experience, which was partially offset by increases
    in operating costs associated with the expansion of our business.

2006 compared to 2005

:

•

Revenue in our Eastern Region increased during 2006 compared to
    2005 due to price increases in our collection and landfill lines
    of business and due to increased volumes in our industrial
    collection and landfill businesses. This increase in revenue was
    partially offset by decreased volume in our commercial and
    residential collection businesses and by the sale of our
    operations in western New York during the three months ended
    March 31, 2005. Operating margins decreased from 2005 to
    2006 due to higher landfill operating and fuel costs partially
    offset by higher revenue.

•

In our Central Region, revenue increased during 2006 compared to
    2005 due to price increases in our collection and landfill lines
    of business and volume growth in our landfill line of business
    arising from favorable economic conditions. Operating margins
    decreased primarily due to increased third-party hauling costs
    associated with our company assuming responsibility for hauling
    waste from the city of Toronto to one of our landfills in
    Michigan. This increase in costs was partially offset by
    adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with
    SFAS 143.

•

Our operations in the Southern Region experienced the greatest
    margin improvement of all of our segments because of price
    increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines
    of business. Operating margins increased because of an increase
    in revenue arising from favorable economic conditions, partially
    offset by higher fuel costs and adjustments to landfill
    amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. Operating
    margins also improved during 2006 because of higher costs
    incurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to hurricane

clean-up.

•

In our Southwestern Region, revenue increased due to price
    increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines
    of business, partially offset by the sale of our remediation and
    heavy construction services business during the fourth quarter
    of 2005. The increase in operating margins from 2005 to 2006 is
    attributable to an increase in revenue arising from improving
    economic conditions, partially offset by higher fuel costs and
    adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with
    SFAS 143.

•

In our Western Region, revenue increased due to price increases
    and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of
    business. Operating margins decreased from 2005 to 2006 because
    of higher fuel, labor and insurance costs, partially offset by
    an increase in revenue during 2006 and adjustments for landfill
    amortization expense associated with SFAS 143.

•

The increase in operating costs for Corporate Entities from 2005
    to 2006 is due to the expansion of our business, incremental
    costs associated with our adoption of SFAS 123(R),
    additional costs associated with our 401(k) plan resulting from
    an increase in the employer’s matching contribution
    percentage and an increase in other incentive compensation.

    Financial Objectives

In February 2007, we publicly announced our objectives for the
    year. These objectives included the following:

•

Generating free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) in excess of 100%
    of net income, or approximately $315 million. In July 2007,
    we increased our range of anticipated free cash flow to
    approximately $320 to $325 million.

•

Using our free cash flow to repurchase our common stock under
    our existing $250.0 million share repurchase program and to
    continue to pay quarterly cash dividends.

•

Generating diluted earnings per share of $1.50 to $1.52. We
    updated our earnings per share guidance in July 2007 to a new
    range of $1.59 to $1.62 per diluted share and in October 2007 to
    a new range of $1.65 to $1.66



per diluted share (excluding the $54.9 million of charges,
    or $.18 per diluted share, we recorded in 2007 related to our
    Countywide and Contra Costa County facilities).

•

Growing revenue from core operations by approximately 4.0% to
    4.5%, with approximately 3.0% to 3.5% attributable to price
    increases and 1% attributable to volume growth. In July 2007, we
    updated our core revenue growth guidance to approximately 3.0%,
    with approximately 4.5% attributable to price growth (excluding
    commodities), while volume was expected to decline approximately
    1.5%.

•

Purchasing approximately $310 million of property and
    equipment, net of sales of property and equipment. In July 2007,
    we reduced this to $295 million.

    Business Performance

During 2007, we met or exceeded our financial objectives.

During 2007, we generated free cash flow of $374.9 million
    (consisting of cash provided by operating activities of
    $661.3 million, less purchases of property and equipment of
    $292.5 million, plus proceeds from sales of property and
    equipment of $6.1 million).

In July 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase
    of an additional $250.0 million of our company stock.
    During 2007, we used our free cash flow to repurchase
    11.1 million shares of our common stock, or 5.7% of our
    outstanding shares, for $362.8 million. Also, during the
    third quarter of 2007, our board of directors increased our
    quarterly dividend to $.17 per share.

During 2007, we generated diluted earnings per share of $1.51.
    Excluding pre-tax charges of $54.9 million
    ($33.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, net of tax)
    related to our Countywide and Contra Costa County facilities and
    a pre-tax gain of $12.5 million ($5.0 million, or
    $0.03 per diluted share, net of tax) related to the sale of our
    compost, mulch and soil business in Texas, our diluted earnings
    per share would have been $1.66.

Our internal growth from core operations for 2007, excluding
    commodities, divestitures, taxes and non-core operations, was
    3.1%, with 4.6% from price increases offset by a 1.5% decline in
    volume. During 2007, our revenue growth from core pricing
    continued to benefit from a broad-based pricing initiative which
    we started during the fourth quarter of 2003. The broad-based
    price increases we secured offset various escalating capital and
    operating costs, including fuel costs. During 2007, we
    experienced lower industrial collection and landfill volumes
    primarily resulting from the slowdown in residential
    construction.

Excluding the $54.9 million of charges we recorded during
    2007 related to our Countywide and Contra Costa County
    facilities, our operating margins increased by 1.7% from 16.9%
    in 2006 to 18.6% in 2007. During 2007, improved pricing and
    continued focus on productivity improvements offset higher fuel
    and insurance costs.

    Financial Objectives

Our financial objectives for 2008 assume no deterioration or
    improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during
    the fourth quarter of 2007. Specific guidance is as follows:

•

We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income, or
    approximately $340 to $350 million.

•

We anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to repurchase
    shares of our common stock under our existing $250 million
    share repurchase program and a new $250.0 million
    repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in
    January 2008. We also anticipate using our free cash flow to
    continue to pay quarterly cash dividends.

•

We anticipate diluted earnings of $1.78 to $1.82 per share.

•

We anticipate operating margins of approximately 19.0%.



•

We are targeting internal growth from core operations to be
    approximately 2.0% to 3.5%, with approximately 3.5% to 4.0%
    attributable to core price increases, while the change in volume
    is expected to be down .5% to 1.5%.

•

We anticipate purchasing approximately $325 million of
    property and equipment, net of sales of property and equipment.

    Business Initiatives

Our business initiatives for 2008 are generally a continuation
    of those initiated in prior years and are dependent on further
    standardizing our business processes and improving our systems.
    Ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and
    processes and are trained on our systems is essential to the
    overall success of our initiatives. Our business initiatives for
    2008 are as follows:

•

Pricing initiatives.

During the fourth quarter
    of 2003, we implemented a broad-based pricing initiative across
    all lines of our business. The purpose of this initiative is to
    recover increasing costs and improve operating margins. We
    realized the benefit of this initiative during the past several
    years and expect a continuing benefit during 2008.

•

Improve business integration.

During 2005, we
    took a number of steps to further strengthen our business
    platform and improve our business integration. In response to
    limited vertical integration opportunities, we divested of our
    operations in western New York. We acquired a landfill in the
    Dallas/Fort Worth area which better integrated that
    marketplace. In addition, we divested of our remediation and
    heavy construction services business. During 2007, we divested
    of our Texas-based compost, mulch and soil business. We plan to
    continue to develop and implement strategies that improve the
    performance of locations and lines of business that are
    performing below the company’s average. To achieve this
    objective, we may purchase operations from, sell operations to
    or exchange operations with other companies in the future.

•

Improve the quality of our revenue.

During
    2006, we completed the development of the next generation of our
    billing and operating system. This system standardizes our
    billing and operating processes. It also provides a variety of
    functionalities including customer service, dispatch, billing,
    sales analysis, account retention and route productivity
    analysis. During 2008, we will continue to ensure that our
    operating personnel are utilizing the system to its full
    potential.

We currently monitor our return on investment by marketplace and
    use a return on investment pricing model. This model will
    eventually allow us to track our return on investment by
    customer.

We use a customer relationship management system. This system
    improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to
    establish marketing priorities and track sales leads. It also
    tracks renewal periods for potential commercial, industrial and
    franchise contracts. During 2008, we will continue to ensure our
    sales force is properly trained on this system and is using it
    as intended.

•

Improve the productivity of our operations.

We
    use a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the
    performance of our drivers. In addition, in our larger markets,
    we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and
    improve operational density. During 2008, we will continue to
    update our disposal optimization metrics. These metrics identify
    which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested
    capital and cash flow.

•

Improve fleet management and procurement.

We
    use Dossier as our fleet management and parts procurement system
    at all of our significant hauling and landfill operations. Among
    other features, this system tracks parts inventories, generates
    automatic quantity order points and logs all maintenance work.
    It allows us to capture and review information to ensure our
    preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers’
    warranties and governmental regulations. In addition, the
    purchase order module within this system allows us to
    cross-reference purchasing information with our inventory.
    During 2008, we intend to further utilize this purchase order
    module to take advantage of volume discounts.

Enhance operational and financial reporting
    systems.

We have several initiatives aimed at
    improving our operational and financial reporting systems. The
    overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed



information, prepared in a consistent manner, that will allow us
    to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business.

One of our most significant systems is our enterprise-wide
    general ledger package, which includes Lawson general ledger
    software and Lawson fixed asset software.

During December 2006, we successfully converted all of our
    locations to Lawson enterprise-wide human resources software.
    This software provides a number of direct benefits including a
    reduction in payroll processing and compliance costs and
    integration into our general ledger software. It also provides a
    number of indirect benefits including better information
    concerning labor and related costs and better control over
    employee-related initiatives such as training.

All of the system initiatives mentioned above provide us with
    more consistent and detailed information, thus allowing us to
    make quicker and more informed business decisions. In addition,
    all of our significant software applications are standardized
    and centralized at our data center in Fort Lauderdale,
    Florida. This standardization and centralization provides us
    with consolidated information concerning our operations across a
    variety of operational and financial disciplines. It also
    significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster
    recovery plan.

•

Expand our safety training programs.

In light
    of increasing insurance costs and as part of our ongoing
    emphasis on safe work practices, we continue to expand our
    safety training programs. Safety will continue to be a key area
    of focus during 2008.

•

“Customer First” program.

In order
    to secure our position as a leading provider of world-class
    customer service, we have initiated a “Customer First”
    program. Several of our divisions were selected to implement
    this program during 2008. This program entails establishing
    sustainable and competitive service standards in each applicable
    marketplace. Systems to measure our success in meeting our
    service level standards will also be developed. Best practices
    derived from the program will be implemented throughout our
    company.



Critical
    Accounting Policies, Judgments and Disclosures

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and
    necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by
    management. The following is a list of accounting policies that
    we believe are the most critical in understanding our
    company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows, and may require management to make subjective or
    complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain:

Landfill Accounting:

Life Cycle Accounting

We use life cycle accounting and the units-of-consumption method
    to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the site.
    In life cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and construct a
    site are capitalized, and charged to expense based on the
    consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. Obligations
    associated with final capping, closure and post-closure are
    capitalized, and amortized on a units-of-consumption basis as
    airspace is consumed.

Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers. Changes in these estimates could significantly affect
    our amortization, depletion and accretion expense.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Landfill and Environmental Matters.

Note 3, Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Probable Expansion Airspace

We include expansion areas that we believe have a probable
    likelihood that the expansion area will ultimately be permitted
    in our calculation of total available airspace.

We have developed six criteria that must be met before an
    expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace. We
    believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a
    high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in
    our landfill costing will be permitted. However, because some of
    these criteria are judgmental, they may exclude expansion
    airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion
    airspace that will not be permitted. In either of these
    scenarios, our amortization, depletion and accretion expense
    could change significantly.

Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure

We account for our final capping, closure and post-closure
    activities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations.” Under SFAS 143, obligations associated
    with final capping activities that occur during the operating
    life of the landfill are recognized on a units-of-consumption
    basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping
    event. Obligations related to closure and post-closure
    activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations
    are recognized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is
    consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill. Landfill
    retirement obligations are capitalized as the related
    liabilities are recognized and amortized using the
    units-of-consumption method over the airspace consumed within
    the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire
    landfill, depending on the nature of the obligation. All
    obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value. Fair
    value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation
    rate and the company’s credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in
    effect at the time the liabilities were incurred.

Future costs for final capping, closure and post-closure are
    developed at least annually by engineers, and are inflated to
    future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation
    rate projections. Changes in any of these estimates could affect
    our amortization of final capping, closure and post-closure
    costs and our accretion expense.

Self-Insurance:

Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. Self-insurance accruals
    are based on claims reported and actuarial estimates of claims
    development and claims incurred but not reported.

Estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not
    reported are developed actuarially. If actual claims experience
    or development is significantly different than our estimates,
    our self-insurance expense would change.

Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Property and Equipment:

Expenditures for Improvements, Repairs and Maintenance

Expenditures for major additions and improvements to facilities
    are capitalized. All expenditures for maintenance and repairs
    are expensed when incurred.

Whether certain expenditures improve an asset or lengthen its
    useful life is subject to our judgment. Accordingly, the actual
    useful lives of our assets could differ from our estimates.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Property and Equipment.

Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

Accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts,
    represents their estimated net realizable value. Provisions for
    doubtful accounts are recorded based on historical collection
    experience, the age of the receivables, specific customer
    information and economic conditions. In general, reserves are
    provided for accounts receivable in excess of 90 days old.
    Accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed
    uncollectible.

Establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and
    the overall adequacy of our accounts receivable reserve is a
    matter of judgment. If our judgments and estimates concerning
    the adequacy of our reserve for accounts receivable is
    incorrect, bad debt expense would change.

Income Taxes:

Deferred Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting
    for Income Taxes.” Accordingly, deferred taxes have been
    provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the
    recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax
    reporting purposes and between the tax bases of assets and
    liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
    statements. After the initial recognition of a deferred tax
    asset, a valuation allowance is provided if it is determined
    that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be
    realized.

Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the
    realizability of net operating losses for tax purposes are based
    on our judgment. If our judgments and estimates concerning
    valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating
    losses are incorrect, our provision for income taxes would
    change.

Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6,
    Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of
    FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” The interpretation identifies
    a defined methodology for recognizing uncertain tax positions.

Evaluating and estimating our uncertain tax positions and tax
    benefits is based on our judgment. If our judgments and
    estimates are incorrect, our provision for income taxes would
    change.

Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6,
    Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business
    Combinations

We make decisions to acquire, invest in or divest of businesses
    based on financial and strategic considerations. Businesses
    acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of
    accounting and are included in our Consolidated Financial
    Statements from the date of acquisition.

We acquired various solid waste businesses during the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The aggregate
    purchase price we paid for these transactions was
    $4.4 million, $4.9 million and $26.7 million,
    respectively. In addition, during 2005, we entered into a
    $53.9 million capital lease related to a landfill.

In November 2007, we divested of our Texas-based compost, mulch
    and soil business and received proceeds of $36.5 million. A
    gain of $12.5 million was recorded in 2007 on this
    divestiture. In 2005, we divested of our operations in western
    New York and received proceeds of $29.1 million. A gain of
    $3.3 million was recorded in



2005 on the divestiture. In addition, in 2005, we sold our
    environmental remediation company and received proceeds of
    $1.2 million. A loss of $2.0 million was recorded in
    2005 on the divestiture.

Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill)
    for 2007 acquisitions totaled $1.0 million. As of
    December 31, 2007 we had goodwill, net of accumulated
    amortization, of $1,555.7 million.

Goodwill for 2006 acquisitions totaled $1.0 million. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had goodwill, net of accumulated
    amortization, of $1,562.9 million.

Goodwill for 2005 acquisitions totaled $16.6 million. As of
    December 31, 2005, we had goodwill, net of accumulated
    amortization, of $1,563.8 million. $57.9 million of
    the total purchase price paid for acquisitions (including the
    landfill capital lease) and contingent payments to former owners
    was allocated to landfill airspace during 2005.

When a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets,
    purchase price is allocated to airspace based on the discounted
    expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other
    assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other
    landfill assets and liabilities acquired (which are primarily
    for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations).
    Landfill purchase price is amortized using the
    units-of-consumption method over total available airspace, which
    includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate.

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Years
    Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

Our net income was $290.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, or $1.51 per diluted share, as compared
    to $279.6 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, in 2006 and
    $253.7 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in 2005.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded
    pre-tax charges of $45.3 million ($27.9 million, or
    $.15 per diluted share, net of tax) related to estimated costs
    that we believe are required to comply with Final Findings and
    Orders issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in
    response to environmental conditions at our Countywide Recycling
    and Disposal Facility in East Sparta, Ohio and to undertake
    certain other remedial actions we have agreed with the OEPA to
    perform, including, without limitation, installing a
    “fire” break and removing liquids from gas extraction
    wells. While we intend to vigorously pursue financial
    contributions from third parties for our costs to comply with
    the F&Os and the additional remedial actions, we have not
    recorded any receivables for potential recoveries.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a
    pre-tax charge of $9.6 million ($5.9 million, or $.03
    per diluted share, net of tax) associated with an increase in
    estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite
    equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed
    disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. These
    additional costs are attributable to a consent agreement with
    the California Department of Toxic Substance Control.

The charges for our Countywide and Contra Costa County
    facilities affected our Consolidated Statements of Income as

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a net
    tax benefit of $4.8 million in our provision for income
    taxes related to the resolution of various tax matters,
    including the effective completion of Internal Revenue Service
    audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001
    through 2004. Income tax expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 includes a $5.1 million benefit
    related to the resolution of various income tax matters,
    including the effective completion of Internal Revenue Service
    audits for the years 1998 through 2000.

We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,”
    effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective
    transition method. As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R), we
    recorded $6.3 million and $5.5 million of incremental
    equity-based compensation expense during the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In accordance
    with the modified prospective transition method, our
    Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not
    been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of
    adopting SFAS 123(R). See Note 8, Employee Benefit
    Plans, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for

2007:

During the year ended December 31,
    2007, our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit
    from a broad-based pricing initiative which we started during
    the fourth quarter of 2003. Our revenue growth also benefited
    from higher prices for commodities. However, we experienced a
    decrease in core volume growth primarily due to lower industrial
    collection and landfill volumes resulting from the slowdown in
    residential construction.

•

2006:

During the year ended December 31,
    2006, our revenue growth continued to benefit from our
    broad-based pricing initiative. We experienced core volume
    growth in our collection and landfill lines of business. This
    core volume growth was partially offset by hurricane

clean-up

efforts that took place during the fourth quarter of 2005.

•

2005:

During the year ended December 31,
    2005, our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit
    from our broad-based pricing initiative. During the year ended
    December 31, 2005, we experienced core volume growth in our
    residential collection, industrial collection and landfill
    businesses. Our core volume growth was also positively impacted
    by hurricane

clean-up

efforts. In June 2005, we began assessing environmental fees on
    the non-franchise portion of our customer base.

•

2008 Outlook:

We anticipate internal growth
    from core operations to be approximately 2.0% to 3.5% during
    2008, with approximately 3.5% to 4.0% attributable to core price
    increases, while the change in volume is expected to be down .5%
    to 1.5%. Our projections assume no deterioration or improvement
    in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth
    quarter of 2007. However, our internal growth may remain flat or
    may decline in 2008 depending on economic conditions and our
    success in implementing pricing initiatives.

Cost of Operations.

Cost of operations was
    $1,997.3 million, $1,924.4 million and
    $1,803.9 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 62.9%,
    62.7% and 63.0%, for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

The increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006
    period is primarily a result of the $41.0 million of
    charges we have recorded in cost of operations related to
    estimated costs to comply with Final Findings and Orders issued
    by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and to undertake
    certain other remedial actions in response to environmental
    conditions at our Countywide facility and the $8.1 million
    charge we recorded related to an increase in leachate disposal
    costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and
    treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa
    County, California. The increase in aggregate dollars for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005
    period is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations
    through internal growth.

The following table summarizes the major components of our cost
    of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our

A description of our cost categories is as follows:

•

Subcontractor, disposal and third-party fees include costs such
    as third-party disposal, transportation of waste, host fees and
    cost of goods sold. The decrease in such expenses as a
    percentage of revenue for all periods presented is primarily due
    to higher revenue resulting from improved pricing. During 2007,
    drier weather, particularly in our Southern Region, resulted in
    lower disposal costs. In addition, the decrease in expense as a
    percentage of revenue from 2005 to 2006 is due to costs incurred
    during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to hurricane

clean-up.

These reductions in costs were partially offset by additional
    third-party hauling costs incurred during 2006 associated with
    our company assuming responsibility for hauling waste from the
    city of Toronto to one of our landfills in Michigan.

•

Labor and benefits include costs such as wages, salaries,
    payroll taxes and health benefits for our frontline service
    employees and their supervisors. The increase in such expenses
    as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31,
    2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is due to increases in
    benefits including health insurance. In addition, during
    December 2006, we assumed responsibility for hauling a portion
    of our transfer station volumes to one of our landfills. This
    hauling service reduced our third-party fees and increased
    various other cost categories, the most significant of which is
    labor. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable
    2005 period is primarily due to higher revenue resulting from
    improved pricing and productivity improvements in our commercial
    and industrial collection lines of business.

•

Maintenance and operating includes costs such as fuel, parts,
    shop labor and benefits, third-party repairs, and landfill
    monitoring and operating. The increase in such expenses as a
    percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007
    versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to an
    increase in landfill operating costs resulting from
    $41.0 million of charges recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 for our Countywide facility. These
    charges related to increases in estimated costs to comply with
    Final Findings and Orders issued by the Ohio Environmental
    Protection Agency and to undertake certain other remedial
    actions in response to environmental conditions. In addition,
    landfill operating costs increased due to an $8.1 million
    charge associated with an increase in estimated leachate
    disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that
    captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in
    Contra Costa County, California. The increase in such expenses
    as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31,
    2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is primarily due to
    increases in fuel and landfill operating costs. The cost of fuel
    as a percentage of revenue increased by .3% from 2006 to 2007
    and by .6% from 2005 to 2006.

•

Insurance and other includes costs such as workers’
    compensation, auto and general liability insurance, property
    taxes, property maintenance and utilities. The increase in such
    expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is
    primarily due to an increase in the severity of our automobile
    insurance claims.

The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and
    may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by
    other companies. As such, care should be taken when comparing
    our cost of operations by cost component to that of other
    companies.

Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and
    Equipment.

Depreciation, amortization and
    depletion expenses for property and equipment were
    $299.0 million, $289.0 million and
    $271.7 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 9.4%, 9.4%
    and 9.5%, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. The increase in such expenses in aggregate
    dollars for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the
    comparable 2006 period is partially due to $3.3 million of
    adjustments to landfill amortization expense for changes in
    estimates and assumptions related to our reviews of landfill
    asset retirement obligations under SFAS 143. In addition,
    during the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred
    approximately $3.3 million of additional depletion and
    amortization expense associated with a reduction of estimated
    remaining available airspace at our Countywide facility.
    Depreciation expense during 2007 was also slightly higher due to
    our ongoing truck and equipment replacement program. The slight
    decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the
    year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005
    period is due to lower landfill amortization and depletion
    expense during 2006.



Amortization of Intangible Assets.

Intangible
    assets consist primarily of costs in excess of fair value of net
    assets acquired (goodwill), but also includes values assigned to
    long-term contracts, covenants not to compete and customer
    relationships. Expenses for amortization of intangible assets
    were $6.5 million, $7.0 million and $7.1 million,
    or, as a percentage of revenue, .2% for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Accretion Expense.

Accretion expense was
    $17.1 million, $15.7 million and $14.5 million,
    or, as a percentage of revenue, .5% for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    increases in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2007 and 2006
    is primarily due to increases in asset retirement obligations.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses were $320.3 million, $315.0 million and
    $289.5 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 10.1%,
    10.3% and 10.1%, for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in such expenses in
    aggregate dollars for the year ended December 31, 2007
    versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to the
    expansion of our business. The decrease in such expenses as a
    percentage of revenue for 2007 versus 2006 is primarily due to a
    reduction in incentive compensation costs and a
    $4.3 million reduction to our allowance for doubtful
    accounts recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007
    as a result of refining our estimate for our allowance based on
    our historical collection experience.

The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a
    percentage of revenue from 2005 to 2006 is due to incremental
    costs associated with our adoption of SFAS 123(R),
    additional costs associated with our 401(k) plan resulting from
    an increase in the employer’s matching contribution
    percentage and an increase in other incentive compensation.
    During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we
    incurred $6.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively,
    of incremental costs associated with our adoption of
    SFAS 123(R).

We believe that selling, general and administrative expenses for
    2008 will be approximately 10.0% to 10.5% of revenue.

Operating Income.

Operating income was
    $536.0 million, $519.5 million and
    $477.2 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 16.9%,
    16.9% and 16.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

Interest Expense.

We incurred interest expense
    primarily on our unsecured notes and tax-exempt bonds. Interest
    expense was $94.8 million, $95.8 million and
    $81.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest expense
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable
    2005 period is primarily due to an increase in debt balances and
    an increase in interest rates on our floating-rate debt.

Capitalized interest was $3.0 million, $2.7 million
    and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Interest Income and Other Income (Expense),
    Net.

Interest income and other income, net of
    other expense, was $26.9 million, $20.0 million and
    $13.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable
    2006 period is due to a $12.5 million gain related to the
    sale of our compost, mulch and soil business in Texas partially
    offset by lower interest income on cash and restricted cash
    balances. The increase in aggregate dollars for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is
    primarily due to an increase in interest income on cash and
    restricted cash balances resulting from higher interest rates.

Income Taxes.

Our provision for income taxes
    was $177.9 million, $164.1 million and
    $155.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was
    38.0%, 37.0% and 38.0% for the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, we recorded a net tax benefit of
    $4.8 million in our provision for income taxes related to
    the resolution of various income tax matters, including the
    effective completion of Internal Revenue Service audits of our
    consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004.
    Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006
    includes a $5.1 million benefit related to the resolution
    of various income tax matters, including the effective



completion of Internal Revenue Service audits for the years 1998
    through 2000. We believe that our effective income tax rate for
    2008 will be approximately 38.5%.

Changes in engineering estimates typically include minor
    modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill
    based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting
    from updated information. Changes in design typically include
    significant modifications to a landfill’s footprint or
    vertical slopes.

At December 31, 2004, 12.7% of our total available
    airspace, or 222.2 million cubic yards, consisted of
    probable expansion airspace at twelve of our landfills. At
    December 31, 2007, 11.1% of our total available airspace,
    or 192.0 million cubic yards, consisted of probable
    expansion airspace at eleven of our landfills. Between



December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2007, we received
    permits for five of our probable expansions, which demonstrates
    our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion
    airspace.

During 2007, total available airspace increased by a
    net 7.5 million cubic yards due to new expansions
    undertaken, changes in engineering estimates and permits
    granted, partially offset by airspace consumed and changes in
    design. In addition, during the year ended December 31,
    2007, total available airspace was increased as a result of
    obtaining a new contract to operate a landfill in Texas, which
    was substantially offset by a reduction resulting from not
    renewing a contract to operate a small landfill in Texas.
    Changes in design in 2007 are primarily due to a reduction of
    estimated remaining available airspace at our Countywide
    facility. During 2006, total available airspace decreased by
    33.6 million cubic yards due to airspace consumption,
    partially offset by permits granted and changes in engineering
    estimates. During 2005, total available airspace increased by
    3.6 million cubic yards primarily due to new expansions
    undertaken, the acquisition of a landfill, permits granted and
    changes in engineering estimates, partially offset by airspace
    consumed.

As of December 31, 2007, we owned or operated 58 solid
    waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated
    to be 1.7 billion in-place cubic yards. Total available
    disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted
    airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. These
    estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing
    information provided by annual aerial surveys. As of
    December 31, 2007, total available disposal capacity is
    estimated to be 1.5 billion in-place cubic yards of
    permitted airspace plus .2 billion in-place cubic yards of
    probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included in an
    expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace
    and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available
    disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion criteria.
    See Note 3, Landfill and Environmental Costs, of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

As of December 31, 2007, eleven of our landfills meet all
    of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace
    in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual
    volumes, these eleven landfills have an estimated remaining
    average site life of 30 years, including probable expansion
    airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our
    landfills is 27 years. Probable expansion airspace
    represents 11.1% of our total available airspace. We have other
    expansion opportunities that are not included in our total
    available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria
    for probable expansion airspace.

The following table reflects the estimated operating lives of
    our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity
    using current annual volumes as of December 31, 2007:

Sites with expansion airspace include two landfills with less

Final
    Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

As of December 31, 2007, accrued final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs were $277.7 million. The current portion
    of these costs of $32.6 million is reflected in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current liabilities. The
    long-term portion of these costs of $245.1 million is
    reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accrued landfill
    and environmental costs.

Remediation
    and Other Charges for Landfill Matters

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded
    pre-tax charges of $45.3 million related to estimated costs
    to comply with Final Findings and Orders issued by the Ohio
    Environmental Protection Agency and to



undertake certain other remedial actions in response to
    environmental conditions at our Countywide facility. We have
    complied with and will continue to comply with the F&Os. We
    also recorded $3.3 million of additional depletion and
    amortization expense during the year ended December 31,
    2007 associated with a reduction of estimated remaining
    available airspace at this landfill as a result of the
    OEPA’s F&Os. While we intend to vigorously pursue
    financial contributions from third parties for our costs to
    comply with the F&Os and the additional remedial actions,
    we have not recorded any receivables for potential recoveries.

Also during the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a
    charge of $9.6 million associated with an increase in
    estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite
    equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed
    disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. These
    additional costs are attributable to a consent agreement with
    the California Department of Toxic Substance Control.

We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities
    through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. We accrue costs
    related to environmental remediation activities associated with
    acquisitions of properties through business combinations as a
    charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or
    landfill purchase price allocated to airspace, as appropriate.

The increase in depletion, amortization and accretion expense
    per cubic yard of airspace consumed from 2006 to 2007 is
    partially due to an increase of $3.3 million in landfill
    amortization expense that we recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 related to reviews of landfill asset
    retirement obligations at our landfills. This increase is also
    partially due to $3.3 million of additional depletion and
    amortization expense we have recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 associated with a reduction of estimated
    remaining available airspace at our Countywide facility.

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    our weighted-average compaction rate was approximately 1,500
    pounds per cubic yard based on our three-year historical moving
    average. Our compaction rates may improve as a result of the
    settlement and decomposition of waste.

As of December 31, 2007, we expect to spend an estimated
    additional $1.7 billion on existing landfills, primarily
    related to cell construction and environmental structures, over
    their expected remaining lives. Our total expected investment,
    excluding non-depletable land, estimated to be
    $2.6 billion, or $1.50 per cubic yard, is used in
    determining our depletion and amortization expense based on
    airspace consumed using the units-of-consumption method.

Financial
    Condition

At December 31, 2007 we had $21.8 million of cash and
    cash equivalents. We also had $165.0 million of restricted
    cash deposits, including $71.4 million of restricted cash
    held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities.

In June 2005, we entered into a $750.0 million unsecured
    revolving credit facility with a group of banks which was
    scheduled to expire in 2010. This facility replaced our prior
    facilities which aggregated $750.0 million. In April



2007, we increased our unsecured revolving credit facility to
    $1.0 billion and extended the term to 2012. Borrowings
    under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR-based rates. We
    use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit
    facilities to finance our working capital, capital expenditures,
    acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends and other
    requirements. As of December 31, 2007, we had
    $538.6 million available under our credit facility.

In May 1999, we sold $375.0 million of unsecured notes in
    the public market. These notes bear interest at 7.125% per annum
    and mature in 2009. Interest on these notes is payable
    semi-annually in May and November. The notes were offered at a
    discount of $.5 million. In March 2005, we exchanged
    $275.7 million of our outstanding 7.125% notes due
    2009 for new notes due 2035. The new notes bear interest at
    6.086%. We paid a premium of $27.6 million related to the
    exchange. This premium is being amortized over the life of the
    new notes using the effective yield method.

In August 2001, we sold $450.0 million of unsecured notes
    in the public market. The notes bear interest at 6.75% and
    mature in 2011. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually
    in February and August. The notes were offered at a discount of
    $2.6 million.

In order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest
    rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest
    rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with
    investment grade-rated financial institutions. Our outstanding
    swap agreements have a total notional value of
    $210.0 million and require our company to pay interest at
    floating rates based on changes in LIBOR and receive interest at
    a fixed rate of 6.75%. Our swap agreements mature in August 2011.

At December 31, 2007, we had $731.9 million of
    tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings outstanding of
    which $58.5 million were obtained during fiscal 2007.
    Borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest
    based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing
    market ranging from 3.25% to 5.63% at December 31, 2007 and
    have maturities ranging from 2012 to 2037. As of
    December 31, 2007, we had $71.4 million of restricted
    cash related to proceeds from tax-exempt bonds and other
    tax-exempt financings. This restricted cash will be used to fund
    capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements.

In March 2005, we entered into a $53.9 million capital
    lease related to a landfill.

We believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities
    and proceeds from our revolving credit facility provide us with
    sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital
    requirements and obligations as they come due. We believe that
    we will be able to raise additional debt or equity financing, if
    necessary.

Our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of
    revenue for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was .1%, .3% and .2%,
    respectively. The reduction in the allowance for doubtful
    accounts during the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the
    comparable periods presented is due to an adjustment we recorded
    in 2007 of $4.3 million as a result of refining our
    estimate for our allowance based on our historical collection
    experience. As of December 31, 2007, accounts receivable
    were $298.2 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts
    of $14.7 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of
    34, or 20 days net of deferred revenue. At
    December 31, 2007, our accounts receivable in excess of
    90 days old totaled $19.5 million, or 6.2% of gross
    receivables outstanding.

Our expense for self-insurance, which includes risk insurance
    and health insurance for all of our employees, as a percentage
    of revenue for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 5.9%, 5.4% and 5.6%,
    respectively. The increase in self-insurance expense for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006
    period is primarily due to an increase in the severity of our
    automobile insurance claims. The decrease in self-insurance
    expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the
    comparable 2005 period is due to favorable claims development.
    We believe that, during 2008, our self-insurance expense will be
    in the range of 5.5% to 6.0% of revenue.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The major components of changes in cash flows for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are discussed below.

Cash Flows From Operating Activities.

Cash
    provided by operating activities was $661.3 million,
    $511.2 million and $747.8 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The changes
    in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are
    primarily due to the expansion of our business, the timing of
    payments received for accounts receivable, and the timing of
    payments made for accounts payable. Additionally, during the
    year ended December 31, 2006, we paid approximately
    $83.0 million in income taxes related to fiscal 2005. This
    tax payment had been deferred as a result of an Internal Revenue
    Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina.

We use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures,
    acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments and debt
    repayments.

Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities.

Cash
    used in investing activities was $260.3 million,
    $204.5 million and $277.5 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and
    consists primarily of cash used for capital additions for all
    periods presented, cash provided by a decrease in restricted
    cash in 2006, cash provided by a decrease in restricted
    marketable securities in 2005, cash provided by the disposition
    of our compost, mulch and soil business in Texas in 2007, and
    cash provided by the disposition of our operations in western
    New York in 2005. Capital additions were $292.5 million,
    $326.7 million and $309.0 million during the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash
    used to acquire businesses, net of cash acquired, was
    $4.4 million, $4.9 million and $26.7 million
    during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions
    through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital
    expenditures, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit
    facility, tax-exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to
    use primarily cash for future business acquisitions.

Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities.

Cash
    used in financing activities was $408.3 million,
    $409.4 million and $480.0 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and
    consists primarily of purchases of common stock for treasury,
    proceeds from and payments of notes payable and long-term debt,
    proceeds from issuances of common stock due to stock option
    exercises and payments of cash dividends. Purchases of common
    stock for treasury were $362.8 million, $492.0 million
    and $558.4 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Dividends paid were $93.9 million,
    $78.5 million and $72.2 million during 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

From 2000 through 2007, our board of directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $2.3 billion of our common stock. As of
    December 31, 2007, we paid $2.2 billion to repurchase
    74.8 million shares of our common stock, of which
    $362.8 million was paid during 2007 to repurchase
    11.1 million shares of our common stock.

In January 2007, our board of directors approved a

3-for-2

stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effective on
    March 16, 2007, to stockholders of record as of
    March 5, 2007. We distributed approximately
    64.5 million shares from treasury stock to effect the stock
    split.

We used proceeds from our cash on hand, liquidation of
    marketable securities, cash flows from operations, and issuances
    of tax-exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and
    acquisitions and to repay debt. We intend to finance



future stock repurchases and dividend payments through cash on
    hand, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facility
    and other financings.

Credit
    Rating

Our company has received investment grade credit ratings. As of
    December 31, 2007, our senior debt was rated BBB+ by
    Standard & Poor’s, BBB+ by Fitch and Baa1 by
    Moody’s.

Fuel
    Hedges

During November 2007, we entered into an option agreement
    related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
    (“SFAS 133”), the option qualified for and was
    designated as an effective hedge of changes in the prices of
    forecasted diesel fuel purchases. This option agreement
    commences on January 5, 2009 and settles each month in
    equal notional amounts of 60,000 gallons through
    December 31, 2013. In accordance with SFAS 133, the
    effective portion of the change in fair value as of
    December 31, 2007, net of tax, has been recorded in
    stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the change in
    fair value was not material and has been recorded in other
    income (expense), net in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

During January 2007, we entered into option agreements related
    to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under SFAS 133, the
    options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges in
    the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases. These option
    agreements commence on January 1, 2008 and will settle each
    month in equal notional amounts of 500,000 gallons through
    December 2010. In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective
    portion of the change in fair value as of December 31,
    2007, net of tax, has been recorded in stockholders’ equity
    as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The
    ineffective portion of the change in fair value was not material
    and was included in other income (expense), net in the
    accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

During September 2006, we entered into option agreements related
    to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under SFAS 133, the
    options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges in
    the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases. These option
    agreements commenced on October 2, 2006 and settled each
    month in equal notional amounts of 500,000 gallons through
    December 31, 2007. In accordance with SFAS 133, the
    effective portion of the change in fair value as of
    December 31, 2006, net of tax, has been recorded in
    stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the change in
    fair value was not material and has been recorded in other
    income (expense), net in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

During October 2005, we entered into option agreements related
    to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under SFAS 133, the
    options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges in
    the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases. The option
    agreements commenced on January 1, 2006 and settled each
    month in equal notional amounts through December 31, 2006.
    In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portion of the
    change in fair value as of December 31, 2005, net of tax,
    has been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion
    of the change in fair value was not material and has been
    recorded in other income (expense), net in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

During March 2005, we entered into option agreements related to
    forecasted diesel fuel purchases. The option agreements settled
    each month in equal notional amounts through December 31,
    2005. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value was
    not material and was included in other income (expense), net in
    the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

In addition to the above, we have unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2007 of $23.2 million of which we expect
    to settle approximately $.6 million within the following
    twelve months. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing
    of future cash flows associated with the remainder of the
    unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007, we are
    unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of
    any cash settlements.

We also have letters of credit totaling $669.1 million
    outstanding at December 31, 2007.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We do not have or engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements.



Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying
    value, since interest rates are variable and, thus, approximate
    current market rates.

Free Cash
    Flow

We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles, as cash provided by operating activities less
    purchases of property and equipment, plus proceeds from sales of
    property and equipment as presented in our Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows. Our free cash flow for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is calculated as follows
    (in millions):

Years Ended December 31,

$

$

$

448.9

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2007 was
    higher than anticipated due to lower than expected purchases of
    property and equipment, higher deferred income taxes and lower
    payments for asset retirement obligations.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
    negatively affected by an $83.0 million federal tax payment
    that had been deferred until February 2006 as a result of an
    Internal Revenue Service notice issued in response to Hurricane
    Katrina.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
    higher than the other years presented primarily because of a
    $113.4 million federal tax payment that was deferred.
    During February 2006, we paid $83.0 million of these
    deferred payments.

Purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and as presented in the
    free cash flow above represent amounts paid during the period
    for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and
    equipment reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
    to property



and equipment received during the period for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows (in
    millions):

Years Ended December 31,

    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

$

337.6

$

328.7

The adjustments noted above do not affect either our net change
    in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows or our free cash flow.

We believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides
    useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by
    operating activities after expenditures for property and
    equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment.
    It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial
    strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets
    to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital
    assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services
    provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our
    existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock
    at prices that provide value to our stockholders, paying cash
    dividends, maintaining our investment grade rating and
    minimizing debt. In addition, free cash flow is a key metric
    used to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash
    flow has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent
    our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because
    it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we
    have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend
    payments. Our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable
    to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Seasonality
    and Severe Weather

Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement
    or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste
    collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding
    compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste,
    reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or
    delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and
    other facilities.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”),
    which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS 157 will be effective beginning
    January 1, 2008. We do not believe that the adoption of
    SFAS 157 will have a material impact on our financial
    statements.

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued Statement of Financial Standards No. 159, “The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”), which permits
    companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value. This statement also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. SFAS 159 will be effective for our company
    beginning January 1, 2008. At the effective date, a company
    may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at
    that date. The company would report the initial effect of any
    remeasurement to fair value as a cumulative effect adjustment to
    the opening balance of retained earnings for the fiscal year in
    which this statement is initially applied. Upfront costs and
    fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected
    would be recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred.
    Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
    fair value option has been elected would be reported in
    earnings. We do not believe that SFAS 159 will have a
    material impact on our financial statements.

There are no other new accounting pronouncements that are
    significant to us.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Republic Services,
    Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Republic Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Republic Services, Inc. and subsidiaries
    at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
    in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes.” Additionally, effective January 1, 2006, the
    Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Republic Services, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Republic Services,
    Inc.:

We have audited Republic Services, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Republic Services,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of
    Management on Republic Services, Inc.’s Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Republic Services, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Republic Services, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
    equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 of
    Republic Services, Inc. and our report dated February 20,
    2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the
    accounts of Republic Services, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and
    its subsidiaries (the “Company”). The Company is a
    leading provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection and
    disposal services in the United States. All intercompany
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes” (“FIN 48”), which is an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting
    for Income Taxes,” effective January 1, 2007. As a
    result of adopting the provisions of FIN 48, the Company
    recorded a $5.6 million cumulative adjustment to decrease
    beginning retained earnings in the first quarter of 2007. In
    accordance with the transition requirements of FIN 48,
    results of prior periods have not been restated. (For further
    information, see Note 6, Income Taxes.)

The following table summarizes the balance sheet impact of
    adopting FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007:

In January 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
    a

3-for-2

stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effective on
    March 16, 2007, to stockholders of record as of
    March 5, 2007. The Company’s shares, per share data
    and weighted average common and common equivalent shares
    outstanding have been retroactively adjusted for all periods to
    reflect the stock split.

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123(R)”), effective January 1, 2006,
    using the modified prospective transition method. As a result of
    adopting SFAS 123(R), the Company recorded
    $6.3 million and $5.5 million of incremental
    equity-based compensation expense for stock options and
    restricted stock during the years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. In accordance with the modified
    prospective transition method, the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect,
    and do not include, the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R).
    (For further information, see Note 2, Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Employee
    Benefit Plans.)

Certain amounts in the 2006 and 2005 Consolidated Financial
    Statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2007
    presentation.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Estimates
    and Assumptions

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles and necessarily include amounts based on estimates
    and assumptions made by management. Actual results could differ
    from these amounts. Significant items subject to such estimates
    and assumptions primarily include the depletion and amortization
    of landfill development costs, liabilities for final capping,
    closure and post-closure costs, valuation allowances for
    accounts receivable and deferred tax assets, liabilities for
    potential

litigation, claims and assessments, and liabilities for
    environmental remediation, deferred taxes, uncertain tax
    positions and self-insurance.

Accounts
    Receivable

Accounts receivable represent receivables from customers for
    collection, transfer, disposal and other services. Receivables
    are recorded when billed. Accounts receivable, net of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts, represents their estimated net
    realizable value. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded
    based on historical collection experience, the age of the
    receivables, specific customer information and economic
    conditions. In 2007, the Company recorded a $4.3 million
    reduction in its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of
    the Company refining its estimate of its allowance based on its
    historical collection experience. In general, reserves are
    provided for accounts receivable in excess of ninety days old.
    Accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed
    uncollectible.

Prepaid
    Expenses and Other Current Assets

Inventories consist primarily of equipment parts, fuel, and, at
    December 31, 2006, compost, mulch, and soil materials, that
    are valued under a method that approximates the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out) or market. During 2007, the Company divested of its
    Texas-based compost, mulch and soil business.

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.

Property
    and Equipment

Purchases of property and equipment for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $292.5 million,
    $326.7 million and $309.0 million, respectively.
    Purchases of property and equipment as presented in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows represent amounts paid
    during the period for such expenditures. A

Capital expenditures included in accounts payable are
    $53.2 million, $50.0 million and $39.1 million at
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for
    major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized,
    while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
    incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the
    related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
    accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company revises the estimated useful lives of property and
    equipment acquired through business acquisitions to conform with
    its policies regarding property and equipment. Depreciation is
    provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets involved
    using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives are
    seven to forty years for buildings and improvements, five to
    twelve years for vehicles, seven to ten years for most landfill
    equipment, three to fifteen years for all other equipment, and
    five to twelve years for furniture and fixtures.

Landfill development costs are stated at cost and are amortized
    or depleted based on consumed airspace. Landfill development
    costs include direct costs incurred to obtain landfill permits
    and direct costs incurred to acquire, construct and develop
    sites as well as final capping, closure and post-closure assets
    accrued in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations” (“SFAS 143”). These costs are
    amortized or depleted based on consumed airspace. All indirect
    landfill development costs are expensed as incurred. (For
    further information, see Note 3, Landfill and Environmental
    Costs.)

The Company capitalizes interest on landfill cell construction
    and other construction projects in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, “Capitalization
    of Interest Cost.” Construction projects must meet the
    following criteria before interest is capitalized:

1. Total construction costs are $50,000 or greater,

2. The construction phase is one month or longer, and

3. The assets have a useful life of one year or longer.

Interest is capitalized on qualified assets while they undergo
    activities to ready them for their intended use. Capitalization
    of interest ceases once an asset is placed into service or if
    construction activity is suspended for more than a brief period
    of time. The interest capitalization rate is based upon the
    Company’s weighted average cost of indebtedness. Interest
    capitalized was $3.0 million, $2.7 million and
    $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company periodically evaluates whether events and
    circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the
    estimated useful life of property and equipment or whether the
    remaining balance of property and equipment should be evaluated
    for possible impairment. The following are examples of such
    events or changes in circumstances:

•

A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset
    or asset group,

•

A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a
    long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical
    condition,

•

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
    climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset or
    asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a
    regulator,

•

An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
    originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a
    long-lived asset or asset group,

•

A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a
    history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or
    forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the
    use of a long-lived asset or asset group, or

•

A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived
    asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of
    significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
    life.

There are certain indicators listed above that require
    significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry
    when applied to landfill development or expansion. For example,
    a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit
    application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted.
    In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one
    landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill
    airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary
    course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators
    of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry.

If indicators of impairment exist, the Company uses an estimate
    of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life
    of the property and equipment in assessing their recoverability.
    If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to
    recover the carrying value of the property and equipment, the
    Company measures impairment loss as the amount by which the
    carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist of the cost of acquired businesses in
    excess of the fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) and
    other intangible assets. Other intangible assets include values
    assigned to customer relationships, long-term contracts and
    covenants not to compete and are amortized generally over
    periods ranging from 6 to 10 years.

Goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis.
    In testing for impairment, the Company estimates the fair value
    of each operating segment and compares the fair value with the
    carrying value. If the fair value of an operating segment is
    greater than its carrying value, then no impairment results. If
    the fair value is less than its carrying value, then the Company
    would determine the fair value of the goodwill. The fair value
    of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of an
    operating segment’s identifiable assets and liabilities
    from the fair value of the operating segment as a whole, as if
    that operating segment had just been acquired and the purchase
    price were being initially allocated. If the fair value of the
    goodwill were less than its carrying value for a segment, an
    impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in the
    Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income.

In addition, the Company would evaluate an operating segment for
    impairment if events or circumstances change between annual
    tests indicating a possible impairment. Examples of such events
    or circumstances include the following:

•

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
    climate,

•

An adverse action or assessment by a regulator,

•

A more likely than not expectation that a segment or a
    significant portion thereof will be sold, or

•

The testing for recoverability under Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,” of a significant asset
    group within the segment.

The Company did not record an impairment charge as a result of
    its goodwill impairment test in 2007. However, there can be no
    assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the
    future.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
    (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123(R)”). This Statement requires
    companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options
    and similar equity instruments issued to employees over the
    requisite service periods. SFAS 123(R) eliminates the
    alternative to use the intrinsic method of accounting provided
    for in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB
    25”), which generally resulted in no compensation expense
    being recorded in the financial statements related to grants of
    stock options to employees if certain conditions were met. The
    pro forma impact from recognition of the estimated fair value of
    stock options granted to employees has historically been
    disclosed in the Company’s footnotes as required under
    previous accounting rules.

Effective for the first quarter of 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition
    method, which requires recognition of compensation expense for
    all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the
    unvested portion of previously granted awards that remained
    outstanding at the date of adoption. Prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123(R), the Company accelerated the vesting of all of
    its outstanding stock options previously awarded to employees as
    approved by the Company’s Board of Directors effective
    December 30, 2005. Consequently, no compensation expense
    will be recognized under SFAS 123(R) for these options.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), all tax benefits
    resulting from the exercise of stock options were reported as
    cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows. SFAS 123(R) requires that cash
    flows resulting from tax benefits related to tax deductions in
    excess of those recorded for compensation expense (either on a
    pro forma or an actual basis) be classified as cash flows from
    financing activities. As a result, the Company classified
    $6.0 million and $13.8 million of its excess tax
    benefits as cash flows from financing activities for the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. All other
    tax benefits related to stock options have been presented as a
    component of cash flows from operating activities.

The fair value concepts for valuing equity-based compensation
    were not changed significantly in SFAS 123(R); however, in
    adopting this Statement, companies were required to choose among
    alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions. After
    assessing alternative valuation models and amortization
    assumptions, the Company changed its method of valuation for
    options granted beginning in fiscal 2006 to a lattice binomial
    option-pricing model from the Black-Scholes valuation model
    previously used for calculating the Company’s pro forma
    information under SFAS 123. The Company recognizes
    compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period for each separately vesting portion of the award,
    or to the employee’s retirement-eligible date, if earlier.

The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options
    granted during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006
    was $6.49 and $6.21 per option, respectively, and was calculated
    using the following weighted-average assumptions:

effect at the time of the grant for instruments with a similar
    life. The dividend yield reflects the Company’s dividend
    yield at the date of grant. The expected life represents the
    period that the stock options are expected to be outstanding,
    taking into consideration the contractual term of the options
    and the Company’s employees’ historical exercise and
    post-vesting employment termination behavior, weighted to
    reflect the job level demographic profile of the employees
    receiving the option grants. The estimated forfeiture rate is
    based on historical forfeitures and is adjusted periodically
    based on actual results.

As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R), the charge to income
    from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for
    the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 for stock

Revenue
    Recognition and Deferred Revenue

The Company generally provides services under contracts with
    municipalities or individual customers. Revenue consists
    primarily of collection fees from commercial, industrial,
    residential and municipal customers and transfer and landfill
    disposal fees charged to third parties. Advance billings are
    recorded as deferred revenue, and the revenue is then recognized
    over the period services are provided. Collection, transfer and
    disposal, and other services accounted for 75.9%, 18.3% and
    5.8%, respectively, of consolidated revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. No one customer has individually
    accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated
    revenue or of the Company’s reportable segment revenue in
    any of the past three years.

The Company recognizes revenue when all four of the following
    criteria are met:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists such as a service
    agreement with a municipality, a hauling customer or a disposal
    customer,

•

Services have been performed such as the collection and hauling
    of waste or the disposal of waste at a Company-owned or operated
    disposal facility,

•

The price of the services provided to the customer is fixed or
    determinable, and

•

Collectibility is reasonably assured.

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS 109. Accordingly, deferred income taxes have been
    provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the
    recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax
    reporting purposes and between the tax bases of assets and
    liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
    statements.

The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it
    believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In
    making such determination, the Company considers all available
    positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of
    deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax
    planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the
    event the Company determines that it would be able to realize
    its deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their
    net recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the
    valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income
    taxes.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the
    provisions of FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial
    statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48
    provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may
    be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position
    will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any
    related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical
    merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not
    recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized
    upon the adoption of FIN 48 and in subsequent periods. This
    interpretation also provides guidance on measurement,
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes
    in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Accrued
    interest and penalties are included within other current
    liabilities and deferred income taxes and other long-term tax
    liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Statements
    of Cash Flows

The Company considers all unrestricted highly liquid investments
    with purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents. The effect of non-cash transactions related to
    business combinations, as discussed in

Note 4, Business Combinations, and other non-cash
    transactions are excluded from the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted
    cash and marketable securities, receivables, accounts payable
    and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short
    maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the
    Company’s fixed rate unsecured notes and tax-exempt
    financing using quoted market rates is $1,131.9 million and
    $1,104.4 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The carrying value of the fixed rate unsecured
    notes and tax-exempt financing is $1,072.7 million and
    $1,091.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The carrying amounts of the Company’s
    remaining notes payable and tax-exempt financing approximate
    fair value because interest rates are variable and, accordingly,
    approximate current market rates.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company provides services to commercial, industrial,
    municipal and residential customers in the United States.
    Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables
    are limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in
    which services are provided as well as their dispersion across
    many geographic areas in the United States. The Company performs
    ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, but does not
    require collateral to support customer receivables. The Company
    establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on various
    factors including the credit risk of specific customers, age of
    receivables outstanding, historical trends, economic conditions
    and other information.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”),
    which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS 157 will be effective beginning
    January 1, 2008. The Company does not believe the adoption
    of SFAS 157 will have a material impact on its Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued Statement of Financial Standards No. 159, “The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”), which permits
    companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value. This statement also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. SFAS 159 will be effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2008. At the effective date, a company
    may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at
    that date. The Company would report the initial effect of any
    remeasurement to fair value as a cumulative effect adjustment to
    the opening balance of retained earnings for the fiscal year in
    which this statement is initially applied. Upfront costs and
    fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected
    would be recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred.
    Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
    fair value option has been elected would be reported in
    earnings. The Company does not believe that SFAS 159 will
    have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

There are no other new accounting pronouncements that are
    significant to the Company.

Related
    Party Transactions

It is the Company’s policy that transactions with related
    parties must be on terms that, on the whole, are no less
    favorable than those that would be available from unaffiliated
    parties.

Life
    Cycle Accounting

The Company uses life cycle accounting and the
    units-of-consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs
    over the life of the site. In life cycle accounting, all costs
    to acquire and construct a site are capitalized, and charged to
    expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available
    airspace. Costs and airspace estimates are developed at least
    annually by engineers. These estimates are used by the
    Company’s operating and accounting personnel to adjust the
    Company’s rates used to expense capitalized costs. Changes
    in these estimates primarily relate to changes in available
    airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in
    available airspace include changes due to the addition of
    airspace lying in probable expansion areas.

Total
    Available Disposal Capacity

As of December 31, 2007, the Company owned or operated 58
    solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity of
    approximately 1.7 billion in-place cubic yards. Total
    available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated
    permitted airspace plus an estimate of expansion airspace that
    the Company believes has a probable likelihood of being
    permitted.

Probable
    Expansion Airspace

Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined as
    probable expansion airspace and, therefore, is included in the
    Company’s calculation of total available disposal capacity,
    the following criteria must be met:

1.

The land associated with the expansion airspace is either owned
    by the Company or is controlled by the Company pursuant to an
    option agreement;

2.

The Company is committed to supporting the expansion project
    financially and with appropriate resources;

3.

There are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated
    with the project, including political impediments;

4.

Progress is being made on the project;

5.

The expansion is attainable within a reasonable time
    frame; and

6. The Company believes it is likely the expansion permit
    will be received.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All
    tables in millions, except per share
    data) — (Continued)

Upon meeting the Company’s expansion criteria, the rates
    used at each applicable landfill to expense costs to acquire,
    construct, cap, close and maintain a site during the
    post-closure period are adjusted to include probable expansion
    airspace and all additional costs to be capitalized or accrued
    associated with the expansion airspace.

The Company has identified three steps that landfills generally
    follow to obtain expansion permits. These steps are as follows:

1. Obtaining approval from local authorities;

2. Submitting a permit application to state
    authorities; and

3. Obtaining permit approval from state authorities.

Once a landfill meets the Company’s expansion criteria,
    management continuously monitors each site’s progress in
    obtaining the expansion permit. If at any point it is determined
    that an expansion area no longer meets the required criteria,
    the probable expansion airspace is removed from the
    landfill’s total available capacity and the rates used at
    the landfill to expense costs to acquire, construct, cap, close
    and maintain a site during the post-closure period are adjusted
    accordingly.

Capitalized
    Landfill Costs

Capitalized landfill costs include expenditures for land,
    permitting costs, cell construction costs and environmental
    structures. Capitalized permitting and cell construction costs
    are limited to direct costs relating to these activities,
    including legal, engineering and construction costs associated
    with excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of
    leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas
    collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater
    monitoring wells and other costs associated with the development
    of the site. Interest is capitalized on landfill construction
    projects while the assets are undergoing activities to ready
    them for their intended use. Capitalized landfill costs also
    include final capping, closure and post-closure assets accrued
    in accordance with SFAS 143 as discussed below.

Costs related to acquiring land, excluding the estimated
    residual value of unpermitted, non-buffer land, and costs
    related to permitting and cell construction are depleted as
    airspace is consumed using the units-of-consumption method.

Capitalized landfill costs may also include an allocation of
    purchase price paid for landfills. For landfills purchased as
    part of a group of assets, the purchase price assigned to the
    landfill is determined based on the discounted expected future
    cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within
    the acquired group. If the landfill meets the Company’s
    expansion criteria, the purchase price is further allocated
    between permitted airspace and expansion airspace based on the
    ratio of permitted versus probable expansion airspace to total
    available airspace. Landfill purchase price is amortized using
    the units-of-consumption method over the total available
    airspace including probable expansion airspace where appropriate.

Final
    Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

The Company accounts for final capping, closure and post-closure
    in accordance with SFAS 143.

The Company has future obligations for final capping, closure
    and post-closure costs with respect to the landfills it owns or
    operates as set forth in applicable landfill permits. Final
    capping, closure and post-closure costs include estimated costs
    to be incurred for final capping and closure of landfills and
    estimated costs for providing required post-closure monitoring
    and maintenance of landfills. The permit requirements are based
    on the Subtitle C and Subtitle D regulations of the Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), as implemented
    and applied on a

state-by-state

basis. Obligations associated with monitoring and controlling
    methane gas migration and emissions are set forth in applicable
    landfill permits and these requirements are based on the
    provisions of the Clean



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All
    tables in millions, except per share
    data) — (Continued)

Air Act of 1970, as amended. Final capping typically includes
    installing flexible membrane and geosynthetic clay liners,
    drainage and compact soil layers, and topsoil, and is
    constructed over an area of the landfill where total airspace
    capacity has been consumed and waste disposal operations have
    ceased. These final capping activities occur as needed
    throughout the operating life of a landfill. Other closure
    activities and post-closure activities occur after the entire
    landfill ceases to accept waste and closes. These activities
    involve methane gas control, leachate management and groundwater
    monitoring, surface water monitoring and control, and other
    operational and maintenance activities that occur after the site
    ceases to accept waste. The post-closure period generally runs
    for up to 30 years after final site closure for municipal
    solid waste landfills and a shorter period for construction and
    demolition landfills and inert landfills.

Estimates of future expenditures for final capping, closure and
    post-closure are developed at least annually by engineers. These
    estimates are reviewed by management and are used by the
    Company’s operating and accounting personnel to adjust the
    rates used to capitalize and amortize these costs. These
    estimates involve projections of costs that will be incurred
    during the remaining life of the landfill for final capping
    activities, after the landfill ceases operations and during the
    legally required post-closure monitoring period. Additionally,
    the Company currently retains post-closure responsibility for
    several closed landfills.

Under SFAS 143, a liability for an asset retirement
    obligation must be recognized in the period in which it is
    incurred and should be initially measured at fair value. Absent
    quoted market prices, the estimate of fair value should be based
    on the best available information, including the results of
    present value techniques in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Concepts No. 7, “Using Cash Flow
    and Present Value in Accounting Measurements” (“SFAC
    7”). The offset to the liability must be capitalized as
    part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.
    Changes in the liabilities due to the passage of time are
    recognized as operating items in the income statement and are
    referred to as accretion expense. Changes in the liabilities due
    to revisions to estimated future cash flows are recognized by
    increasing or decreasing the liabilities with the offsets
    adjusting the carrying amounts of the related long-lived assets,
    and may also require immediate adjustments to amortization
    expense in the income statement.

In applying the provisions of SFAS 143, the Company has
    concluded that a landfill’s asset retirement obligation
    includes estimates of all costs related to final capping,
    closure and post-closure. Costs associated with a
    landfill’s daily maintenance activities during the
    operating life of the landfill, such as leachate disposal,
    groundwater and gas monitoring, and other pollution control
    activities, are charged to expense as incurred. In addition,
    costs historically accounted for as capital expenditures during
    the operating life of a landfill, such as cell development
    costs, are capitalized when incurred, and charged to expense
    using life cycle accounting and the units-of-consumption method
    based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace.

The Company defines final capping as activities required to
    permanently cover a portion of a landfill that has been
    completely filled with waste. Final capping occurs in phases as
    needed throughout the operating life of a landfill as specific
    areas are filled to capacity and the final elevation for that
    specific area is reached in accordance with the provisions of
    the operating permit. The Company considers final capping events
    to be discrete activities that are recognized as asset
    retirement obligations separately from other closure and
    post-closure obligations. These capping events generally occur
    during the operating life of a landfill and can be associated
    with waste actually placed under an area to be capped. As a
    result, the Company uses a separate rate per ton for recognizing
    the principal amount of the liability and related asset
    associated with each capping event. The Company amortizes the
    asset recorded pursuant to this approach as waste volume
    equivalent to the capacity covered by the capping event is
    placed into the landfill based on the consumption of cubic yards
    of available airspace covered by the capping event.

The Company recognizes asset retirement obligations and the
    related amortization expense for closure and post-closure
    (excluding obligations for final capping) using the
    units-of-consumption method over the total remaining capacity of
    the landfill. The total remaining capacity includes probable
    expansion airspace.



REPUBLIC

(All

    data) — (Continued)

In general, the Company engages third parties to perform most of
    its final capping, closure and post-closure activities.
    Accordingly, the fair market value of these obligations is based
    on quoted and actual prices paid for similar work. The Company
    does intend to perform some of its final capping, closure and
    post-closure obligations using internal resources. Where
    internal resources are expected to be used to fulfill an asset
    retirement obligation, the Company has added a profit margin
    onto the estimated cost of such services to better reflect their
    fair market value as required by SFAS 143. These services
    primarily relate to managing construction activities during
    final capping, and maintenance activities during closure and
    post-closure. If the Company does perform these services
    internally, the added profit margin would be recognized as a
    component of operating income in the period the obligation is
    settled.

SFAC 7 states that an estimate of fair value should include
    the price that marketplace participants are able to receive for
    bearing the uncertainties in cash flows. However, when utilizing
    discounted cash flow techniques, reliable estimates of market
    premiums may not be obtainable. In this situation, SFAC 7
    indicates that it is not necessary to consider a market risk
    premium in the determination of expected cash flows. While the
    cost of asset retirement obligations associated with final
    capping, closure and post-closure can be quantified and
    estimated, there is not an active market that can be utilized to
    determine the fair value of these activities. In the case of the
    waste industry, no market exists for selling the responsibility
    for final capping, closure and post-closure independent of
    selling the landfill in its entirety. Accordingly, the Company
    believes that it is not possible to develop a methodology to
    reliably estimate a market risk premium and has excluded a
    market risk premium from its determination of expected cash flow
    for landfill asset retirement obligations in accordance with
    SFAC 7.

The Company’s estimates of costs to discharge asset
    retirement obligations for landfills are developed in
    today’s dollars. These costs are inflated each year to
    reflect a normal escalation of prices up to the year they are
    expected to be paid. The Company uses a 2.5% inflation rate,
    which is based on the ten-year historical moving average
    increase of the U.S. Consumer Price Index, and is the rate
    used by most waste industry participants.

These estimated costs are then discounted to their present value
    using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. The Company’s
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate for liability recognition was
    determined to be 6.5% and 6.4% for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, based on the
    estimated all-in yield the Company believes it would need to
    offer to sell thirty-year debt in the public market. Changes in
    asset retirement obligations due to the passage of time are
    measured by recognizing accretion expense in a manner that
    results in a constant effective interest rate being applied to
    the average carrying amount of the liability. The effective
    interest rate used to calculate accretion expense is the
    Company’s credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect at the
    time the liabilities were recorded.

In accordance with SFAS 143, changes due to revision of the
    estimates of the amount or timing of the original undiscounted
    cash flows used to record a liability are recognized by
    increasing or decreasing the carrying amount of the asset
    retirement obligation liability and the carrying amount of the
    related asset. Upward revisions in the amount of undiscounted
    estimated cash flows used to record a liability must be
    discounted using the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect
    at the time of the change. Downward revisions in the amount of
    undiscounted estimated cash flows used to record a liability
    must be discounted using the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate
    that existed when the original liability was recognized.

The Company reviews its calculations with respect to landfill
    asset retirement obligations at least annually. If there is a
    significant change in the facts and circumstances related to a
    landfill during the year, the Company will review its
    calculations for the landfill as soon as practical after the
    significant change has occurred. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the Company reviewed its landfill
    retirement obligations for its landfills and recorded a net
    increase of $3.3 million in amortization expense primarily
    related to changes in estimates and assumptions concerning the
    cost and timing of future final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities. During the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company completed its
    reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations and recorded
    reductions of $2.3 million and $3.8 million in
    amortization expense primarily related to changes in

Remediation

The Company accrues for remediation costs when they become
    probable and reasonably estimable. These estimates do not take
    into account discounts for the present value of total estimated
    costs. Management believes that the amounts accrued for
    remediation costs are adequate. However, a significant increase
    in the estimated costs for remediation could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    recorded pre-tax charges of $45.3 million
    ($27.9 million, or $.15 per diluted share, net of tax)
    related to estimated costs to comply with Final Findings and
    Orders (“F&Os”) issued by the Ohio Environmental
    Protection Agency (“OEPA”) in response to
    environmental conditions at the Company’s Countywide
    Recycling and Disposal Facility (“Countrywide”) in
    East Sparta, Ohio and to undertake certain other remedial
    actions that the Company has agreed with the OEPA to perform,
    including, without limitation, installing a “fire”
    break and removing liquids from gas extraction wells. While the
    Company intends to vigorously pursue financial contributions
    from third parties for its costs to comply with the F&Os
    and the additional remedial actions, the Company has not
    recorded any receivables for potential recoveries.

Also during 2007, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of
    $9.6 million ($5.9 million, or $.03 per diluted share,
    net of tax) associated with an increase in estimated leachate
    disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that
    captures and treats leachate at the Company’s closed
    disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. These
    additional costs are attributable to a consent agreement with
    the California Department of Toxic Substance Control.

The majority of these additional costs will be paid during
    fiscal 2008. It is reasonably possible that the Company will
    need to adjust the charges noted above to reflect the effects of
    new or additional information, to the extent that such
    information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the
    required actions. Future changes in the Company’s estimates
    of the costs, timing or duration of the required actions could
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

No other significant amounts were charged to income for
    remediation costs during the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005.

The expected future payments for remediation costs as of
    December 31, 2007 are as follows:

Environmental
    Operating Costs

In the normal course of business, the Company incurs various
    operating costs associated with environmental compliance. These
    costs include, among other things, leachate treatment and
    disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and systems
    maintenance, interim cap maintenance, costs associated with the
    application of daily cover materials, and the legal and
    administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance.

BUSINESS
    COMBINATIONS

The Company acquires businesses as part of its growth strategy.
    Businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method
    of accounting and are included in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates
    the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and the
    liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair values thereof.
    These estimates are revised during the allocation period as
    necessary if, and when, information regarding contingencies
    becomes available to further define and quantify assets

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

acquired and liabilities assumed. To the extent contingencies
    such as preacquisition environmental matters, litigation and
    related legal fees are resolved or settled during the allocation
    period, such items are included in the revised allocation of the
    purchase price. After the allocation period, the effect of
    changes in such contingencies is included in results of
    operations in the periods in which the adjustments are
    determined. The Company does not believe potential differences
    between its fair value estimates and actual fair values are
    material.

The Company acquired various solid waste businesses during the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The aggregate
    purchase price paid for these transactions was
    $4.4 million, $4.9 million and $26.7 million,
    respectively. In addition, during the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the Company entered into a
    $53.9 million capital lease related to a landfill.

During 2005, $57.9 million of the total purchase price paid
    for acquisitions (including the landfill capital lease) and
    contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill
    airspace.

For landfills purchased as part of a group of assets, the
    allocations of purchase price are based on the discounted
    expected future cash flow of each landfill relative to other
    assets within the acquired group and are adjusted for other
    landfill assets and liabilities acquired (primarily final
    capping, closure and post-closure obligations). Landfill
    purchase price is amortized using the units-of-consumption
    method over total available airspace, which includes probable
    expansion airspace where appropriate, and is included in
    property and equipment, net in the accompanying Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

    allocations for business combinations accounted for under the

In November 2007, the Company divested of its Texas-based

    $36.5 million. A gain of $12.5 million was recorded in
    2007 on this divesture. In March 2005, the Company divested of
    its operations in western New York and received proceeds of
    $29.1 million. The Company recorded a gain of
    $3.3 million in 2005 on the divestiture. In November 2005,
    the Company sold its environmental remediation business and
    received proceeds of $1.2 million. The Company recorded a
    loss of $2.0 million in 2005 on the divestiture.

In June 2005, the Company entered into a $750.0 million
    unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which
    was scheduled to expire in 2010. This facility replaced the
    Company’s prior facilities which aggregated
    $750.0 million. In April 2007, the Company increased its
    unsecured revolving credit facility to $1.0 billion and
    extended the term to 2012. As of December 31, 2007, the
    Company had $461.4 million of letters of



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All
    tables in millions, except per share
    data) — (Continued)

credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility, leaving
    $538.6 million of availability under the facility. The
    unsecured revolving credit facility requires the Company to
    maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain
    financial covenants. The Company has the ability under its
    credit facility to pay dividends and repurchase its common stock
    under the condition that it is in compliance with the covenants.
    At December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with
    the financial covenants of its credit facility.

Approximately two-thirds of the Company’s tax-exempt bonds
    and other tax-exempt financings are remarketed weekly by a
    remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. If
    the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the
    bonds can be put back to the Company. These bonds have been
    classified as long-term because they are supported by letters of
    credit issued under the Company’s long-term revolving
    credit facility or due to the Company’s ability and intent
    to refinance these bonds using availability under its revolving
    credit facility, if necessary.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had
    $165.0 million of restricted cash, of which
    $71.4 million were proceeds from the issuance of tax-exempt
    bonds and other tax-exempt financing and will be used to fund
    capital expenditures. Restricted cash also includes amounts held
    in trust as a financial guarantee of the Company’s
    performance.

Interest paid was $95.2 million, $95.4 million and
    $78.1 million (net of capitalized interest of
    $3.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.0 million) for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

During March 2005, the Company exchanged $275.7 million of
    its outstanding 7.125% notes due 2009 for new notes due
    2035. The new notes bear interest at 6.086%. The Company paid a
    premium of $27.6 million in connection with the exchange.
    This premium is being amortized over the life of the new notes
    using the effective yield method.

Other debt includes a capital lease liability of
    $35.4 million and $36.2 million as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to a
    landfill that the Company began operating in May 2005.

The Company’s ability to obtain financing through the
    capital markets is a key component of its financial strategy.
    Historically, the Company has managed risk associated with
    executing this strategy, particularly as it relates to
    fluctuations in interest rates, by using a combination of fixed
    and floating rate debt. The Company also entered into interest
    rate swap agreements to manage risk associated with fluctuations
    in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating
    interest rates. The swap agreements have a total notional value
    of $210.0 million and mature in August 2011. This maturity
    is identical to the Company’s public notes that also mature
    in 2011. Under the swap agreements, the Company pays interest at
    floating rates based on changes in LIBOR and receives interest
    at fixed rates of 6.75%. The Company has designated these
    agreements as hedges in changes in the fair value of the
    Company’s fixed-rate debt and accounts for them in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”). The
    Company has determined that these agreements qualify for the
    short-cut method under SFAS 133 and, therefore, changes in
    the fair value of the agreements are assumed to be perfectly
    effective in hedging changes in the fair value of the
    Company’s fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates.

As of December 31, 2007, interest rate swap agreements are
    reflected at fair market value of $3.1 million and are
    included in other assets and as an adjustment to long-term debt
    in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    recorded net interest expense of $2.3 million and
    $2.3 million and net interest income of $1.1 million,
    respectively, related to its interest rate swap agreements,
    which is included in interest expense in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had available unused
    state net operating loss carryforwards in varying amounts in
    various states. Deferred income taxes of approximately
    $27.5 million reflect the tax effect of the state net
    operating losses. The Company is required to file on a separate
    entity basis in certain states and the net operating losses have
    been generated in those states by entities that have
    historically generated taxable losses. These entities’
    cumulative losses create uncertainty about the utilization of
    the tax benefits in future years. Accordingly, the



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All
    tables in millions, except per share
    data) — (Continued)

Company has offset this deferred tax asset with a full valuation
    allowance. If the state net operating losses are not utilized,
    they begin to expire in varying amounts, starting in 2015. In
    assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
    considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
    or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized after the
    initial recognition of the deferred tax asset. The Company
    provides valuation allowances, as needed, to offset portions of
    deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future
    realization of such deferred tax assets. The Company adjusts the
    valuation allowance in the period management determines it is
    more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not
    be realized.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    recorded a net tax benefit of $4.8 million in its provision
    for income taxes related to the resolution of various tax
    matters, including the effective completion of the Internal
    Revenue Service audits of the Company’s consolidated tax
    returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. Income tax expense
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes a
    $5.1 million benefit related to the resolution of various
    income tax matters, including the effective completion of
    Internal Revenue Service audits for the years 1998 through 2000.

The Company made income tax payments (net of refunds received)
    of approximately $151.9 million, $198.8 million and
    $9.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately $83.0 million of
    income taxes paid during the year ended December 31, 2006
    related to fiscal 2005. This $83.0 million payment had been
    deferred as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice
    issued in response to Hurricane Katrina.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48 which clarifies the
    accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum
    recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before
    being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification,
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and
    transition, and requires expanded disclosure with respect to the
    uncertainty in income taxes. The Company adopted the provisions
    of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The cumulative
    effect of the adoption of the recognition and measurement
    provisions of FIN 48 resulted in a $5.6 million
    reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained
    earnings.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross
    unrecognized tax benefits for 2007 is as follows:

    approximately $7.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits
    (net of the federal benefit on state issues) that, if
    recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate in future
    periods.

The Company’s policy for interest and penalties under
    FIN 48 related to income tax exposures was not impacted as
    a result of the adoption and measurement provisions of
    FIN 48. The Company continues to recognize interest and
    penalties as incurred within the provision for income taxes in
    the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31,
    2007, the Company has a liability recorded of $5.5 million
    for interest and penalties, which is included as a component of
    the liabilities for uncertain tax positions. Substantially all
    of the balance recorded is for interest. To the extent interest
    and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax
    positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a
    reduction of the overall income tax provision.

During 2007, the Internal Revenue Service and management agreed
    to certain adjustments related to examined tax returns that will
    not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    position or results of operations. Gross unrecognized tax
    benefits that the Company expects to settle in the following
    twelve months are approximately $.6 million. The Company
    believes that it is reasonably possible that an increase of up
    to $2.4 million in unrecognized tax benefits related to
    state exposures may be recorded in the following twelve months.

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to
    U.S. federal income tax as well as to income tax in
    multiple state jurisdictions. The Company has effectively
    settled all U.S. federal income tax matters for years
    through 2004. With few exceptions, all significant state and
    local income tax matters have been effectively settled for years
    through 2000. All years subsequent to these closed periods
    remain open and subject to examination in the previously
    mentioned jurisdictions.

Management believes that the tax liabilities recorded are
    adequate. However, a significant assessment against the Company
    in excess of liabilities recorded could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

During 2000 through 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $2.3 billion of the Company’s
    common stock. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had paid
    $2.2 billion to repurchase 74.8 million shares of its
    common stock, of which 11.1 million shares were acquired
    during the year ended December 31, 2007 for
    $362.8 million. In January 2008, the Company’s Board
    of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional
    $250.0 million of the Company’s common stock.

In January 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
    a

3-for-2

stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effective on
    March 16, 2007, to stockholders of record as of
    March 5, 2007. The Company distributed 64.5 million
    shares from treasury stock to effect the stock split. In
    connection therewith, the Company transferred $1.6 billion
    from treasury stock to additional paid-in capital and
    $.2 billion from treasury stock to retained earnings,
    representing in total the weighted average cost of the treasury
    shares distributed.

In July 2003, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
    had initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $.04 per share. The
    dividend was increased each year thereafter, the latest increase
    occurring in the third quarter of 2007. The Company’s
    current quarterly dividend per share is $.17. Dividends declared
    were $104.6 million, $79.8 million and
    $73.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, the
    Company recorded a quarterly dividend payable of approximately
    $31.6 million to stockholders of record at the close of
    business on January 2, 2008.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

In July 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan
    (“1998 Plan”) to provide for grants of options to
    purchase shares of common stock, restricted stock and other
    equity-based compensation to employees and non-employee
    directors of the Company who are eligible to participate in the
    1998 Plan. The Company believes that such awards better align
    the interests of its employees with those of its stockholders.
    As of December 31, 2007, there were 3.4 million stock
    units reserved for future grants under the 1998 Plan.

The 1998 Plan expires on June 30, 2008. In February 2007,
    the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2007 Stock
    Incentive Plan (“2007 Plan”) to replace the 1998 Plan
    when it expires. The 2007 Plan was ratified by the
    Company’s stockholders in May 2007. Shares reserved for
    future grants under the 2007 Plan are 10.5 million.

Options granted under the 1998 Plan are non-qualified and are
    granted at a price equal to the fair market value of the
    Company’s common stock at the date of grant. Generally,
    options granted have a term of seven to ten years from the date
    of grant, and vest in increments of 25% per year over a four
    year period beginning on the first

The Company’s Board of Directors approved the acceleration
    of the vesting of all outstanding stock options previously
    awarded to employees effective December 30, 2005. As a
    result of this acceleration, the Company recorded a non-cash
    charge of $2.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2005.
    This acceleration was made in advance of the effective date of
    SFAS 123(R) and in anticipation of changes to the
    Company’s compensation programs in 2007.

During each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    the Company awarded 36,000 deferred stock units to its
    non-employee directors under its 1998 Plan. These stock units
    vest immediately, but the directors receive the underlying
    shares only after their board service ends. The stock units do
    not carry any voting or dividend rights, except the right to
    receive additional stock units in lieu of dividends.

Also during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company awarded 186,000 and 127,500 shares of restricted
    stock, respectively, to its executive officers. 21,000 and
    19,500 of the shares awarded during 2007 and 2006, respectively,
    vested effective January 1 of the subsequent year. 135,000 and
    108,000, respectively, of the shares awarded vest in four equal
    annual installments beginning on the anniversary date of the
    original grant except that vesting may be accelerated if certain
    performance targets are achieved. The remaining shares awarded
    during 2007 vest effective December 31, 2008. During the
    vesting period, the participants have voting rights and receive
    dividends declared and paid on the shares, but the shares may
    not be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise

encumbered. Additionally, granted but unvested shares are
    forfeited in the event the participant resigns employment with
    the Company for other than good reason.

The fair value of stock units and restricted shares on the date
    of grant is amortized ratably over the vesting period, or the
    accelerated vesting period if certain performance targets are
    achieved. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005, compensation expense related to stock units and
    restricted shares of $4.6 million, $4.9 million and
    $3.2 million, respectively, was recorded. The compensation
    expense for restricted stock during the year ended
    December 31, 2006 includes $1.4 million of incremental
    expense for accelerating the expense recognition period for
    grants to employees that are or will become retirement-eligible
    during the stated vesting period of the restricted stock as
    required under SFAS 123(R) based on the retirement terms
    that were in effect at that time.

The Company also maintains the Republic Services 401(k) Plan
    (the “Plan”), which is a defined contribution plan
    covering all eligible employees. Under the provisions of the
    Plan, participants may direct the Company to defer a portion of
    their compensation to the Plan, subject to Internal Revenue Code
    limitations. In 2005, the Company provided matching
    contributions of 50% of the amount contributed by each
    participant up to 4% of the employee’s salary. Effective
    January 1, 2006, the Plan was amended to increase the
    employer matching contribution to 100% of the first 3% of
    eligible compensation and 50% of the next 2% of eligible
    compensation contributed by each employee. The employer match
    was made in shares of the Company’s common stock through
    June 30, 2005. Contributions made after that date were
    funded in cash. Total expense recorded for the Company’s
    matching 401(k) contribution in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $10.9 million, $10.1 million and $4.2 million,
    respectively. Both employee and Company contributions vest
    immediately.

EARNINGS
    PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares (including
    restricted stock and vested but unissued deferred stock units)
    outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is
    based on the combined weighted average number of common shares
    and common share equivalents outstanding which include, where
    appropriate, the assumed exercise of employee stock options

During November 2007, the Company entered into an option
    agreement related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under
    SFAS 133, the option qualified for and was designated as an

    month in equal notional amounts of 60,000 gallons through
    December 31, 2013. In accordance with SFAS 133,
    $.3 million representing the effective portion of the
    change in fair value as of December 31, 2007, net of tax,
    has been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion
    of the change in fair value was not material and has been
    recorded in other income (expense), net in the Company’s
    Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

During September 2006, the Company entered into option
    agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under
    SFAS 133, the options qualified for and were designated as
    effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel
    fuel purchases. These option agreements commenced on
    October 2, 2006 and settled each month in equal notional
    amounts of 500,000 gallons through December 31, 2007. In
    accordance with SFAS 133, $1.4 million representing
    the effective portion of the change in fair value as of

    fair value was not material and has been recorded in other
    income (expense), net in the Company’s Consolidated
    Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    Realized losses of $1.6 million and $.9 million
    related to these option agreements are included in cost of
    operations in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
    Income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

During October 2005, the Company entered into option agreements
    related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under
    SFAS 133, the options qualified for and were designated as
    effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel
    fuel purchases. These option agreements commenced on
    January 1, 2006 and settled each month in equal notional
    amounts of 500,000 gallons through December 2006. In accordance
    with SFAS 133, $.4 million representing the effective
    portion of the change in fair value as of December 31,
    2005, net of tax, has been recorded in stockholders’ equity
    as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The
    ineffective portion of the change in fair value was not material
    and has been recorded in other income (expense), net in the
    Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized
    losses of $.4 million related to these option agreements
    are included in cost of operations in the Company’s

During March 2005, the Company entered into option agreements
    related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under
    SFAS 133, the options qualified for and were designated as
    effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel
    fuel purchases. These option agreements settled each month in
    equal notional amounts through December 2005. The ineffective
    portion of the change in fair value was not material for the
    year ended December 31, 2005 and was included in other
    income (expense), net in the Company’s Unaudited Condensed
    Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains of
    $2.5 million related to these option agreements are
    included in cost of operations in the Company’s
    Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

During March 2005, the Company offered to exchange a portion of
    its outstanding 7.125% notes due 2009 for new notes due
    2035. To protect against fluctuations in the forecasted receipt
    of proceeds resulting from the issuance of thirty-year, fixed
    rate debt due to changes in the benchmark U.S. Treasury
    rate, the Company entered into treasury lock agreements. In
    accordance with SFAS 133, these agreements were determined
    to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash proceeds to
    be received upon issuance of the notes. Upon termination of
    these agreements in March 2005, the Company recorded a gain of
    $2.3 million, net of tax, in stockholders’ equity as a
    component of

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal
    Proceedings

On March 26, 2007, Republic Services of Ohio II, LLC
    (“Republic-Ohio”), an Ohio limited liability company
    and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, was issued Final
    Findings and Orders from the Ohio Environmental Protection
    Agency. The F&Os relate to environmental conditions
    attributed to a chemical reaction resulting from the disposal of
    certain aluminum production waste at the Countywide Recycling
    and Disposal facility in East Sparta, Ohio. The F&Os, and
    certain other remedial actions Republic-Ohio has agreed with the
    OEPA to undertake to address the environmental conditions,
    include, without limitation, the following actions:
    (a) prohibiting leachate recirculation, (b) refraining
    from the disposal of solid waste in certain portions of the
    site, (c) updating engineering plans and specifications and
    providing further information regarding the integrity of various
    engineered components at the site, (d) performing
    additional data collection, (e) taking additional measures
    to address emissions, (f) expanding the gas collection and
    control system, (g) installing a “fire” break,
    (h) removing liquids from gas extraction wells, and
    (i) submitting a plan to the OEPA to suppress the chemical
    reaction and, following approval by the OEPA, implementing such
    plan. The Company also paid approximately $.7 million in
    sanctions to comply with the F&Os. Currently, Republic-Ohio
    is performing certain interim remedial actions required by the
    OEPA, but the OEPA has not approved Republic-Ohio’s plan to
    suppress the chemical reaction.

Republic-Ohio has also received a request from the U.S. EPA
    to cooperate and address certain environmental conditions at
    Countywide. Republic-Ohio has indicated its willingness to
    cooperate with the U.S. EPA on these issues. Republic-Ohio
    is in the process of or has already substantially completed the
    activities identified in the U.S. EPA’s letter.

The Company learned that the Commissioner of the Stark County
    Health Department recommended that the Health Board suspend
    Countywide’s 2007 annual operating license. The Company has
    also learned that the Commissioner intends to recommend that the
    Health Board deny Countywide’s pending license application
    for 2008. Republic-Ohio obtained a preliminary injunction
    prohibiting the Health Board from suspending its 2007 operating
    license and has also obtained a Temporary Restraining Order
    prohibiting the Health Board from denying its 2008 operating
    license application.

The Company believes that the Company has diligently performed
    all actions required under the F&Os and that Countywide
    does not pose a threat to the environment. In addition, there
    are indications that the reaction is beginning to subside. As
    such, the Company believes that it satisfies the rules and
    regulations that govern the operating license at Countywide. The
    Company disagrees with the Commissioner’s recommendation
    and will pursue all legal remedies available regarding licensing
    of the facility.

If the Company is not successful with such legal and
    administrative remedies, the Company will be required to close
    Countywide and record a non-cash charge of approximately
    $90 million for asset impairment and a charge of
    approximately $10 million for acceleration of future
    capping, closure and post-closure activities. In addition, the
    Company will forego future cash flows expected to be generated
    by Countywide and a portion of the cash flows from the
    Company’s Cleveland and Akron marketplaces. The annual
    projected future net cash flows are estimated to be
    approximately $16 million.

The Company intends to vigorously pursue financial contribution
    from third parties for its costs to comply with the F&Os,
    other required remedial actions and, if necessary, any costs
    related to the closing of Countywide.

The Company is a party to various general legal proceedings
    which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While the
    results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the

any, resulting from the ultimate resolution of these matters
    will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows. However, unfavorable resolution could affect the
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows for the quarterly periods in which they are resolved.

Lease
    Commitments

The Company and its subsidiaries lease real property, equipment
    and software under various operating leases with terms from one
    month to twenty years. Rent expense during the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $11.5 million,
    $11.8 million and $12.3 million, respectively.

Future minimum lease obligations under non-cancelable real
    property, equipment and software operating leases with initial
    terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2007 are as
    follows:

Unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of

    dispose of a minimum number of tons at certain third-party
    facilities.

Liability
    Insurance

The Company’s insurance programs for workers’
    compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and
    employee-related health care benefits are effectively
    self-insured. The Company carries general liability, vehicle
    liability, employment practices liability, pollution liability,
    directors and officers liability, workers’ compensation and
    employer’s liability coverage, as well as umbrella
    liability policies to provide excess coverage over the
    underlying limits contained in these primary policies. The
    Company also carries property insurance. Claims in

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All
    tables in millions, except per share
    data) — (Continued)

excess of self-insurance levels are fully insured subject to
    policy limits. Accruals are based on claims filed and estimates
    of claims incurred but not reported.

The Company’s liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not
    reported claims at December 31, 2007 (which includes claims
    for workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle
    liability and employee health care benefits) were
    $178.0 million under its current risk management program
    and are included in other current and other liabilities in the
    Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. While the ultimate
    amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments,
    in management’s opinion, recorded reserves are adequate to
    cover the future payment of claims. However, it is possible that
    recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future
    payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to estimates recorded
    resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income in the periods in which such
    adjustments are known.

Guarantees
    of Subsidiary Debt

The Company has guaranteed the tax-exempt bonds of its
    subsidiaries. If a subsidiary fails to meet its obligations
    associated with tax-exempt bonds as they come due, the Company
    will be required to perform under the related guarantee
    agreement. No additional liability has been recorded for these
    guarantees because the underlying obligations are reflected in
    the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. (For further
    information, see Note 5, Debt.)

Restricted
    Cash and Other Financial Guarantees

In the normal course of business, the Company is required by
    regulatory agencies, governmental entities and contract parties
    to post performance bonds, letters of credit or cash deposits as
    financial guarantees of the Company’s performance. A
    summary of letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding is as
    follows:

    bonds expire on various dates through 2014.

The Company’s restricted cash deposits include restricted
    cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt
    facilities, and restricted cash pledged to regulatory agencies
    and governmental entities as financial guarantees of the
    Company’s performance related to its final capping, closure
    and post-closure obligations at its landfills as follows:

Other
    Matters

The Company’s business activities are conducted in the
    context of a developing and changing statutory and regulatory
    framework. Governmental regulation of the waste management
    industry requires the Company to obtain and retain numerous
    governmental permits to conduct various aspects of its
    operations. These permits are subject to revocation,
    modification or denial. The costs and other capital expenditures
    which may be required to obtain or

    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All
    tables in millions, except per share
    data) — (Continued)

retain the applicable permits or comply with applicable
    regulations could be significant. Any revocation, modification
    or denial of permits could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company.

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local tax
    rules and regulations. The Company’s compliance with such
    rules and regulations is periodically audited by tax
    authorities. These authorities may challenge the positions taken
    in the Company’s tax filings. As such, to provide for
    certain potential tax exposures, the Company maintains
    liabilities for uncertain tax positions for its estimate of the
    final outcome of the examinations. (For further information
    related to the Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax
    positions, see Note 6, Income Taxes.)

Management believes that the liabilities for uncertain tax
    positions recorded are adequate. However, a significant
    assessment against the Company in excess of the liabilities
    recorded could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

(a)

During the three months ended
    March 31, 2007, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of
    $22.0 million ($13.5 million, or $.07 per diluted
    share, net of tax) related to estimated costs the Company
    believed would be required to comply with Final Findings and
    Orders issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in
    response to environmental conditions at its Countywide Recycling
    and Disposal Facility in East Sparta, Ohio. The Company has
    complied with and will continue to comply with the F&Os.
    However, while there are indications that the reaction is
    beginning to subside, the Company has nevertheless agreed with
    the OEPA to take certain additional remedial actions at
    Countywide, including creating multiple barriers in the landfill
    to further isolate the reaction. Consequently, the Company
    recorded an additional pre-tax charge of $23.3 million
    ($14.4 million, or $.08 per diluted share, net of tax)
    during the three months ended September 30, 2007. While the
    Company intends to vigorously pursue financial contributions
    from third parties for its costs to comply with the F&Os
    and the additional remedial actions, it has not recorded any
    receivables for potential recoveries. During the three months
    ended September 30, 2007, the Company also recorded a
    pre-tax charge of $9.6 million charge ($5.9 million,
    or $.03 per diluted share, net of tax) associated with an
    increase in estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to
    upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at
    the Company’s closed disposal facility in Contra Costa
    County, California.

(b)

During the three months ended
    March 31, 2007, the Company recorded a charge of
    $4.2 million, or $.02 per diluted share, in its provision
    for income taxes related to the resolution of various income tax
    matters. During the three months ended June 30, 2007, the
    Company recorded a benefit of $5.0 million, or $.03 per
    diluted share, in its provision for income taxes related to the
    resolution of various tax matters, including the effective
    completion of Internal Revenue Service audits of the
    Company’s consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001
    through 2004. During the three months ended December 31,
    2007, the Company recorded a benefit of $4.0 million, or
    $.02 per diluted share, in its provision for income taxes
    related to the resolution of various income tax matters. During
    the third quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a
    $5.1 million income tax benefit related to the resolution
    of various income tax matters, including the effective
    completion of Internal Revenue Service audits for the years 1998
    through 2000.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON REPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.’S INTERNAL CONTROL
    OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We, as members of management of Republic Services, Inc. are
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
    Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
    management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable
    assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that
    could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control
    systems and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of
    the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
    of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
    issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

We, under the supervision of and with the participation of our
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
    Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, assessed the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting
    described in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    assessment, we concluded that we maintained effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
    based on the specified criteria.

Our internal control over financial reporting has been audited
    by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is
    included herein.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(e),

and

15d-15(e))

as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based
    upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
    this Annual Report.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Based on an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, there has been no change in
    our internal control over financial reporting during our last
    fiscal quarter identified in connection with that evaluation,
    that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
