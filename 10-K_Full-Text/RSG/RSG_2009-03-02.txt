PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

As of December 31, 2008, we are the second largest provider
    of services in the domestic non-hazardous solid waste industry.
    We provide non-hazardous solid waste collection services for
    commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers
    through 400 collection companies in 40 states and Puerto
    Rico. We also own or operate 242 transfer stations, 213 active
    solid waste landfills and 78 recycling facilities. We were
    incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1996.

Based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications,
    we believe that the United States non-hazardous solid waste
    services industry generates annual revenue of approximately
    $52.0 billion, of which approximately 58% is generated by
    publicly owned waste companies. For 2008, and after giving
    effect to the merger described below, we and one other company
    generated a significant percentage of the publicly owned
    companies’ total revenue. Additionally, industry data
    indicates that the non-hazardous waste industry in the United
    States remains fragmented as privately held companies and
    municipal and other local governmental authorities generate
    approximately 16% and 26% respectively, of total industry
    revenue. In general, growth in the solid waste industry is
    linked to growth in the overall economy, including the level of
    new households and business formation and is subject to changes
    in residential and commercial construction activity.

On December 5, 2008, we completed our merger with Allied.
    On the effective date of the merger each share of Allied common
    stock outstanding was converted into .45 shares of our
    common stock. We issued approximately 195.8 million shares
    of common stock to Allied stockholders in the transaction. As a
    condition to the merger, we agreed to divest of certain assets
    as required by the Antitrust Division of the
    U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) under the
    Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act (HSR Act). In February 2009, we
    announced an agreement to sell Waste Connections, Inc. the
    majority of the assets we are required to divest. The assets
    being divested include six municipal solid waste landfills, six
    collection operations and three transfer stations across seven
    markets. This transaction is subject to closing conditions
    regarding due diligence, regulatory approval and other customary
    matters. Closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of
    2009. However, the timing and proceeds received from the
    divestiture to Waste Connections, and the divestiture of the
    remaining assets as required by the DOJ, cannot be predicted. In
    addition, the merger is expected to generate total annual
    run-rate integration synergies, primarily resulting from
    operating efficiencies, economies of scale, and leveraging
    corporate and overhead resources of approximately
    $150.0 million by the end of 2010. We have identified and
    are on track to realize in 2009 approximately
    $100.0 million, or 67% of the total expected annual
    run-rate synergies. Our financial results for 2008 include
    Allied’s operating results from the date of the merger, and
    have not been retroactively restated to include Allied’s
    historical financial position or results of operations.

Our operations are national in scope, but the physical
    collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business;
    therefore, the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our
    markets. By combining local operating management with
    standardized business practices, we can drive greater overall
    operating efficiency across the company, while maintaining

day-to-day

operating decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.
    We facilitate the implementation of this strategy through an
    organizational structure that groups our operations within a
    corporate, region and area structure. We manage our operations
    through four geographic operating segments which are also our
    reportable segments: Eastern, Central, Southern and Western. Due
    to the timing of our acquisition of Allied, management reviewed
    and we have presented Allied as a separate operating segment in
    our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, during the
    first quarter of 2008, we realigned our reporting segments and
    consolidated our previous Southwestern



operations into our Western operations. The boundaries of our
    operating segments may change from time to time. Each of our
    regions is organized into several operating areas and each area
    contains multiple operating locations. Each of our regions and
    substantially all our areas provide collection, transfer,
    recycling and disposal services. We believe this structure
    facilitates the integration of our operations within each
    region, which is a critical component of our operating strategy,
    and allows us to maximize the growth opportunities in each of
    our markets and to operate the business efficiently, while
    maintaining effective controls and standards over operational
    and administrative matters, including financial reporting. See
    Note 14,

Segment Reporting,

to our consolidated
    financial statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for further discussion of our operating segments.

We had revenue of $3.7 billion and $3.2 billion and
    operating income of $283.2 million and $536.0 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. In addition to our merger with Allied, there were
    a number of items that impacted our 2008 financial results. For
    a description of these items, see Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Overview of Our
    Business and Consolidated Results of Operations

included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our presence in markets with growing populations throughout the
    Sunbelt, including California, Arizona and Texas, and in other
    domestic markets that have experienced higher than average
    population growth during the past several years, supports our
    internal growth strategy. We believe that our presence in these
    markets positions us to experience growth at rates that are
    generally higher than the industry’s overall growth rate.

We continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by
    implementing our financial, operating and growth strategies as
    described below.

Financial
    Strategy

Key components of our financial strategy include our ability to
    generate free cash flow and sustain or improve our return on
    invested capital. Our definition of free cash flow, which is not
    a measure determined in accordance with United States generally
    accepted accounting principles (GAAP), is cash provided by
    operating activities less purchases of property and equipment,
    plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented
    in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We believe that
    free cash flow is a driver of shareholder value and provides
    useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our
    operating activities after expenditures for property and
    equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment.
    It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial
    strategy, which includes reinvesting in capital assets to ensure
    a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to
    facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided,
    maintaining our investment grade ratings and minimizing debt,
    paying cash dividends and maintaining and improving our market
    position through business optimization. In addition, free cash
    flow is a key metric used to determine compensation.

Furthermore, we expect to generate total annual run-rate
    integration synergies, in connection with the merger with
    Allied, of approximately $150.0 million by the end of 2010,
    primarily by achieving greater operating efficiencies, capturing
    inherent economies of scale, and leveraging corporate and
    overhead resources. We have identified and are on track to
    realize $100.0 million of annual run-rate integration
    benefits by the end of 2009. We are confident that we will be
    able to realize the balance of the targeted $150.0 million
    in synergies in the second year following the merger despite the
    economic slowdown. Consequently, we have developed and
    implemented incentive programs that help focus our entire
    company on the realization of key financial metrics of
    increasing free cash flow, achieving targeted earnings,
    maintaining and improving returns on invested capital, as well
    as achieving integration synergies.

The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations.
    Free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for
    discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain
    expenditures that are required or to which we have committed,
    such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our
    definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly
    titled measures presented by other companies.



We manage our free cash flow primarily by ensuring that capital
    expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light
    of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely
    managing our working capital, which consists primarily of
    accounts receivable and accounts payable.

We have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize
    shareholder value as well as our return on investment. This
    includes the following:

§

Customer Service.

We will continue to
    reinvest in our existing fleet of vehicles, equipment, landfills
    and facilities to ensure the highest level of service to our
    customers and the communities we serve. We continue to focus on
    innovative waste disposal processes and programs to help our
    customers obtain their goals around sustainability and
    environmentally sound waste practices. We believe that these in
    turn will help us achieve profitable growth.

§

Internal Growth —

Price Growth.

Growth through price increases helps
    ensure that we obtain an adequate return on our substantial
    capital investment and the business risk associated with such
    investment. Price increases also allow us to recover historical
    and current year increases in operating costs, which ultimately
    enhances our operating margins.

Volume Growth.

Growth through increases in our
    customer base and services provided is the most capital
    efficient means for us to build our business. This includes not
    only expanding landfill and transfer capacity and investing in
    trucks and containers, but also includes investing in
    information tools and training needed to ensure high
    productivity and quality service throughout all functional areas
    of our business. We work to increase collection and disposal
    volumes while insuring that prices charged for such services
    provide an appropriate return on our capital investment.

§

Maintain Our Credit Ratings.

We believe that
    a key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining
    investment grade ratings on our senior debt, which was rated BBB
    by Standard & Poor’s, BBB- by Fitch and Baa3 by
    Moody’s as of December 31, 2008. Such ratings have
    allowed us, and should continue to allow us, to readily access
    capital markets at competitive rates. As such, we intend to
    continue to use our free cash flow and proceeds from sale of
    operations to reduce our debt.

§

Dividends.

In July 2003, our Board of
    Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $.04 per share.
    The dividend has been increased each year thereafter, the latest
    increase occurring in the third quarter of 2008, representing an
    average annualized growth rate of approximately 36%. Our current
    quarterly dividend per share is $.19. We may consider increasing
    our quarterly cash dividend if we believe it will enhance
    shareholder value.

§

Market Growth and Optimization.

Within our
    markets, our goal is to deliver sustainable, long-term
    profitable growth while efficiently operating our assets to
    generate acceptable rates of return. We allocate capital to
    businesses, markets and development projects to support growth
    while achieving acceptable rates of return. We develop
    previously non-permitted, non-contiguous landfill sites
    (greenfield landfill sites). We also expand our existing
    landfill sites, when possible. We supplement this organic growth
    with acquisitions of operating assets, such as landfills,
    transfer stations, and tuck-in acquisitions of collection and
    disposal operations in existing markets. We continuously
    evaluate our existing operating assets and their deployment
    within each market to determine if we have optimized our
    position and to ensure appropriate investment of capital. Where
    operations are not generating acceptable returns, we examine
    opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and returns
    through the integration of additional assets. If such
    enhancements are not possible, we may ultimately decide to
    divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other
    markets.

For certain risks related to our financial strategy, see
    Item 1A.

Risk Factors

.



Operating
    Strategy

We seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to
    increase operating margins and enhance shareholder value. Our
    operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the
    following:

§

utilize the extensive industry knowledge and experience of our
    executive management team,

§

utilize a decentralized management structure in overseeing

day-to-day

operations,

§

integrate waste operations,

§

improve operating margins through economies of scale, cost
    efficiencies and asset utilization,

§

achieve high levels of customer satisfaction, and

§

utilize business information systems to improve consistency in
    financial and operational performance.

§

Experienced Executive Management Team.

We
    believe that we have one of the most experienced executive
    management teams in the solid waste industry.

James E. O’Connor, who has served as our Chief Executive
    Officer (CEO) since December 1998, also became our Chairman in
    January 2003. He worked at Waste Management, Inc. from 1972 to
    1978 and from 1982 to 1998. During that time, he served in
    various management positions, including Senior Vice President in
    1997 and 1998, and Area President of Waste Management of
    Florida, Inc. from 1992 to 1997. Mr. O’Connor has
    34 years of experience in the solid waste industry.

Donald W. Slager became our President & Chief Operating
    Officer (COO) upon our merging with Allied in December 2008.
    Prior to the merger, Mr. Slager worked for Allied from 1992
    through 2008 and served in various management positions,
    including President & COO from 2004 through 2008 and
    Executive Vice President and COO from 2003 to 2004. From 2001 to
    2003, Mr. Slager served as Senior Vice President,
    Operations. He held various management positions at Allied from
    1992 to 2003, and was previously General Manager at National
    Waste Services, where he served in various management positions
    since 1985. Mr. Slager has over 23 years of experience in
    the solid waste industry.

Tod C. Holmes has served as our Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
    since August 1998. Mr. Holmes served as our Vice President
    of Finance from June 1998 until August 1998 and as Vice
    President of Finance of our former parent company’s Solid
    Waste Group from January 1998 until June 1998. From 1987 to
    1998, Mr. Holmes served in various management positions
    with Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc., including Vice President,
    Investor Relations from 1996 to 1998, Divisional Vice President,
    Collection Operations from 1995 to 1996, Divisional Vice
    President and Regional Controller — Northern Region
    from 1993 to 1995, and Divisional Vice President and Assistant
    Corporate Controller from 1991 to 1993. Mr. Holmes has over
    21 years of experience in the solid waste industry.

Our regional senior vice presidents have an average of 21 years
    of experience in the industry.

§

Merger Integration Strategy.

As
    previously mentioned, on December 5, 2008 we completed our
    merger with Allied. We believe this merger is different than
    historical attempts to consolidate the waste industry for a
    number of reasons including the following:

§

Two Mature Companies.

Most previous attempts to
    consolidate the waste industry focused on a “roll up”
    strategy often involving relatively young companies solely
    focused on increasing revenue through acquisitions. Our merger
    with Allied involved two mature companies with similar business
    practices and performance metrics that have been developed and
    refined over the course of a number of years. We believe that
    the combination of our maturity and proven business practices
    and performance metrics will be a critical component of our
    future success.

§

Best Practices.

Our merger also affords us the
    opportunity to select the best tools and systems and to adopt
    the best practices of two successful companies. Republic has a
    history of financial discipline evident in the consistent
    generation of increasing levels of free cash flow. Allied is
    noted for its



integrated operations and focus on procurement. We believe that
    our merger gives us a unique opportunity to combine the
    strengths of these two successful organizations and create a
    best-in-class waste management company.

§

Timely and Focused Integration Process.

We are
    acutely aware that previous acquisitions in the waste management
    and other industries failed because of a lack of focus on
    integration. As such, we began to develop our integration
    process and strategy in June 2008, long before our merger
    was consummated. Our process identified specific integration
    related tasks focused on all levels of the organization,
    especially our individual business units. We have engaged
    employees at all levels of the company in this process to
    develop a detailed integration plan and ensure that each of our
    employees understands their role in the process.

§

Strong Operating Platform.

The combination of
    Republic and Allied creates a company with a strong, national
    operating platform. The foundation of this platform is our large
    network of disposal sites. This disposal network provides us
    with a far stronger vertically integrated operating structure
    than either company would be able to achieve on its own. We
    believe that our improved vertically integrated operations will
    be a key driver of our future profitability.

§

Complementary Operations.

The overlay of our
    operating locations reflects another compelling attribute of our
    merger. We operate complementary geographies. We also share very
    similar cultures that are centered on a shared commitment to
    providing “industry-leading solid waste and environmental
    services that exceed our customers’ highest
    expectations.”

§

Significant Synergies.

We have identified
    approximately $150.0 million of annual run-rate synergies
    associated with the merger. These synergies focus on right
    sizing our combined corporate and field staff. They also take
    advantage of our complementary operations which allows us to
    eliminate duplicative facilities and collection routes. All of
    our employees are focused on the achievement of our operating
    strategies. In addition, certain employees whose role is
    considered critical will be incentivized based upon the timely
    achievement of our synergy goal. We believe that such incentives
    help to further focus our management team on increasing
    shareholder value.

§

Strong Capital Structure.

Unlike many other mergers
    or acquisitions in the waste management and other industries,
    Republic Services enjoys a strong capital structure and
    investment grade credit ratings post-merger. Our combination
    with Allied creates a company that will produce substantial
    annual free cash flow. This strong cash producing characteristic
    will allow us to pursue our mission of increasing shareholder
    value by focusing on investing in our business, paying down our
    debt and funding dividends.

§

Decentralized Management Structure.

We
    maintain a relatively small corporate headquarters staff,
    relying on a decentralized management structure to minimize
    administrative overhead costs and to manage our

day-to-day

operations more efficiently. Our local management has extensive
    industry experience in growing, operating and managing solid
    waste companies and has substantial experience in their local
    geographic markets. Each regional management team includes a
    senior vice president of operations, vice president-controller,
    vice president of human resources, vice president of sales, vice
    president of operations support, director of safety, director of
    engineering and environmental management, and director of market
    planning and development. We believe that our strong regional
    management teams allow us to more effectively and efficiently
    drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout our
    organization. Our regional management teams and our area
    presidents have extensive authority, responsibility and autonomy
    for operations within their respective geographic markets.
    Compensation for our area management teams is primarily based on
    the improvement in operating income produced and the free cash
    flow and return on invested capital generated in each
    manager’s geographic area of responsibility. In addition,
    through long-term incentive programs, including stock options,
    we believe we have one of the lowest turnover levels in the
    industry for our local management teams. As a result of
    retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and
    involvement in their local communities, we are proactive in
    anticipating our customers’ needs and adjusting to changes
    in our markets. We also seek to implement the best practices of
    our various regions and areas throughout our operations to
    improve operating margins.



§

Integrated Operations.

We seek to achieve a
    high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from
    the point of collection through disposal. We expect that our
    fully integrated markets generally will have a lower cost of
    operations and more favorable cash flows than our non-integrated
    markets. Through acquisitions, landfill operating agreements and
    other market development activities, we create market-specific,
    integrated operations typically consisting of one or more
    collection companies, transfer stations and landfills. We
    consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with
    significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels
    of waste volume. We also seek to acquire solid waste collection
    companies in markets in which we own or operate landfills. In
    addition, we generate internal growth in our disposal operations
    by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills
    from time to time in markets in which we have significant
    collection operations or in markets that we determine lack
    sufficient disposal capacity. During December 2008, subsequent
    to our acquisition of Allied, approximately 67% of the total
    volume of waste that we collected was disposed of at landfills
    we own or operate. In a number of our larger markets, we and our
    competitors are required to take waste to government-controlled
    disposal facilities. This provides us with an opportunity to
    effectively compete in these markets without investing in
    landfill capacity. Because we do not have landfill facilities or
    government-controlled disposal facilities for all markets in
    which we provide collection services, we believe that through
    landfill and transfer station acquisitions, operating
    agreements, and market development, we have the opportunity to
    increase our waste internalization rate and further integrate
    our operations. By further integrating operations in existing
    markets through acquisitions, operating agreements and
    development of landfills and transfer stations, we may be able
    to reduce our disposal costs.

§

Economies of Scale, Cost Efficiencies and Asset
    Utilization.

We continue to identify and implement
    best practices throughout our organization with the goal of
    permanently improving overall operating and financial results.
    These best practice initiatives focus on critical areas of our
    operations such as landfill operations, truck routing,
    maintenance and related service efficiencies, purchasing and
    administrative activities. The consolidation of acquired
    businesses into existing operations reduces costs by decreasing
    capital and expenses used for truck routing, personnel,
    equipment and vehicle maintenance, inventories and back-office
    administration. Generally, we consolidate our acquired
    administrative centers to reduce our general and administrative
    costs. Of particular benefit are the opportunities associated
    with the blending of operations as a result of the Allied
    merger. Scheduled for completion by early 2010, these markets
    offer the potential for marked improvement in operating results.
    Generally speaking, there are significant opportunities in these
    markets to leverage economies of scale and the existing asset
    base, while realizing improved operating efficiencies. Upon the
    completion of the integration of Allied, our goal is to maintain
    our selling, general and administrative costs at no more than
    10.0% of revenue, which we believe is appropriate given our
    existing business platform. In addition, our procurement
    initiatives ensure that we negotiate the best volume discounts
    for goods and services purchased, including waste disposal rates
    at landfills operated by third parties. Furthermore, we have
    taken steps to maximize the utilization of our assets. For
    example, to reduce the number of collection vehicles and
    maximize the efficiency of our fleet and drivers, we use a route
    optimization program to minimize drive times and improve
    operating density. By using assets more efficiently, operating
    expenses can be reduced.

§

High Levels of Customer Satisfaction.

We
    strive to provide the highest level of service to our customer
    base. Our policy is to periodically visit each commercial
    account to ensure customer satisfaction and to verify that we
    are providing the appropriate level of service. In addition to
    visiting existing customers, a salesperson develops a base of
    prospective customers within each market. We also have municipal
    marketing representatives in most service areas that are
    responsible for working with each municipality or community to
    which we provide residential service to ensure customer
    satisfaction. Additionally, the municipal representatives
    organize and drive the effort to obtain new or renew municipal
    contracts in their service areas.

§

Focus on Systems Utilization.

We continue to
    invest in the integration and expansion of our information
    systems and technology platform. Our future platform will
    consist of

best-in-class



legacy systems from both Republic and Allied. Our initiatives
    will include customer relationship management, billing,
    productivity, maintenance, general ledger and human resource
    systems. We believe that the combination of these systems will
    prove to be a competitive advantage for our company.

    Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

Growth
    Strategy

Our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue, gaining
    market share and enhancing shareholder value through internal
    growth and acquisitions. We manage our growth strategy as
    follows:

§

Internal Growth.

Our internal growth strategy
    focuses on retaining existing customers and obtaining
    commercial, municipal and industrial customers through our
    well-managed sales and marketing activities.

Pricing Activities.

We seek to secure price
    increases necessary to offset increased costs, to improve our
    operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our
    substantial investments in assets such as our landfills. During
    2008, we continued to secure broad-based price increases across
    all lines of our business to offset various escalating capital
    and operating costs. Price increases will remain a major
    component of our overall future operating strategy.

Long-Term Contracts.

We seek to obtain long-term
    contracts for collecting solid waste in markets with growing
    populations. These include exclusive franchise agreements with
    municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts.
    By obtaining such long-term agreements, we have the opportunity
    to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the
    underlying population growth in these markets. We believe it is
    important to have secured exclusive, long-term franchise
    agreements in market areas in some of the fastest growing states
    according to the U.S. Census Bureau, for example, Arizona,
    Texas and California. We believe that this positions us to
    experience internal growth rates that are generally higher than
    our industry’s overall growth rate. In addition, we believe
    that by securing a base of long-term recurring revenue in
    growing population markets, we are better able to protect our
    market position from competition and our business may be less
    susceptible to downturns in economic conditions.

Sales and Marketing Activities.

We seek to manage
    our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on
    our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate.
    We provide a National Accounts program in response to the needs
    of our national clients, centralizing services to effectively
    manage their needs, such as minimizing their procurement costs.
    We currently have approximately 1,200 sales and marketing
    employees in the field who are compensated using a commission
    structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality
    revenue. For the most part, these employees directly solicit
    business from existing and prospective commercial, industrial,
    municipal and residential customers. We emphasize our rate and
    cost structures when we train new and existing sales personnel.
    In addition, we utilize a customer relationship management
    system that assists our sales people in tracking leads. It also
    tracks renewal periods for potential commercial, industrial and
    franchise contracts.

Development Activities.

We seek to identify
    opportunities to further our position as an integrated service
    provider in markets where we provide services for a portion of
    the waste stream. Where appropriate, we seek to obtain permits
    to build transfer stations and landfills that would provide
    vertically integrated waste services or expand the service areas
    for our existing disposal sites. Development projects, while
    generally less capital intensive, typically require extensive
    permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no
    assurance of success. We undertake development projects when we
    believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where
    reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available.

§

Acquisition Growth.

We look to acquire
    businesses that complement our existing business platform. Our
    acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on privately held
    solid waste companies and the waste operations of municipal and
    other local governmental authorities. We believe that our
    ability to



acquire privately held companies is enhanced by increasing
    competition in the solid waste industry, increasing capital
    requirements as a result of changes in solid waste regulatory
    requirements, and the limited number of exit strategies for
    these privately held companies’ owners and principals. We
    also seek to acquire operations and facilities from
    municipalities that are privatizing, as they seek to increase
    available capital and reduce risk. In addition, we will continue
    to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities
    that are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies.
    In sum, our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on the
    following:

§

acquiring privately held businesses that position us for growth
    in existing and new markets,

§

acquiring well-managed companies and, when appropriate,
    retaining local management, and

§

acquiring operations and facilities from municipalities that are
    privatizing and publicly owned companies that are divesting of
    assets.

We also seek to acquire landfills, transfer stations and
    collection companies that operate in markets that we are already
    servicing in order to fully integrate our operations from
    collection to disposal. In addition, we have in the past and may
    continue in the future to exchange businesses with other solid
    waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our
    business platform. These activities allow us to increase our
    revenue and market share, lower our cost of operations as a
    percentage of revenue, and consolidate duplicative facilities
    and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of
    scale.

On December 5, 2008, we completed our merger with Allied.
    We expect to achieve total annual run-rate integration
    synergies, primarily relating to operating efficiencies,
    inherent economies of scale, and leveraging corporate and
    overhead resources of approximately $150.0 million by the
    end of 2010. We have identified and are on track to realize in
    2009 approximately $100.0 million, or 67%, of the total
    expected annual run-rate synergies.

For certain risks related to our growth strategy, see
    Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

Operations

Our operations primarily consist of the collection, transfer and
    disposal of non-hazardous solid waste.

§

Collection Services.

We provide solid waste
    collection services to commercial, industrial, municipal and
    residential customers through 400 collection companies. In 2008,
    77.7% of our revenue was derived from collection services.
    Within the collection line of business, 33.7% of our revenue is
    from services provided to municipal and residential customers,
    40.6% is from services provided to commercial customers, and
    25.7% is from services provided to industrial and other
    customers.

Our residential collection operations involve the curbside
    collection of refuse from small containers into collection
    vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to
    landfills. Residential solid waste collection services are
    typically performed under contracts with municipalities, which
    we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us
    exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in
    their respective jurisdictions. These contracts or franchises
    usually range in duration from one to five years, although some
    of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer
    periods. Residential solid waste collection services may also be
    performed on a subscription basis, in which individual
    households contract directly with us. The fees received for
    subscription residential collection are based primarily on
    market factors, frequency and type of service, the distance to
    the disposal facility and cost of disposal. In general,
    subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in
    advance by the residential customers receiving the service.

In our commercial and industrial collection operations, we
    supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes. We
    also rent compactors to large waste generators. Commercial
    collection services are generally performed under one- to
    three-year service agreements, and fees are determined by
    considerations such as market factors, collection frequency,
    type of equipment furnished, the type and volume or weight of
    the waste collected, the distance to the disposal
    facility, and the cost of disposal.



We also provide waste collection services to industrial and
    construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms
    ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer. Our
    construction services are provided to the commercial
    construction and home building sectors. We collect the
    containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to
    a landfill or a transfer station for disposal.

We also provide recycling services in certain markets in
    compliance with local laws or the terms of our franchise
    agreements. These services include the curbside collection of
    residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of
    recycling services to commercial and industrial customers.

§

Transfer and Disposal Services.

We own or
    operate 242 transfer stations. We deposit waste at these
    transfer stations, as do other private haulers and municipal
    haulers, for compaction and transfer to trailers for transport
    to disposal sites or recycling facilities.

As of December 31, 2008, we owned or operated
    213 active landfills, which had approximately 36,900
    permitted acres and total available permitted and probable
    expansion disposal capacity of approximately 4.9 billion

in-place

cubic yards. The in-place capacity of our landfills is subject
    to change based on engineering factors, requirements of
    regulatory authorities, our ability to continue to operate our
    landfills in compliance with applicable regulations, and our
    ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain
    expansion permits at our sites. Some of our landfills accept
    non-hazardous special waste, including utility ash, asbestos and
    contaminated soils.

Most of our active landfill sites have the potential for
    expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted
    acreage. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal
    capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue
    an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste
    volumes and prices, market needs, remaining capacity and
    likelihood of obtaining an expansion. To satisfy future disposal
    demand, we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at
    certain of our landfills. However, no assurances can be made
    that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as
    designed.

We also have responsibility for 126 closed landfills, for which
    we have associated closure and post-closure liabilities.

§

Recycling Facilities and Other Services.

We
    own or operate 78 materials recovery facilities and other
    recycling operations. These facilities sort recyclable paper,
    aluminum, glass and other materials. Most of these recyclable
    materials are internally collected by our residential collection
    operations. In some areas, we receive commercial and industrial
    solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable
    materials and non-recyclable waste. The recyclable materials are
    salvaged, repackaged and sold to third parties, and the
    non-recyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators.

Sales and
    Marketing

We seek to provide quality services that will enable us to
    maintain high levels of customer satisfaction. We derive our
    business from a broad customer base, which we believe will
    enable us to experience stable growth. We focus our marketing
    efforts on continuing and expanding business with existing
    customers, as well as attracting new customers.

We employ approximately 1,200 sales and marketing employees. Our
    sales and marketing strategy is to provide high-quality,
    comprehensive solid waste collection, recycling, transfer and
    disposal services to our customers at competitive prices. We
    target potential customers of all sizes, from small quantity
    generators to large “Fortune 500” companies and
    municipalities.

Most of our marketing activity is local in nature. However, we
    also provide a National Accounts program in response to the
    needs of some of our national and regional customers. Our
    National Accounts program is designed to provide the best total
    solution to our customers’ evolving waste management needs
    in an environmentally responsible manner. We partner with our
    national clients to reach their sustainability goals, optimize
    waste streams, balance equipment and service intervals and
    provide customized reporting. The National Accounts program
    centralizes services to effectively manage customer needs, while
    helping minimize procurement costs. With our extended geographic
    reach, our national program



effectively serves 40 states and Puerto Rico. As industry
    leaders, our mission is to utilize our strengths and expertise
    to exceed customer expectations by consistently delivering the
    best national program available.

We generally do not change the tradenames of the local
    businesses we acquire, and therefore we do not operate
    nationally under any one mark or tradename.

Customers

We provide services to commercial, industrial, municipal and
    residential customers. No one customer has individually
    accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of
    our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Entry into our
    business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry
    requires substantial amounts of capital and managerial
    experience.

Competition in the non-hazardous solid waste industry comes from
    a few large, national publicly owned companies, including Waste
    Management, Inc. (Waste), several regional publicly and
    privately owned solid waste companies, and thousands of small
    privately owned companies. In any given market, competitors may
    have larger operations and greater resources. In addition to
    national and regional firms and numerous local companies, we
    compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or
    disposal operations. These municipalities may have financial
    advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and tax-exempt
    financing.

We compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of
    price and the quality of our services. From time to time, our
    competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort
    to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal
    contract. Our ability to increase prices in certain markets may
    be impacted by the pricing policies of our competitors. This may
    have an impact on our future revenue and profitability.

Seasonality and
    Severe Weather

Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement
    or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste
    collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding
    compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste,
    reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or
    delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and
    other facilities.

Regulation

Our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of
    federal, state and local requirements that regulate the
    environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use.
    Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals are
    generally required for landfills and transfer stations, certain
    solid waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and other
    facilities that we own or operate, and these permits are subject
    to revocation, modification and renewal in certain
    circumstances. Federal, state and local laws and regulations
    vary, but generally govern wastewater or stormwater discharges,
    air emissions, the handling, transportation, treatment, storage
    and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the
    remediation of contamination associated with the release or
    threatened release of hazardous substances. These laws and
    regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers
    of enforcement, which include the ability to revoke or decline
    to renew any of our operating permits, obtain injunctions, or
    impose fines or penalties in the case of violations, including
    criminal penalties. The U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) and various other federal, state and local
    environmental, public and occupational health and safety
    agencies and authorities administer these regulations.

We strive to conduct our operations in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations. However, in the existing
    climate of heightened environmental concerns, from time to time,
    we have been issued citations or notices from governmental
    authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for
    remedial work



and related activities at various landfills and other
    facilities. There is no assurance that citations and notices
    will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory
    compliance efforts. We have established final capping, closure,
    post-closure and remediation liabilities that we believe, based
    on currently available information, will be adequate to cover
    our current estimates of regulatory costs. However, we cannot
    assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves.

Federal Regulation.

The following summarizes
    the primary environmental, public and occupational health and
    safety-related statutes of the United States that affect our
    facilities and operations:

(1)

The Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, including the
    Resource Conservation and Recovery Act

(RCRA). RCRA
    establishes a framework for regulating the handling,
    transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and
    non-hazardous solid waste, and requires states to develop
    programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary
    landfills.

Subtitle D of RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the
    disposal of municipal solid waste. Regulations under Subtitle D
    currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management
    criteria and guidelines, including location restrictions,
    facility design and operating criteria, final capping, closure
    and post-closure requirements, financial assurance standards,
    groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action
    standards, many of which had not commonly been in effect or
    enforced in the past in connection with municipal solid waste
    landfills. Each state was required to submit to the EPA a permit
    program designed to implement Subtitle D regulations by
    April 9, 1993. All of the states in which we operate have
    implemented permit programs pursuant to RCRA and Subtitle D.
    These state permit programs may include landfill requirements
    which are more stringent than those of Subtitle D. Our failure
    to comply with the environmental requirements of federal, state
    and local authorities at any of our locations may lead to
    temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit.

All of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill
    development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed
    Subtitle D requirements. Operating and design criteria for
    existing operations have been modified to comply with these
    regulations. Compliance with Subtitle D regulations has resulted
    in increased costs and may in the future require substantial
    additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally
    associated with our waste management activities.

(2)

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980, as amended

(CERCLA). CERCLA, among
    other things, provides for the cleanup of sites from which there
    is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into
    the environment. CERCLA may impose strict joint and several
    liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural
    resources upon current owners and operators of a site, parties
    who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous
    substances were disposed of, parties who transported the
    hazardous substances to a site and parties who arranged for the
    disposal of the hazardous substances at a site. Under the
    authority of CERCLA and its implementing regulations, detailed
    requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and
    remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances
    have been or are threatened to be released into the environment.
    Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the existence or
    disposal of only “hazardous wastes” but can also be
    based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700
    “substances” characterized by the EPA as
    “hazardous,” many of which may be found in common
    household waste.

Among other things, CERCLA authorizes the federal government to
    investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances
    have been or are threatened to be released into the environment
    or to order (or offer an opportunity to) persons potentially
    liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so. In
    addition, the EPA has established a National Priorities List of
    sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened
    to be released and which require investigation or cleanup.

Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the intentional
    disposal of hazardous waste. It can be founded upon the release
    or threatened release, even as a result of unintentional,
    non-negligent or lawful action, of thousands of hazardous
    substances, including very small quantities of such



substances. Thus, even if we have never knowingly transported or
    received hazardous waste as such, it is possible that one or
    more hazardous substances may have been deposited or
    “released” at landfills or other properties owned by
    third parties where we have transported to and disposed of waste
    or at our landfills or at other properties which we currently
    own or operate or may have owned or operated. Therefore, we
    could be liable under CERCLA for the cost of cleaning up such
    hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural
    resources, even if those substances were deposited at our
    facilities before we acquired or operated them. The costs of a
    CERCLA cleanup can be very expensive. Given the difficulty of
    obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability, such
    liability could have a material impact on our business,
    financial condition or results of operations.

(3)

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended

(the Clean Water Act). This act regulates the discharge of
    pollutants from a variety of sources, including solid waste
    disposal sites, into streams, rivers and other waters of the
    United States. Point source runoff from our landfills and
    transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters must be
    covered by discharge permits that generally require us to
    conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under certain
    circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those
    discharges. Storm water discharge regulations under the Clean
    Water Act require a permit for certain construction activities
    and discharges from industrial operations and facilities, which
    may affect our operations. If a landfill or transfer station
    discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly
    owned treatment works, the facility must comply with discharge
    limits imposed by that treatment works. In addition, states may
    adopt groundwater protection programs under the Clean Water Act
    or the Safe Drinking Water Act that could affect solid waste
    landfills. Furthermore, development which alters or affects
    wetlands must generally be permitted prior to such development
    commencing, and certain mitigation requirements may be required
    by the permitting agencies.

(4)

The Clean Air Act, as amended

(the Clean Air Act). The
    Clean Air Act imposes limitations on emissions from various
    sources, including landfills. In March 1996, the EPA promulgated
    regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills
    to install landfill gas monitoring systems. These regulations
    apply to landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction
    or modification on or after May 30, 1991, and, principally,
    to landfills that can accommodate 2.5 million cubic meters
    or more of municipal solid waste. The regulations apply whether
    the landfill is active or closed. The date by which each
    affected landfill is required to have a gas collection and
    control system installed and made operational varies depending
    on calculated emission rates at the landfill. Many state
    regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems
    for the collection and control of certain landfill gas.

(5)

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended

(OSHA). OSHA authorizes the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor to
    promulgate occupational safety and health standards. A number of
    these standards, including standards for notices of hazardous
    chemicals and the handling of asbestos, apply to our facilities
    and operations.

State and Local Regulation.

Each state in
    which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing
    solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most
    cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and
    liabilities for such matters. States also have adopted
    regulations governing the design, operation, maintenance and
    closure of landfills and transfer stations. Some counties,
    municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar
    laws and regulations. Our facilities and operations are likely
    to be subject to these types of requirements. In addition, our
    solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected
    by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of
    solid waste reduction and recycling programs. For example,
    several states have enacted laws that require counties or
    municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce, through
    solid waste planning, composting, recycling or other programs,
    the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills. Additionally,
    laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste
    in solid waste landfills, including yard waste, newspapers,
    beverage containers, unshredded tires, lead-acid batteries and
    household appliances, have been promulgated in several states
    and are being considered in others. Legislative and regulatory
    measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source
    and waste recycling also are or have been under consideration by
    the U.S. Congress and the EPA, respectively.



In order to construct, expand and operate a landfill, one or
    more construction or operating permits, as well as zoning and
    land use approvals, must be obtained. These permits and
    approvals may be difficult and time-consuming to obtain and to
    operate in compliance with, are often opposed by neighboring
    landowners and citizens’ groups, may be subject to periodic
    renewal, and are subject to modification, non-renewal and
    revocation by the issuing agency. In connection with our
    acquisition of existing landfills, it may be and on occasion has
    been necessary for us to expend considerable time, effort and
    money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with
    applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals
    necessary to increase their capacity.

Many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks
    which are generally used to store petroleum-based products.
    These tanks are generally subject to federal, state and local
    laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing,
    upgrading, closure and removal, and that, in the event of leaks,
    require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated. We
    believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet
    all applicable regulations. If underground storage tanks we own
    or operate leak, we could be liable for response costs and, if
    the leakage migrates onto the property of others, we could be
    liable for damages to third parties. We are unaware of facts
    indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to
    underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Finally, with regard to our solid waste transportation
    operations, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface
    Transportation Board and are regulated by the Federal Highway
    Administration, Office of Motor Carriers, and by regulatory
    agencies in states that regulate such matters. Various states
    and local government authorities have enacted or promulgated, or
    are considering enacting or promulgating, laws and regulations
    that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across
    state, county, or other jurisdiction lines. In 1978, the
    U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a law that restricts the
    importation of

out-of-state

solid waste was unconstitutional; however, states have attempted
    to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and
    implicated by that ruling. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled that
    a flow control law, which attempted to restrict solid waste from
    leaving its place of generation, imposed an impermissible burden
    upon interstate commerce, and, therefore, was unconstitutional.
    In 2007, the Supreme Court upheld the right of a local
    government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly owned
    waste facility. A number of county and other local jurisdictions
    have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the
    free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries.
    Other governments may enact similar regulations in the future.
    These regulations may, in some cases, cause a decline in volumes
    of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may
    increase our costs of disposal, thereby adversely affecting our
    operations.

We have established liabilities for landfill and environmental
    costs, which include landfill site final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs. We periodically reassess such costs based on
    various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and
    the technical requirements of Subtitle D of RCRA and adjust our
    rates used to expense final capping, closure and post-closure
    costs accordingly. Based on current information and regulatory
    requirements, we believe that our liabilities recorded for such
    landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate. However,
    environmental laws may change, and there can be no assurance
    that our recorded liabilities will be adequate to cover
    requirements under existing or new environmental laws and
    regulations, future changes or interpretations of existing laws
    and regulations, or the identification of adverse environmental
    conditions previously unknown to us.

Liability
    Insurance and Bonding

The nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities
    arising out of our operations, including possible damages to the
    environment. Such potential liabilities could involve, for
    example, claims for remediation costs, personal injury, property
    damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be
    held responsible for the escape of harmful materials; claims of
    employees, customers or third parties for personal injury or
    property damage occurring in the course of our operations; or
    claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning
    or performance of work. We could also be subject to fines and
    civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged
    violations of regulatory requirements. Because



of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages,
    liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be
    significant. Our solid waste operations have third party
    environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those
    required by permit regulations, subject to certain limitations
    and exclusions. However, we cannot assure you that such
    environmental liability insurance would be adequate, in scope or
    amount, in the event of a major loss, nor can we assure you that
    we would continue to carry excess environmental liability
    insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry
    make such coverage costs prohibitive.

We have general liability, vehicle liability, employment
    practices liability, pollution liability, directors and officers
    liability, workers’ compensation and employer’s
    liability coverage, as well as umbrella liability policies to
    provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in
    these primary policies. We also carry property insurance.
    Although we try to operate safely and prudently and while we
    have, subject to limitations and exclusions, substantial
    liability insurance, no assurance can be given that we will not
    be exposed to uninsured liabilities which could have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results
    of operations and cash flows.

Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. Claims in excess of
    self-insurance levels are fully insured subject to policy
    limits. Accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial
    estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not
    reported. Due to the variable condition of the insurance market,
    we have experienced, and may continue to experience in the
    future, increased self-insurance retention levels and increased
    premiums. As we assume more risk for self-insurance through
    higher retention levels, we may experience more variability in
    our self-insurance reserves and expense.

In the normal course of business, we may be required to post
    performance bonds, insurance policies, letters of credit, or
    cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with
    municipal residential collection contracts, the operation,
    closure or post-closure of landfills, environmental remediation,
    environmental permits, and business licenses and permits as a
    financial guarantee of our performance. To date, we have
    satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash
    or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters
    of credit, insurance policies or surety bonds.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we employed approximately
    35,000 full-time employees, approximately 27% of whom were
    covered by collective bargaining agreements. From time to time,
    our operating locations may experience union organizing efforts.
    We have not historically experienced any significant work
    stoppages. We currently have no disputes or bargaining
    circumstances that we believe could cause significant
    disruptions in our business. Our management believes that we
    have good relations with our employees.

Compensation

We believe that our compensation program effectively aligns our
    field and corporate management team with our overall goal of
    generating increasing amounts of free cash flow while achieving
    targeted earnings and returns on invested capital. This is done
    by utilizing simple and measurable metrics on which incentive
    pay is based. At the field level, these metrics are based on
    free cash flow, earnings and return on invested capital for each
    manager’s geographic area of responsibility. Great effort
    is taken to ensure that these goals agree with our overall
    goals. Incentive compensation at the corporate level is based on
    the obtainment of our overall goals. Furthermore, in conjunction
    with the merger with Allied, we have developed integration
    metrics to be achieved by our executive management team and key
    employees based upon targeted annual run-rate synergies of
    approximately $150.0 million by the end of 2010. In
    addition, certain field and corporate employees also participate
    in a long-term incentive program. We believe this program aligns
    our short- and long-term goals and helps ensure that our
    long-term success is not sacrificed for the obtainment of
    short-term goals.

RISK
    FACTORS

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

contains certain forward-looking information about us that is
    intended to be covered by the safe harbor for
    “forward-looking statements” provided by the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
    statements are statements that are not historical facts. Words
    such as “expect,” “will,” “may,”
    “anticipate,” “plan,” “estimate,”
    “intend,” “should,” “can,”
    “likely,” “could” and similar expressions
    are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These
    statements include statements about the expected benefits of the
    merger, our plans, strategies and prospects. Forward-looking
    statements are not guarantees of performance. These statements
    are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our
    management and are subject to risk and uncertainties, including
    the risks set forth below in these risk factors, that could
    cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
    in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information
    and statements.

In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors,
    the results anticipated by the forward-looking statements
    discussed in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

may not occur. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
    on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the
    date hereof. Except to the extent required by applicable law or
    regulation, we undertake no obligation to update or publish
    revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or
    circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence
    of unanticipated events.

We may
    experience difficulties integrating Allied’s
    business.

Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger with Allied
    will depend significantly on whether we can integrate
    Allied’s business in an efficient and effective manner.
    Although Republic and Allied were able to conduct some planning
    regarding the integration of the two companies prior to the
    merger, we might not have determined the exact nature of how the
    businesses and operations of the two companies will be combined
    after the merger. The actual integration may result in
    additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits
    of the integration plan may not be realized. We may not be able
    to accomplish the integration process smoothly, successfully or
    on a timely basis. The necessity of coordinating geographically
    separated organizations, information systems and facilities, and
    addressing possible differences in business backgrounds,
    corporate cultures and management philosophies, may increase the
    difficulties of integration. We and Allied operate numerous
    systems and controls, including those



involving information management, purchasing, accounting and
    finance, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll and
    regulatory compliance. The integration of operations following
    the merger will require the dedication of significant management
    and external resources, which may temporarily distract
    management’s attention from our

day-to-day

business and be costly. Employee uncertainty and lack of focus
    during the integration process may also disrupt our business.
    The inability of our management to successfully and timely
    integrate the operations of Republic and Allied could have a
    material adverse effect on the business and results of
    operations of the combined company.

We may not realize the anticipated synergies and related
    benefits from the merger with Allied fully or within the timing
    anticipated.

We entered into the merger agreement with Allied because we
    believe that the merger will be beneficial to our stockholders
    primarily as a result of the anticipated synergies resulting
    from the combined operations. We may not be able to achieve the
    anticipated operating and cost synergies or the long-term
    strategic benefits of the merger fully or within the timing
    anticipated. For example, elimination of duplicative costs may
    not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated. For
    at least the first year after an acquisition, and possibly
    longer, the benefits from the acquisition will be offset by the
    costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations. The
    inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the
    anticipated synergies or other benefits of the merger, or our
    encountering delays in the integration process (which may delay
    the timing of such synergies or other benefits), could have a
    material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.

Future expenses resulting from the application of the
    purchase method of accounting may adversely affect the market
    value of our common stock following the merger.

In accordance with GAAP, we are considered the acquirer of
    Allied for accounting purposes. We have accounted for the merger
    using the purchase method of accounting. There may be future
    expenses related to the acquisition that are required to be
    recorded in our earnings that could adversely affect the market
    value of our common stock following the completion of the
    merger. Under the purchase method of accounting, we have
    allocated the total purchase price to the assets (including
    identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities acquired from
    Allied based on their fair values as of the effective date of
    the merger, and we have recorded the excess of the purchase
    price over those fair values as goodwill. For certain tangible
    and intangible assets, and for our capping, closure and
    post-closure asset retirement obligations, revaluing them to
    their fair values as of the merger completion date will result
    in additional depreciation, depletion and amortization and
    accretion expense that will exceed the combined amounts recorded
    by Republic and Allied prior to the merger. Interest expense
    will increase significantly as a result of revaluing
    Allied’s debt and other long-term liabilities, including,
    for example, self-insurance reserves and environmental
    liabilities. In addition, as discussed in the following risk
    factor, to the extent the value of goodwill or other intangible
    assets were to become impaired after the merger, we may incur
    material non-cash charges to our results of operations.

Our goodwill
    and other intangible assets may become impaired, which could
    result in material non-cash charges to our results of
    operations.

We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible
    assets resulting from the merger with Allied. At least annually,
    or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a
    potential impairment in the carrying value as defined by GAAP,
    we evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair
    values of each of our operating segments. The estimated fair
    value of our operating segments could change if there are
    changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates,
    capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows or market
    capitalization, or in general economic conditions. Impairments
    of goodwill or other intangible assets could require material
    non-cash charges to our results of operations.



We may incur significant unexpected transaction- and
    integration-related costs in connection with the merger.

We have incurred and may continue to incur costs associated with
    combining the operations of Republic and Allied, including
    charges and payments to some employees pursuant to “change
    in control” contractual obligations. The substantial
    majority of these expenses resulting from the merger are
    comprised of transaction costs related to the merger, facilities
    and systems consolidation costs, and employee-related costs.
    Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the
    integration of the two companies’ businesses or may result
    from the application of purchase accounting used to effectuate
    the merger. The elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the
    realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of
    the businesses, may not offset incremental transaction- and
    other integration-related costs in the near term.

The timing of and proceeds received from the mandatory
    divestiture of certain assets of the company may result in
    additional expenditures of money and resources or reduce the
    benefit of the merger.

Completion of the merger is predicated on divesting of certain
    assets as required by the Antitrust Division of the DOJ under
    the HSR Act. In February 2009, we announced an agreement with
    Waste Connections, Inc. to sell them a majority of the assets we
    are required to divest. The assets being divested to Waste
    Connections include six municipal solid waste landfills, six
    collection operations and three transfer stations across seven
    markets. This transaction is subject to closing conditions
    regarding due diligence, regulatory approval and other customary
    matters. Closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of
    2009. However, the timing of and proceeds we will receive from
    the divestiture to Waste Connections and the divestiture of the
    remaining assets as required by the DOJ cannot be predicted.
    Delays in divesting of these assets may result in additional
    expenditures of money and resources which would reduce the
    financial benefit we expect from the merger. In addition, the
    amount of proceeds received from such divestitures cannot be
    guaranteed. An unanticipated shortfall in proceeds may limit our
    ability to execute our financial strategy, including repaying
    our debt.

We have substantial indebtedness as a result of the
    merger, which may limit our financial flexibility.

As of December 31, 2008, we have approximately
    $7.7 billion in total debt outstanding. This amount of
    indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our
    financial flexibility to access additional capital and make
    capital expenditures and other investments in our business, to
    withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases, to
    plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry,
    and to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants
    of our debt instruments. Further, our ability to comply with the
    financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments
    may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or
    other events that are beyond our control. If we do not comply
    with these covenants and restrictions, we may be required to
    take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures,
    reducing dividends, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing
    all or part of our existing debt, or seeking additional equity
    capital.

The downturn
    in the U.S. economy may have an adverse impact on our operating
    results.

A weak economy generally results in decreases in the volumes of
    waste generated. In the past, weakness in the U.S. economy
    has had a negative effect on our operating results, including
    decreases in revenue and operating cash flows. Previous economic
    slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection
    business servicing the manufacturing and construction industries
    and our proceeds from sales of recycled commodities. As a result
    of the global economic crisis, we may experience the negative
    effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer
    turnover as well. There can be no assurance that worsening
    economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will
    not have a significant adverse impact on our results of
    operations or cash flows. Further, there can be no assurance
    that an improvement in economic conditions will result in an
    immediate, if at all positive, improvement in our results of
    operations or cash flows.



The downturn in the U.S. economy may expose us to credit
    risk for amounts due from governmental agencies, large national
    accounts and others.

The weak U.S. economy has reduced the amount of taxes
    collected by various governmental agencies. We provide services
    to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities.
    These governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties
    resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be
    unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us. In addition, the
    weak economy may cause other customers, including our large
    national accounts, to suffer financial difficulties and
    ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us.
    This could have a negative impact on our results of operations
    and cash flows.

The downturn in the U.S. economy and in the financial
    markets could expose us to counter-party risk associated with
    our derivatives.

To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in various commodities
    and interest rates, we have entered into a number of derivative
    agreements. These derivative agreements require us or the
    counter-party to such agreements to make payments to the other
    party if the price of certain commodities or interest rates
    exceed a specified amount. A continued downturn in the
    U.S. economy or in the financial markets could adversely
    impact the financial stability of the counter-parties with which
    we do business, potentially limiting their ability to fulfill
    their obligations under our derivative agreements. This could
    have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash
    flows.

The waste industry is highly competitive and includes
    competitors that may have greater financial and operational
    resources, flexibility to reduce prices and other competitive
    advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete
    effectively.

We principally compete with large national waste management
    companies, municipalities and numerous regional and local
    companies for collection and disposal accounts. Competition for
    collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality
    of services. Competition for landfill business is primarily
    based on disposal costs, geographic location and quality of
    operations. Some of our competitors may have greater financial
    and operational resources than us. Many counties and
    municipalities that operate their own waste collection and
    disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or
    tax-exempt financing. Our ability to obtain solid waste volume
    for our landfills may also be limited by the fact that some
    major collection companies also own or operate landfills to
    which they send their waste. In markets in which we do not own
    or operate a landfill, our collection operations may operate at
    a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors. As a result of
    these factors, we may have difficulty competing effectively from
    time to time or in certain markets. If we were to lower prices
    to address these competitive issues, it could negatively impact
    our revenue growth and profitability.

Price
    increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased
    costs and may cause us to lose volume.

We compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of
    price and the quality of services. In addition, we seek to
    secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs
    (including fuel costs), to improve operating margins and to
    obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets
    such as our landfills. From time to time, our competitors may
    reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand their
    market share. Contractual, general economic or market-specific
    conditions may also limit our ability to raise prices. As a
    result of these factors, we may be unable to offset increases in
    costs, improve our operating margins and obtain adequate
    investment returns through price increases. We may also lose
    volume to lower-cost competitors.

Increases in the cost of fuel or oil will increase our
    operating expenses, and there can be no assurance that we will
    be able to recover fuel or oil cost increases from our
    customers.

Our operations are dependent on fuel to run our collection and
    transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection,
    transfer, and disposal. We buy fuel in the open market. Fuel
    prices are unpredictable and can



fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control,
    including geopolitical developments, actions by the Organization
    of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and other oil and gas
    producers, supply and demand for oil and gas, war, terrorism and
    unrest in oil-producing countries, and regional production
    patterns. We may not be able to offset such volatility through
    fuel surcharges. For example, our fuel costs were
    $235.3 million in 2008, representing 9.7% of our cost of
    operations compared to $180.3 million in 2007, representing
    9.0% of our cost of operations. This increase primarily reflects
    an increase in the price of fuel.

In addition, regulations affecting the type of fuel our trucks
    use are changing and could materially increase the cost and
    consumption of our fuel. Our operations also require the use of
    certain petroleum-based products (such as liners at our
    landfills) whose costs may vary with the price of oil. An
    increase in the price of oil could increase the cost of those
    products, which would increase our operating and capital costs.
    We are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges
    from our vendors.

Fluctuations
    in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may
    adversely affect our revenue, operating income and cash
    flows.

We process recyclable materials such as paper, cardboard,
    plastics, aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties.
    Our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or
    market requirements for recyclable materials. The resale and
    purchase prices of, and market demand for, recyclable materials
    can be volatile due to changes in economic conditions and
    numerous other factors beyond our control. These fluctuations
    may affect our future revenue, operating income and cash flows.

Adverse weather conditions may limit our operations and
    increase the costs of collection and disposal.

Our collection and landfill operations could be adversely
    impacted by extended periods of inclement weather, which could
    increase the volume of waste collected under our existing
    contracts (without corresponding compensation), may interfere
    with collection and landfill operations, delay the development
    of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by
    our customers. In addition, weather conditions may result in the
    temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly
    affect our operating results in the affected regions during
    those periods.

We currently have matters pending with the DOJ and
    Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which could result in large cash
    expenditures and could have a material adverse impact on our
    operating results and cash flows.

As a result of the merger with Allied, we are currently under
    examination by the IRS with regard to Allied’s federal
    income tax returns for tax years 2000 through 2006.

An Allied subsidiary, Browning-Ferris Industries, LLC (BFI,
    f/k/a Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc.), currently has a tax
    matter in litigation for the tax years ended September 30,
    1997 through July 30, 1999 related to a capital loss
    deduction. A portion of this loss was subsequently carried
    forward to Allied’s 1999 through 2002 tax years. We are
    currently engaged in two refund suits related to this matter.
    The BFI tax years September 30, 1997 through July 30,
    1999 are currently before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims,
    while the Allied tax year ended December 31, 1999 is
    currently before the U.S. District Court of Arizona. All
    future tax years impacted by the BFI capital loss deduction and
    subsequent carryforward by Allied are presently in various
    stages of the IRS examination or appeals process. Any resolution
    or final determination on the merits for an earlier tax year
    will also resolve the issue for all subsequent periods.

During its examination of Allied’s 2002 tax year, the IRS
    asserted that a 2002 redemption of four partnership interests in
    waste-to-energy businesses should have been recharacterized as
    disguised sale transactions. This issue is currently before the
    Appeals Division of the IRS.

For both of the matters described above, the potential tax and
    interest through December 31, 2008 (to the extent unpaid)
    has been fully reserved for in our consolidated balance sheet. A
    disallowance would not



materially affect our consolidated results of operations;
    however, a deficiency payment would adversely impact our cash
    flow in the period the payment was made. In addition, for the
    capital loss deduction matter described above, the potential
    penalty and penalty-related interest through December 31,
    2008 has also been fully reserved for in our consolidated
    balance sheet. The successful assertion by the IRS of penalty
    and penalty-related interest in this matter would not materially
    affect our consolidated results of operations; however, a
    payment of penalty and penalty-related interest would adversely
    impact our cash flows in the period such payment was made. The
    accrual of additional interest charges through the time these
    matters are resolved will affect our consolidated results of
    operations. In addition, the successful assertion by the IRS of
    penalty and penalty-related interest in connection with
    Allied’s 2002 exchange of partnership interests could have
    a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
    operations and cash flows.

Additionally, during its examination of Allied’s 2000
    through 2003 tax years, the IRS proposed that certain landfill
    costs be allocated to the collection and control of methane gas
    that is naturally emitted from landfills. The IRS’ position
    is that the methane gas emitted by a landfill constitutes a
    joint product resulting from landfill operations and, therefore,
    associated costs should not be expensed until the methane gas is
    sold or otherwise disposed. We believe we have several
    meritorious defenses, including the fact that methane gas is not
    actively produced for sale by us but rather arises naturally in
    the context of providing disposal services. Therefore, we
    believe that the resolution of this issue will not have a
    material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

For additional information on these matters, see Note 10,

Income Taxes,

to our consolidated financial statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Other matters may also arise in the course of tax audits that
    could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows.

We may be
    unable to execute our financial strategy.

Our ability to execute our financial strategy is dependent on
    our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior
    debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon a number of
    factors, many of which are beyond our control. There can be no
    assurance that we will be able to maintain our investment grade
    ratings in the future. Our interest expense would increase and
    our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be
    adversely affected should we fail to maintain investment grade
    ratings.

Our financial strategy is also dependent on our ability to
    generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing
    business, fund internal growth, acquire other solid waste
    businesses, pay dividends, reduce indebtedness and minimize
    borrowings, and take other actions to enhance shareholder value.
    There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
    executing our broad-based pricing program, that we will generate
    sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy, that we
    will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or that
    we will be able to increase the amount of such dividends.

A downgrade in
    our bond ratings could adversely affect our liquidity by
    increasing the cost of debt and financial assurance
    instruments.

While downgrades of our bond ratings may not have an immediate
    impact on our cost of debt or liquidity, they may impact our
    cost of debt and liquidity over the near to medium term. If the
    rating agencies downgrade our debt, this may increase the
    interest rate we must pay to issue new debt, and it may even
    make it prohibitively expensive for us to issue new debt. If our
    debt ratings are downgraded, future access to financial
    assurance markets at a reasonable cost, or at all, also may be
    adversely impacted.



The solid waste industry is a capital-intensive industry
    and the amount we spend on capital expenditures may exceed
    current expectations, which could require us to obtain
    additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to
    grow our business.

Our ability to remain competitive and to grow and expand our
    operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and
    access to capital. If our capital efficiency programs are unable
    to offset the impact of inflation and business growth, it may be
    necessary to increase the amount we spend. Additionally, if we
    make acquisitions or further expand our operations, the amount
    we expend on capital, capping, closure, post-closure and
    environmental remediation expenditures will increase. Our cash
    needs will also increase if the expenditures for capping,
    closure, post-closure and remediation activities increase above
    our current estimates, which may occur over a long period due to
    changes in federal, state or local government requirements and
    other factors beyond our control. Increases in expenditures
    would negatively impact our cash flows.

Further, federal regulations have tightened the emission
    standards on class A vehicles, which includes the
    collection vehicles we purchase. As a result, we could
    experience an increase in capital costs and a reduction in
    operating efficiency. This could also cause an increase in
    vehicle operating costs. We may reduce the number of vehicles we
    purchase until manufacturers adopt the new standards to increase
    efficiency.

We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or
    to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which
    could decrease our revenue and increase our costs.

There can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain or
    maintain the permits we require to operate our business because
    permits to operate non-hazardous solid waste landfills and to
    expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become
    more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. Permits
    often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and
    compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and
    other regulations. These permits are also often subject to
    resistance from citizen or other groups and other political
    pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent
    landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a
    permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits
    under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which
    we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for
    environmental damage. Responding to these challenges has, at
    times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with
    establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities.
    In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval
    may prohibit us from establishing new facilities, maintaining
    permits for our facilities or expanding existing facilities. Our
    failure to obtain the required permits to operate our
    non-hazardous solid waste landfills could have a material
    adverse impact on our future results of operations or cash
    flows. In addition, we may have to dispose collected waste at
    landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long
    distances at a higher cost to one of our landfills, either of
    which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs.

The waste industry is subject to extensive government
    regulation, and existing or future regulations may restrict our
    operations, increase our costs of operations or require us to
    make additional capital expenditures.

If we inadequately accrue for landfill capping, closure
    and post-closure costs, our financial condition and results of
    operations may be adversely affected.

A landfill must be closed and capped, and post-closure
    maintenance commenced once the permitted capacity of the
    landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized.
    We have significant financial obligations relating to capping,
    closure and post-closure costs at our existing owned or operated
    landfills, and will have material financial obligations with
    respect to any future owned or operated disposal facilities. We
    establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with
    capping, closure and post-closure financial obligations. We
    could underestimate such accruals, and our financial obligations
    for capping, closure or post-closure costs could exceed the
    amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable
    pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose. Such a
    shortfall could result in significant



unanticipated charges to income. Additionally, if a landfill is
    required to be closed earlier than expected or its remaining
    airspace is reduced for any other reason, the accruals for
    capping, closure and post-closure could be required to be
    accelerated, which could have a material adverse impact our
    results of operations and cash flows.

We cannot assure you that we will continue to operate our
    landfills at currently estimated volumes due to the use of
    alternatives to landfill disposal caused by state requirements
    or voluntary initiatives.

Most of the states in which we operate landfills require
    counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to
    reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through
    waste planning, composting and recycling, or other programs.
    Some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the
    source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes,
    such as yard waste, at landfills. Although such actions are
    useful in protecting our environment, these actions, as well as
    voluntary private initiatives by customers to reduce waste or
    seek disposal alternatives, have and may in the future reduce
    the volume of waste going to landfills in certain areas. If this
    occurs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
    operate our landfills at their current estimated volumes or
    charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the
    decrease in demand for such services.

The possibility of landfill and transfer station site
    development projects, expansion projects or pending acquisitions
    not being completed or certain other events could result in a
    material charge to income.

We capitalize certain expenditures relating to development,
    expansion and other projects. If a facility or operation is
    permanently shut down or determined to be impaired, or a
    development or expansion project is not completed or is
    determined to be impaired, we will charge any unamortized
    capitalized expenditures to income relating to such facility or
    project that we are unable to recover through sale, transfer or
    otherwise. In future periods, we may incur charges against
    earnings in accordance with this policy, or other events may
    cause impairments. Such charges could have a material adverse
    impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to costly environmental regulations and
    flow-control regulations that may affect our operating margins,
    restrict our operations and subject us to additional
    liability.

Complying with laws and regulations governing the use,
    treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous
    wastes and materials, air quality, water quality and the
    remediation of contamination associated with the release of
    hazardous substances is costly. Laws and regulations often
    require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify
    landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill.
    There can be no assurance that we will be able to implement
    price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with
    these laws and regulations. In addition, environmental
    regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for
    capping, closure and post-closure, and environmental and
    remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us
    to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such
    purposes.

Our collection, transfer, and landfill operations are, and may
    in the future continue to be, affected by state or local laws or
    regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste
    across state, county or other jurisdictional lines. Such laws
    and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting
    in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate
    disposal.

In addition to the costs of complying with environmental
    regulations, we incur costs to defend against litigation brought
    by government agencies and private parties who may allege we are
    in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws
    and regulations, or who assert claims alleging environmental
    damage, personal injury or property damage. As a result, we may
    be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures, or we
    may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked. A
    significant judgment



against us, the loss of a significant permit or license, or the
    imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse
    impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

We establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated
    with our environmental obligations. We could underestimate such
    accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued.
    Such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated
    charges to income.

We may have
    potential environmental liabilities that are not covered by our
    insurance. Changes  in insurance markets may also impact our
    financial results.

We may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the
    environment as a result of our operations. We maintain high
    deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage.
    If we were to incur substantial liability for environmental
    damage, our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such
    liability. This could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Also, due to the variable condition of the insurance market, we
    may experience future increases in self-insurance levels as a
    result of increased retention levels and increased premiums. As
    we assume more risk for self-insurance through higher retention
    levels, we may experience more variability in our self-insurance
    reserves and expense.

Despite our
    efforts, we may incur additional hazardous substances liability
    in excess of amounts  presently known and accrued.

We are a potentially responsible party at many sites under
    CERCLA, which provides for the remediation of contaminated
    facilities and imposes strict, joint and several liability for
    the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a
    facility at which there has been a release or a threatened
    release of a “hazardous substance,” on parties who
    were site owners and operators at the time hazardous
    substance(s) was disposed of, and on persons who arrange for the
    disposal of such substances at the facility (i.e., generators of
    the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site).
    Hundreds of substances are defined as “hazardous”
    under CERCLA and their presence, even in minute amounts, can
    result in substantial liability. Notwithstanding our efforts to
    comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and
    receiving hazardous substances, we may have additional liability
    under CERCLA or similar laws in excess of our current reserves
    because such substances may be present in waste collected by us
    or disposed of in our landfills, or in waste collected,
    transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have
    acquired. Actual costs for these liabilities could be
    significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these
    purposes, which could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Currently
    pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could
    result in material  adverse consequences, including judgments or
    settlements.

We are, and from time to time become, involved in lawsuits,
    regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal
    proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business.
    Many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual
    and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and
    complexities. The timing of the final resolutions to these types
    of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible
    outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse
    judgments or settlements, either of which could require
    substantial payments, adversely affecting our results of
    operations and cash flows.

We may be
    unable to manage our growth effectively.

Our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial,
    operational and management resources. In order to continue our
    growth, we may need to add administrative and other personnel,
    and will need to make additional investments in operations and
    systems. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find
    and train qualified personnel, or do so on a timely basis, or
    expand our operations and systems to the extent, and in the
    time, required.



We may be
    unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy.

Our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on
    our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition
    candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate
    acquired operations into our business. The consolidation of our
    operations with those of acquired companies may present
    significant challenges to our management. In addition,
    competition among our competitors for acquisition candidates may
    prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates. As
    such, we cannot assure you that:

§

Desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified,

§

We will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified,

§

We will effectively consolidate companies we acquire, or

§

Any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings.

If any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our
    growth strategy, our growth prospects could be adversely
    affected.

Businesses we
    acquire may have undisclosed liabilities.

In pursuing our acquisition strategy, our investigations of the
    acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed
    liabilities of the acquisition candidates. If we acquire a
    company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental,
    remediation or contractual, as a successor owner we may be
    responsible for such undisclosed liabilities. We expect to try
    to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by obtaining
    indemnification from each of the sellers of the acquired
    companies, by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase
    price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only
    specified assets. However, there can be no assurance that we
    will be able to obtain indemnifications or that they will be
    enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or
    duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising
    from our acquisitions.

Our
    consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and
    assumptions that may differ from actual results.

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with GAAP and necessarily include amounts based on
    estimates and assumptions made by management. Actual results
    could differ from these amounts. Significant items requiring
    management to make subjective or complex judgements about
    matters that are inherently uncertain include the carrying value
    of long-lived assets, the depletion and amortization of landfill
    development costs, accruals for final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs, valuation allowances for accounts receivable
    and deferred tax assets, liabilities for potential litigation,
    claims and assessments, and liabilities for environmental
    remediation, employee benefit and pension plans, deferred taxes,
    uncertain tax positions and self-insurance.

There can be no assurance that the liabilities recorded for
    landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the
    requirements of existing environmental regulations, future
    changes to or interpretations of existing regulations, or the
    identification of adverse environmental conditions previously
    unknown to management.

The
    introduction of new accounting rules, laws or regulations could
    adversely impact our  results of operations.

Complying with new accounting rules, laws or regulations could
    adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations
    or funding requirements, or cause unanticipated fluctuations in
    our results of operations in future periods.



We may be
    subject to workforce influences, including work stoppages, which
    could increase  our operating costs and disrupt our
    operations.

As of December 31, 2008, approximately 27% of our workforce
    was represented by various local labor unions. If, in the
    future, our unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work
    stoppage or other slowdown, we could experience a significant
    disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating
    costs, which could have an adverse impact on our results of
    operations and cash flows. In addition, if a greater percentage
    of our workforce becomes unionized, our business and financial
    results could be materially and adversely impacted due to the
    potential for increased operating costs.

Our obligation
    to fund multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute may
    have an  adverse impact on us.

We contribute to at least 25 multi-employer pension plans
    covering at least 22% of our current employees. We do not
    administer these plans and generally are not represented on the
    boards of trustees of these plans. The Pension Protection Act
    enacted in 2006 requires under-funded pension plans to improve
    their funding ratios. We do not have current plan financial
    information for the multi-employer plans to which we contribute
    but, based on the information available to us, we believe that
    some of them are under-funded. We cannot determine at this time
    the amount of additional funding, if any, we may be required to
    make to these plans and, therefore, have not recorded any
    related liabilities. However, plan assessments could have an
    adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a
    given period. Furthermore, under current law, upon the
    termination of a multi-employer pension plan, or in the event of
    a mass withdrawal of contributing employers, we would be
    required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate
    share of the plan’s unfunded vested liabilities. There can
    be no assurance that there will not be a termination of, or mass
    withdrawal of employers contributing to, any of the
    multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute or that, in
    the event of such a termination or mass withdrawal, the amounts
    we would be required to contribute would not have a material
    adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows.

The costs of
    providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements
    are subject to  changes in pension fund values and fluctuating
    actuarial assumptions, and may have a  material adverse impact
    on our results of operations and cash flows.

We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan which is funded with
    trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and
    equity securities. Our costs for providing such benefits and
    related funding requirements are subject to changes in the
    market value of plan assets. The recent significant decline in
    the markets resulted in our recording a value for the plan
    assets that significantly differed from the plan asset value
    Allied had recorded in its financial statements prior to the
    merger. A continuation or further decline in the value of these
    investments could increase our pension expenses and related
    funding requirements in the future. Additionally, our pension
    expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to
    various actuarial calculations and assumptions, which may differ
    materially from actual results due to changing market and
    economic conditions, interest rates and other factors. A
    significant increase in our pension obligations and funding
    requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results
    of operations and cash flows.

The loss of
    key personnel could have material adverse effect on our
    financial condition,  results of operations and growth
    prospects.

Our future success depends on the continued contributions of
    several key employees and officers. The loss of the services of
    key employees and officers, whether such loss is through
    resignation or other causes, or the inability to attract
    additional qualified personnel, could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
    growth prospects.

PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters is located at 18500 North Allied Way,
    Phoenix, Arizona 85054 where we currently lease approximately
    145,000 square feet of office space. We also maintain
    regional administrative offices in all of our regions.

Our principal property and equipment consists of land,
    landfills, buildings, vehicles and equipment. We own or lease
    real property in the states in which we conduct operations. At
    December 31, 2008, we owned or operated 400 collection
    companies, 242 transfer stations, 213 active solid waste
    landfills and 78 recycling facilities within 40 states and
    Puerto Rico. In aggregate, our active solid waste landfills
    total approximately 110,200 acres, including approximately
    36,900 permitted acres. We also own or have responsibilities for
    126 closed landfills. We believe that our property and equipment
    are adequate for our current needs.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in routine judicial and administrative
    proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business and
    that relate to, among other things, personal injury or property
    damage claims, employment matters and commercial and contractual
    disputes. We are subject to federal, state and local
    environmental laws and regulations. Due to the nature of our
    business, we are also often routinely a party to judicial or
    administrative proceedings involving governmental authorities
    and other interested parties related to environmental
    regulations or liabilities. From time to time, we may also be
    subject to actions brought by citizens’ groups, adjacent
    landowners or others in connection with the permitting and
    licensing of our landfills or transfer stations, or alleging
    personal injury, environmental damage, or violations of the
    permits and licenses pursuant to which we operate.

We are subject to various federal, state and local tax rules and
    regulations. These rules are extensive and often complex, and we
    are required to interpret and apply them to our transactions.
    Positions taken in tax filings are subject to challenge by
    taxing authorities. Accordingly, we may have exposure for
    additional tax liabilities if, upon audit, any positions taken
    are disallowed by the taxing authorities.

The following is a discussion of certain proceedings against us.
    Although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be
    predicted with certainty, except as identified below, we do not
    believe that the outcome of our pending legal and administrative
    proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated, financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Litigation
    Related to the Merger with Allied

On July 25, 2008, a putative class action was filed, and on
    August 15, 2008 was amended, in the Court of Chancery of
    the State of Delaware by the New Jersey Carpenters Pension and
    the New Jersey Carpenters Annuity Funds against us and the
    members of our Board of Directors, individually.

On August 21, 2008, a second putative class action was
    filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by David
    Shade against us, the members of Republic’s Board of
    Directors, individually, and Allied. On September 22, 2008,
    the New Jersey Carpenters and the Shade cases were consolidated
    by the Court of Chancery, and on September 24, 2008, the
    plaintiffs in the Delaware case, now known as In Re: Republic
    Services Inc. Shareholders Litigation, filed a verified
    consolidated amended class action complaint in the Court of
    Chancery of the State of Delaware.

On September 5, 2008, a putative class action was filed in
    the Circuit Court in and for Broward County, Florida, by the
    Teamsters Local 456 Annuity Fund against us and the members of
    Republic’s Board of Directors, individually.

Both the Delaware consolidated action and the Florida action
    were brought on behalf of a purported class of our stockholders
    and primarily sought, among other things, to enjoin the proposed
    transaction between Republic and Allied, as well as damages and
    attorneys’ fees. The actions also sought to compel us to



accept the unsolicited proposals made by Waste, or at least
    compel our Board of Directors to further consider and evaluate
    the Waste proposals, which proposals were subsequently withdrawn.

On September 24, 2008, the defendants in the Florida
    litigation filed a Motion to Stay or to Dismiss the lawsuit in
    light of the consolidated Delaware class action.

On October 17, 2008, plaintiffs in the consolidated
    Delaware action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction
    seeking to require the defendants to make certain additional
    disclosures prior to the stockholder vote on the merger.

On October 29, 2008, the defendants entered into a
    memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs regarding the
    settlement of the Delaware and Florida actions. As part of this
    memorandum of understanding, we agreed to make certain
    additional disclosures to our stockholders and such disclosures
    were made by us in our Current Report on

Form 8-K

filed with the SEC on October 30, 2008. As of
    January 16, 2009, following completion of certain
    confirmatory discovery by counsel to plaintiffs, the parties
    executed a stipulation of settlement. The stipulation of
    settlement is subject to customary conditions, including court
    approval following notice to our stockholders. The stipulation
    of settlement provides that a hearing will be scheduled at which
    the court will consider the fairness, reasonableness and
    adequacy of the settlement which, if finally approved by the
    court, will resolve all of the claims that were or could have
    been brought in the actions being settled, including all claims
    relating to the merger transaction, the merger agreement, our
    rejections of the unsolicited Waste proposals, and any
    disclosures made in connection therewith. The stipulation of
    settlement also provides that plaintiffs’ counsel may
    petition the court for an award of attorneys’ fees and
    expenses to be paid by us. On February 20, 2009, the court
    preliminarily approved the settlement agreed to in the
    stipulation and set a final hearing to consider the fairness of
    the settlement for May 19, 2009. There can be no assurance
    that the court will approve the settlement agreed to in the
    stipulation of settlement. In such event, the settlement may be
    terminated.

On December 3, 2008, the DOJ and seven state attorneys
    general filed a complaint, Hold Separate Stipulation and Order,
    and competitive impact statement, together with a proposed final
    judgment, in the United States District Court for the District
    of Columbia, in connection with approval under the HSR Act of
    our merger with Allied. The court entered the Hold Separate
    Stipulation and Order on December 4, 2008, which terminated
    the waiting period under the HSR Act and allowed the parties to
    close the transaction subject to the conditions described in the
    Hold Separate Stipulation and Order. These conditions include
    the divestiture of certain assets. However, the final judgment
    can only be approved by the court after the DOJ publishes a
    notice in the Federal Register and considers comments it
    receives. During this period, if the DOJ believes that the final
    judgment is no longer in the public interest, the DOJ may
    withdraw its support of the final judgment and seek to prevent
    the final judgment from becoming final in its present form.
    Likewise, the court may, in its discretion, modify the
    divestitures or other relief sought by the DOJ if the court
    believes that such modification is in the public interest. The
    precise timing for the confirmation of the final judgment is not
    known. Management believes that the court will enter the final
    judgment and that modifications to the final judgment, if any,
    will not be material.

Landfill and
    Environmental

We have been notified that we are considered a potentially
    responsible party at a number of sites under CERCLA or other
    environmental laws. In all cases, such alleged responsibility is
    due to the actions of companies prior to the time we acquired
    them. We continually review our status with respect to each
    site, taking into account the alleged connection to the site and
    the extent of the contribution to the volume of waste at the
    site, the available evidence connecting the entity to that site,
    and the number and financial soundness of other potentially
    responsible parties at the site. The ultimate amounts for
    environmental liabilities at sites where we may be a potentially
    responsible party cannot be determined and estimates of such
    liabilities made by us require assumptions about future events
    subject to a number of uncertainties, including the extent of
    the contamination, the appropriate remedy, the financial
    viability of other potentially responsible parties and the final
    apportionment of responsibility among the potentially
    responsible parties.



Where we have concluded that our share of potential liabilities
    is probable and can be reasonably estimated, a provision has
    been made in the consolidated financial statements. Since the
    ultimate outcome of these matters may differ from the estimates
    used in our assessments to date, the recorded liabilities are
    periodically evaluated as additional information becomes
    available to ascertain that the accrued liabilities are
    adequate. We have liabilities recorded for environmental matters
    as of December 31, 2008 of approximately
    $389.9 million. It is reasonably possible that we could
    have adjustments to our estimates for these matters in the near
    term that could have a material effect on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For
    more information about our potential environmental liabilities

    consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Countywide
    Matter

On March 26, 2007, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
    (OEPA) issued Final Findings and Orders (F&Os) to Republic
    Services of Ohio II, LLC (Republic-Ohio), an Ohio limited
    liability company and our wholly owned subsidiary. The F&Os
    relate to environmental conditions attributed to a chemical
    reaction resulting from the disposal of certain aluminum
    production waste at the Countywide Recycling and Disposal
    facility (Countywide) in East Sparta, Ohio. The F&Os, and
    certain other remedial actions Republic-Ohio agreed with the
    OEPA to undertake to address the environmental conditions,
    include, without limitation, the following actions:
    (a) prohibiting leachate recirculation, (b) refraining
    from the disposal of solid waste in certain portions of the
    site, (c) updating engineering plans and specifications and
    providing further information regarding the integrity of various
    engineered components at the site, (d) performing
    additional data collection, (e) taking additional measures
    to address emissions, (f) expanding the gas collection and
    control system, (g) installing a “fire” break,
    (h) removing liquids from gas extraction wells, and
    (i) submitting a plan to the OEPA to suppress the chemical
    reaction and, following approval by the OEPA, implementing such
    plan. We also paid approximately $.7 million in sanctions
    to comply with the F&Os during the three months ended
    March 31, 2007. Republic-Ohio has performed certain interim
    remedial actions required by the OEPA, but the OEPA has not
    approved Republic-Ohio’s plan to suppress the chemical
    reaction.

Republic-Ohio received additional orders from the OEPA requiring
    certain actions to be taken by Republic-Ohio, including
    additional air quality monitoring and the installation and
    continued maintenance of gas well dewatering systems.
    Republic-Ohio has also entered into an Agreed Order on Consent
    (AOC) with the EPA requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred
    by the EPA and requiring Republic-Ohio to (a) design and
    install a temperature and gas monitoring system, (b) design
    and install a composite cap or cover, and (c) develop and
    implement an air monitoring program. The AOC became effective on
    April 17, 2008 and Republic-Ohio has complied with the
    terms of the AOC. Republic-Ohio also is in the process of
    constructing an additional “fire” break under the
    authority and supervision of the EPA.

We had learned that the Commissioner of the Stark County Health
    Department (Commission) recommended that the Stark County Board
    of Health (Board of Health) suspend Countywide’s 2007
    annual operating license. We had also learned that the
    Commissioner intended to recommend that the Board of Health deny
    Countywide’s license application for 2008. Republic-Ohio
    obtained a preliminary injunction on November 28, 2007
    prohibiting the Board of Health from suspending its 2007
    operating license. Republic-Ohio also obtained a preliminary
    injunction on February 15, 2008 prohibiting the Board of
    Health from denying its 2008 operating license application. The
    litigation with the Board of Health is pending in the Stark
    County Court of Common Pleas. We and the Board of Health have
    been participating in discussions regarding facility licensing
    that have resulted in an agreement whereby Republic-Ohio will
    secure its operating license and pay $10.0 million to
    resolve the issues at Countywide. The specific terms of the
    agreement are being finalized.

We believe that we have performed or are diligently performing
    all actions required under the F&Os and the AOC and that
    Countywide does not pose a threat to the environment.
    Additionally, we believe that we satisfy the rules and
    regulations that govern the operating license at Countywide.



We are vigorously pursuing financial contributions from third
    parties for our costs to comply with the F&Os and the other
    required remedial actions.

In a suit filed on October 8, 2008 in the Tuscarawas County
    Ohio Court of Common Pleas, approximately 700 plaintiffs have
    named Republic Services, Inc. and Republic-Ohio as defendants.
    The claims alleged are negligence and nuisance and arise from
    the operation of Countywide. Republic-Ohio has owned and
    operated Countywide since February 1, 1999. Waste
    Management, Inc. and Waste Management Ohio, Inc., previous
    owners and operators of Countywide, have been named as
    defendants as well. Plaintiffs are individuals and businesses
    located in the geographic area around Countywide. They claim
    that due to the acceptance of a specific waste stream and
    operational issues and conditions, the landfill has generated
    odors and other unsafe emissions which have allegedly impaired
    the use and value of their property. There are also allegations
    that the emissions from the landfill may have adverse health
    effects. The relief requested includes compensatory damages,
    punitive damages, costs for medical monitoring and screening,
    interest on damages, costs and disbursements, and reasonable
    attorney and expert witness fees. We intend to vigorously defend
    against the plaintiffs’ allegations.

Sunrise
    Matter

On August 1, 2008, Republic Services of Southern Nevada
    (RSSN), our wholly owned subsidiary, signed a Consent Decree
    with the EPA, the Bureau of Land Management and Clark County,
    Nevada related to the Sunrise Landfill. Under the Consent
    Decree, RSSN has agreed to perform certain remedial actions at
    the Sunrise Landfill for which RSSN and Clark County were
    otherwise jointly and severally liable. We were also assessed
    $1.0 million in sanctions related to the Consent Decree.
    RSSN is currently working with the Clark County Staff and Board
    of Commissioners to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to
    comply with the Consent Decree. However, we have not recorded
    any potential recoveries.

It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the
    remediation liabilities recorded to reflect the effects of new
    or additional information, to the extent that such information
    impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions.
    Future changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration
    of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Luri
    Matter

On August 17, 2007, a lawsuit was filed against us and
    certain of our subsidiaries relating to an alleged retaliation
    claim by a former employee, Ronald Luri v. Republic
    Services, Inc., Republic Services of Ohio Hauling LLC, Republic
    Services of Ohio I LLC, Jim Bowen and Ron Krall in the Cuyahoga
    County Common Pleas Court in Ohio. On July 3, 2008, a jury
    verdict was awarded against us in the amount of
    $46.6 million, including $43.1 million in punitive
    damages. On September 24, 2008, the Court awarded
    pre-judgement interest of $.3 million and attorney fees and
    litigation costs of $1.1 million. Post-judgement interest
    is presently accruing at a rate of 8% for 2008 and 5% for 2009.
    Management anticipates that post-judgement interest could accrue
    through the middle of 2010 for a total of $5.4 million.
    Post-judgment motions filed on our behalf and certain of our
    subsidiaries were denied, and on October 1, 2008, we filed
    a notice of appeal. It is reasonably possible that a final,
    non-appealable judgment of liability for compensatory and
    punitive damages may be assessed against us related to this
    matter. Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate
    outcome, management believes that the amount of any final,
    non-appealable judgment will not be material.

Forward
    Matter

On November 23, 2005, Allied received a letter from the
    San Joaquin District Attorney’s Office, Environmental
    Prosecutions Unit (the District Attorney), alleging violations
    of California permit and regulatory requirements relating to
    Forward, Inc. (Forward), its wholly owned subsidiary, and the
    operation of its landfill. The District Attorney is
    investigating whether Forward may have (i) mixed green
    waste with food waste as “alternative daily cover,”
    (ii) exceeded the daily and weekly tonnage



intake limits, (iii) allowed a concentration of methane gas
    well in excess of 5 percent, or (iv) accepted
    hazardous waste at a landfill which is not authorized to accept
    hazardous waste. Such conduct allegedly violates provisions of
    Business and Professions Code sections 17200, et seq, by
    virtue of violations of Public Resources Code Division 30,
    Part 4, Chapter 3, Article 1, sections 44004
    and 44014(b); California Code of Regulations Title 27,
    Chapter 3, Subchapter 4, Article 6,
    sections 20690(11) and 20919.5; and Health and Safety Code
    sections 25200, 25100, et seq, and 25500, et seq. On
    December 7, 2006, Forward received a subpoena and
    interrogatories from the District Attorney and responded to both
    as of February 15, 2007. On October 1, 2008, the
    District Attorney served suit against Allied alleging violations
    of the California Business and Professional Code
    sections 17200, et seq. and is seeking monetary sanctions
    of up to $2,500 per violation and a permanent injunction to obey
    all applicable laws and regulations. We intend to vigorously
    defend the allegations.

Sycamore
    Matter

On July 10, 2008, the State of West Virginia Department of
    Environmental Protection filed suit against Allied’s
    subsidiary, Allied Waste Sycamore Landfill, LLC (Sycamore
    Landfill), in Putnam County Circuit Court alleging thirty-eight
    violations of the Solid Waste Management Act, W. Va. Code sec.

22-15-1

et
    seq, the Water Pollution Control Act, W. Va. Code Sec.

22-11-1

et
    seq and the Groundwater Protection Act, W. Va. Code sec.

22-12-1

et
    seq (collectively, the Applicable Statues) between January 2007
    and August 2007. The State of West Virginia is seeking
    injunctive relief requiring the Sycamore Landfill to comply with
    the Applicable Statutes as well to eliminate all common law
    public nuisances, and is seeking monetary sanctions of up to
    $25,000 per day for each violation. We are currently negotiating
    a settlement with the State which we believe will include
    monetary sanctions below $200,000.

20 Atlantic
    Avenue Matter

On October 3, 2008, a jury in federal district court in
    Boston, Massachusetts, returned a verdict in favor of the
    plaintiff and against the defendant, Allied, in a breach of
    contract action. The jury concluded that, between 1997 and 2002,
    Allied had failed to deliver as much fiber recyclables as
    required under a contract and the jury stated that damages were
    approximately $10.4 million. Under applicable law,
    prejudgment interest of 12% per year (approximately
    $10.5 million through December 31, 2008) is
    automatically added to the verdict amount when judgment is
    entered by the court. The jury verdict did not address all the
    claims pending in the lawsuit. A hearing before the judge on
    some of the remaining claims was scheduled to begin
    January 6, 2009. On January 5, 2009, the parties
    reached a settlement in which all claims in the lawsuit will be
    dismissed in exchange for a payment of $18.0 million from
    us to the plaintiff, which we have recorded as a liability. The
    payment will be made in three installments during the first
    three quarters of 2009 and the second and third installments
    will bear interest at 3% per annum.

Carter Valley
    Matter

On April 12, 2006, federal agents executed a search warrant
    at BFI Waste Systems of Tennessee, LLC’s Carter Valley
    Landfill (the Landfill) and seized information regarding the
    Landfill’s receipt of special waste from one of its
    commercial customers. On the same date, the
    U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of
    Tennessee served a grand jury subpoena on us seeking related
    documents (the 2006 Subpoena). Shortly thereafter, the
    government agreed to an indefinite extension of our time to
    respond to the subpoena, and there were no further
    communications between us and the federal government until 2008.
    In 2007, while the federal investigation was pending, the
    Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
    investigated the Landfill’s receipt of the same special
    waste, determined that there was not a sufficient basis to
    conclude that the Landfill had disposed of hazardous waste, and
    took no enforcement action. On April 2, 2008, the US
    Attorney’s Office issued a new grand jury subpoena seeking
    the same categories of documents requested in the 2006 Subpoena.
    We are currently producing documents in response to the 2008
    subpoena. On January 21, 2009, the DOJ sent a letter to us
    stating that it believed, based on its initial investigation,
    that certain unnamed employees at the Landfill had violated the
    RCRA and that we were liable for these criminal violations under
    the theory of

respondeat superior

. If convicted, pursuant
    to applicable law, we could be subject to a wide range of
    criminal or civil



penalties. Criminal penalties may not be more than the greatest
    of a maximum of $50,000 for each day of violation, a calculation
    of twice the gross pecuniary gain from the offense or a maximum
    of $500,000. We could also be subject to civil penalties of
    $32,500 per day per violation. We intend to meet with the DOJ as
    soon as practicable to discuss the government’s
    investigation and understand the basis for the government’s
    belief that our employees violated RCRA.

Tax
    Matters

We and our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the U.S.
    and Puerto Rico as well as income tax in multiple state
    jurisdictions. We acquired Allied’s open tax periods as
    part of the acquisition. Allied is currently under examination
    or administrative review by various state and federal taxing
    authorities for certain tax years, including federal income tax
    audits for calendar years 2000 through 2006. We are also engaged
    in tax litigation as a result of our risk management companies.
    These matters are further discussed below.

Risk
    Management Companies

Prior to Allied’s acquisition of BFI on July 30, 1999,
    BFI operating companies, as part of a risk management initiative
    to manage and reduce costs associated with certain liabilities,
    contributed assets and existing environmental and self-insurance
    liabilities to six fully consolidated BFI risk management
    companies (RMCs) in exchange for stock representing a minority
    ownership interest in the RMCs. Subsequently, the BFI operating
    companies sold that stock in the RMCs to third parties at fair
    market value which resulted in a capital loss of approximately
    $900.0 million for tax purposes, calculated as the excess
    of the tax basis of the stock over the cash proceeds received.

On January 18, 2001, the IRS designated this type of
    transaction and other similar transactions as a
    “potentially abusive tax shelter” under IRS
    regulations. During 2002, the IRS proposed the disallowance of
    all of this capital loss. At the time of the disallowance, the
    primary argument advanced by the IRS for disallowing the capital
    loss was that the tax basis of the stock of the RMCs received by
    the BFI operating companies was required to be reduced by the
    amount of liabilities assumed by the RMCs even though such
    liabilities were contingent and, therefore, not liabilities
    recognized for tax purposes. Under the IRS interpretation, there
    was no capital loss on the sale of the stock since the tax basis
    of the stock should have approximated the proceeds received.
    Allied protested the disallowance to the Appeals Office of the
    IRS in August 2002.

In April 2005, the Appeals Office of the IRS upheld the
    disallowance of the capital loss deduction. As a result, in late
    April 2005 Allied paid a deficiency to the IRS of
    $22.6 million for BFI tax years prior to the acquisition.
    Allied also received a notification from the IRS assessing a
    penalty of $5.4 million and interest of $12.8 million
    relating to the asserted $22.6 million deficiency. In July
    2005, Allied filed a suit for refund in the United States Court
    of Federal Claims (CFC). The government thereafter filed a
    counterclaim in the case for the $5.4 million penalty and
    $12.8 million of interest claimed by the IRS. In December
    2005, the IRS agreed to suspend the collection of this penalty
    and interest until a decision is rendered on Allied’s suit
    for refund.

In July 2006, while the CFC case was pending, Allied discovered
    what it construed to be a jurisdictional defect in the case that
    could have prevented its recovery of the refund amounts claimed
    even if Allied would have been successful on the underlying
    merits. Accordingly, in September 2006, Allied filed a
    motion to dismiss the case without prejudice on jurisdictional
    grounds. In March 2007, the CFC granted Allied’s motion
    dismissing the case. Thereafter, in July 2007, the government
    appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for
    the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit). In April 2008, the
    Federal Circuit reversed the lower court’s decision and
    remanded the case back to the CFC for further proceedings. In
    May 2008, Allied filed a petition for panel rehearing with the
    Federal Circuit, requesting that the court reconsider its
    ruling. In June 2008, the Federal Circuit denied Allied’s
    petition.

In December 2008, a hearing was held in the CFC. At this
    hearing, we informed the judge of our intention to withdraw our
    suit from the CFC in order to continue to litigate the merits of
    our position in the U.S. District



Court of Arizona. We believe the decisional law applicable to
    this matter is more favorable to taxpayers in the
    U.S. District Court of Arizona than in the CFC.

To expedite the withdrawal from the CFC, in January 2009, we
    paid the government’s counterclaim for penalty and
    penalty-related interest of approximately $11.0 million.
    Prior to December 31, 2008, Allied had already paid
    $51.0 million in tax and related interest relating to the
    1997 through 1999 BFI tax years. As a result, we have paid all
    tax, interest, and penalty related to the 1997 through 1999 BFI
    tax years, which are the tax years under CFC jurisdiction. If,
    in response to our decision to withdraw our suit from the CFC,
    the court issues an order dismissing the case with prejudice,
    the tax, interest and penalty amounts paid by us will not be
    recoverable in any subsequent action. However, if the court
    issues an order dismissing the case without prejudice, we will
    not be entirely prevented from asserting a claim contesting the
    IRS tax adjustment applicable to the 1997 through 1999 BFI tax
    years and seeking the recovery of some or all of the tax,
    interest and penalty amounts previously paid, although some of
    our claim may be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.

In addition, Allied has a second refund suit currently pending
    in Arizona. In August 2008, Allied received from the IRS a
    Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) related to its
    utilization of BFI’s capital loss carryforward on
    Allied’s 1999 tax return. Because of the high rate of
    interest associated with this matter, Allied previously paid all
    tax and interest related to this tax year. Consequently, the
    Notice related only to the IRS’ asserted penalty for
    Allied’s 1999 tax year. On October 30, 2008, Allied
    filed a suit for refund in the U.S. District Court of
    Arizona. We anticipate that the DOJ will file a counterclaim for
    the asserted penalty and consequently the IRS will suspend
    collection of the penalty, as occurred in connection with the
    CFC action. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS will
    suspend collection efforts.

If the capital loss deduction is fully disallowed for all
    applicable years, we estimate that it would have a total cash
    impact (including amounts already paid to the IRS as described
    below) of approximately $457.0 million related to federal
    taxes, state taxes and interest, and, approximately
    $164.0 million related to penalty and penalty-related
    interest. These amounts have been fully accrued on our
    consolidated balance sheet, and disallowance would not
    materially affect our consolidated results of operations;
    however, a payment beyond the amounts already paid would
    adversely impact our cash flows in the period such payment was
    made. The accrual of additional interest charges through the
    time these matters are resolved will affect our consolidated
    results of operations. Due to the high rate of interest
    associated with this matter, we have previously paid the IRS and
    various state tax authorities $369.0 million related to
    capital loss deductions taken on BFI’s 1997 through 1999
    and Allied’s 1999 through 2002 tax returns. In addition, we
    have paid approximately $11.0 million of penalty and
    penalty-related interest for our refund suit in the CFC.
    Although we have fully accrued all tax, interest, penalty and
    penalty-related interest relating to this matter, we intend to
    vigorously pursue our claim for refund of the tax and interest
    and our defense to the IRS’ claims for penalties and
    penalty-related interest. While there can be no assurances, we
    anticipate that the final resolution of the dispute, through
    adjudication or settlement, may be more favorable than the full
    amount currently accrued for tax, interest, penalty and
    penalty-related interest.

Exchange of
    Partnership Interests

In April 2002, Allied exchanged minority partnership interests
    in four

waste-to-energy

facilities for majority partnership interests in equipment
    purchasing businesses, which are now wholly owned subsidiaries.
    In November 2008, the IRS issued a formal disallowance to Allied
    contending that the exchange was instead a sale on which a
    corresponding gain should have been recognized. Although we
    intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter, if the
    exchange is treated as a sale, we estimate it could have a
    potential federal and state cash tax impact of approximately
    $156.0 million plus accrued interest through
    December 31, 2008 of approximately $48.0 million. In
    addition, the IRS has asserted a penalty of 20% of the
    additional income tax due. The potential tax and interest (but
    not penalties or penalty-related interest) of a full adjustment
    for this matter have been fully reserved on our consolidated
    balance sheet at December 31, 2008. The successful
    assertion by the IRS of penalty and penalty-related interest in



connection with this matter could have a material adverse impact
    on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations.

There were approximately 930 record holders of our common
    stock at February 19, 2009, which does not include
    beneficial owners for whom Cede & Co. or others act as
    nominees.

In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a regular
    quarterly dividend of $.19 per share for stockholders of record
    on April 1, 2009. We expect to continue to pay quarterly
    cash dividends, and we may consider increasing our quarterly
    cash dividends if we believe it will enhance shareholder value.

We have the ability under our credit facilities to pay dividends
    and repurchase our common stock subject to our compliance with
    the financial covenants in our credit facilities. As of
    December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the financial
    covenants of our credit facilities.

Issuer Purchases
    of Equity Securities

From 2000 through 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $2.6 billion of our common stock. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had paid $2.3 billion to
    repurchase 82.6 million shares of our common stock, of
    which 4.6 million shares were acquired during 2008 for
    $138.4 million. We suspended our share repurchase program
    in the second quarter of 2008 due to the pending merger with
    Allied. We expect that our share repurchase program will
    continue to be suspended until our credit statistics return to
    pre-merger levels.

Performance
    Graph

The following performance graph compares the performance of our
    common stock to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock
    Index (S&P 500 Index), the Dow Jones Waste &
    Disposal Services Index (DJW&DS Index) and to an index of
    peer companies as described below.

The merger with Allied in December 2008 resulted in the
    following changes to our performance comparison:

§

We are part of the S&P 500 Index, post merger, therefore,
    as required by applicable SEC rules, we replaced the NYSE
    Composite Index comparison with the S&P 500 Index, and

§

We are using the DJW&DS Index to replace the peer group
    index we used last year. The prior peer group index consisted of
    Waste and Allied only. Since December 5, 2008, Allied has
    been our subsidiary as a result of the merger. We believe that
    comparing ourselves to a single competitor (Waste) going forward
    would not be meaningful. We believe that the numerous and
    diversified companies represented by the DJW&DS index
    provides a more relevant comparison. For purposes of preserving
    the prior year index we included Allied through the end of
    November 2008, which approximates the merger date.

The graph covers the period from December 31, 2003 to

SELECTED
    FINANCIAL DATA

The following Selected Financial Data should be read in
    conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes
    thereto as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 and for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 and
    Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations

included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our merger with Allied was effective December 5, 2008 and
    has been accounted for as an acquisition of Allied by Republic.
    The consolidated financial statements include the operating
    results of Allied from the date of the acquisition, and have not
    been retroactively restated to include Allied’s historical
    financial position or results of operations. In accordance with
    the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid has
    been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon
    their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the
    excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being
    recorded as goodwill.

Our shares, per share data and weighted average common and
    common equivalent shares outstanding have been retroactively
    adjusted for all periods prior to 2007 to reflect a

3-for-2

stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was effective
    on March 16, 2007.

See Notes 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the notes to our
    consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this
    Form 10-K for a discussion of basis of presentation,
    significant accounting policies, business acquisitions and
    divestitures, assets held for sale, restructuring charges,
    landfill and environmental costs, debt, income taxes and
    stockholders’ equity and their effect on comparability of

year-to-year

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
    our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes
    thereto, included elsewhere herein. This discussion may contain
    forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on
    management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We
    discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual
    results to differ from expectations in Item 1A. Risk
    Factors.

Overview of Our
    Business

As of December 31, 2008, we are the second largest provider
    of services in the domestic non-hazardous solid waste industry.
    We provide non-hazardous solid waste collection services for
    commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers
    through 400 collection companies in 40 states and Puerto
    Rico. We also own or operate 242 transfer stations, 213 active
    solid waste landfills and 78 recycling facilities.

In early 2008, we began to experience the impact of the economic
    slowdown on our operations. This slowdown intensified during
    2008 which, combined with a tightening of the credit markets,
    resulted in unprecedented changes in the U.S. and global
    economies. Against this backdrop, consumption in the U.S. slowed
    dramatically. New housing construction, a primary driver of our
    temporary industrial collection business, declined in excess of
    40% compared to 2007. More recently we are seeing a slowdown in
    commercial construction. A slowdown in manufacturing has
    resulted in a decrease in our permanent industrial collection
    business. Furthermore, volumes in our commercial collection
    business began to decline in the second half of 2008 as
    consumers decreased discretionary spending. We are also
    beginning to see lower commercial volumes due to store closures
    and increased commercial vacancies. Fuel prices, which reached
    historic highs in the summer, dropped quickly in the fall of
    2008. This decrease in fuel prices was offset by corresponding
    declines in fuel surcharges and, therefore, did not
    significantly improve our profitability. In addition, prices for
    recycling commodities declined in response to a decline in
    global demand. Although we hedged a portion of our commodity
    sales, declines in commodity prices have had, and will continue
    to have, a significant impact on our profitability.

Despite the challenging economic environment, our business
    performed well during 2008 due in large part to the
    indispensible nature of our services and the scalability of our
    business. Our internal revenue growth during 2008 was 2.5%.
    Increases in core price and fuel recovery fees offset volume
    declines. This increase in price and fuel recovery fees,
    together with cost control steps taken by our operations
    management to scale the business down for lower volumes, also
    served to moderate profit margin declines associated with rising
    costs and declining revenue due to decreases in service volumes.

During December 2008, we completed our merger with Allied,
    forming the second largest waste management company in the U.S.
    We believe that this merger creates a strong operating platform
    that will allow us to continue to provide quality service to our
    customers and superior returns to our stockholders.

We expect that the economic challenges we experienced during the
    latter part of 2008 will continue throughout 2009. We anticipate
    a decrease in volumes in all lines of our business. We also
    anticipate that prices for recycling commodities will remain
    depressed. However, we believe that we will benefit from our
    cost control and pricing initiatives. Ours is a capital
    intensive business. Slower growth allows us to reduce capital
    spending, thus maintaining strong free cash flow despite a
    weaker economy. In addition, we intend to focus our attention on
    integrating our newly merged company and achieving cost
    synergies as a result of the merger.

Business
    Acquisitions and Divestitures

We make decisions to acquire, invest in or divest of businesses
    based on financial and strategic considerations. Businesses
    acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of
    accounting and are included in our consolidated financial
    statements from the date of acquisition.



Merger with
    Allied Waste Industries, Inc.

On June 22, 2008, Republic entered into an Agreement and
    Plan of Merger with Allied. Prior to the merger, Allied was the
    second largest provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection,
    transfer, recycling and disposal services in the United States,
    as measured by revenue. The completion of the merger was subject
    to certain terms and conditions, including, but not limited to,
    approval of the transaction by the stockholders of both Republic
    and Allied, regulatory approval from the DOJ, and receipt of
    credit ratings for the combined company classifying our senior
    unsecured debt as investment grade. Having met those terms and
    conditions on December 5, 2008, we completed the merger.

As of the effective date of the merger, each share of Allied
    common stock outstanding was converted into .45 shares of
    our common stock. We issued approximately 195.8 million
    shares of common stock to Allied stockholders in the merger.
    Allied stockholders received approximately 52% of the
    outstanding common stock of the combined company in respect of
    their Allied shares on a diluted basis as a result of the
    merger, and Republic stockholders retained approximately 48% of
    the outstanding common stock of the combined company on a
    diluted basis. The total purchase price paid for Allied,
    including the value of common stock issued (based on the average
    closing prices of Republic’s common stock for the

five-day

period around June 23, 2008 (the announcement date))
    totaled approximately $11.5 billion.

Republic has been determined to be the acquiring company for
    accounting purposes in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141,

Business
    Combinations

(SFAS 141). Therefore, we have accounted
    for the merger as an acquisition of Allied by Republic, using
    the purchase method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. Our
    consolidated financial statements include the operating results
    of Allied from the date of the acquisition, and have not been
    retroactively restated to include Allied’s historical
    financial position or results of operations. In accordance with
    the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid has
    been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon
    their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the
    excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being
    recorded as goodwill. Republic is in the process of valuing all
    of the assets and liabilities acquired in the acquisition, and,
    until we have completed our valuation process, there may be
    adjustments to our estimates of fair values and the resulting
    preliminary purchase price allocation.

Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill)
    associated with the acquisition of Allied totaled
    $9.0 billion. In addition, when we acquire landfills as
    part of a group of assets, we allocate part of the purchase
    price to airspace based on the estimated fair value of the
    landfills relative to the fair value of other assets within the
    acquired group. We allocated $2.6 billion of the total
    purchase price paid for the acquisition of Allied to landfill
    airspace. Landfill purchase price is amortized using the

units-of-consumption

method over total available airspace, which includes probable
    expansion airspace where appropriate.

As a condition of the merger with Allied, we reached a
    settlement with the DOJ requiring us to divest of assets serving
    fifteen metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles and San
    Francisco, CA; Denver, CO; Atlanta, GA; Northwestern Indiana;
    Lexington, KY; Flint, MI; Cape Girardeau, MO; Charlotte, NC;
    Cleveland, OH; Philadelphia, PA; Greenville-Spartanburg, SC; and
    Fort Worth, Houston and Lubbock, TX. The settlement requires us
    to divest of 87 commercial waste collection routes, nine
    municipal solid waste landfills and ten transfer stations,
    together with ancillary assets and, in three cases, access to
    landfill disposal capacity. In February 2009, we entered into an
    agreement to divest certain assets to Waste Connections, Inc.
    The assets that are being divested under this agreement include
    six municipal solid waste landfills, six collection operations
    and three transfer stations across the following seven markets:
    Los Angeles, CA; Denver, CO; Houston, TX; Lubbock, TX;
    Greenville-Spartanburg, SC; Charlotte, NC; and Flint, MI. The
    transaction with Waste Connections is subject to closing
    conditions regarding due diligence, regulatory approval and
    other customary matters. Closing is expected to occur in the
    second quarter of 2009. Combined revenue of the assets being
    sold is approximately $110.0 million.

During December 2008, we incurred $82.7 million of
    restructuring charges associated with integrating our operations
    with Allied. These charges primarily consist of severance and
    other employee termination and relocation benefits and
    consulting fees paid to outside parties.



Other Business
    Acquisitions and Divestitures

In addition to the acquisition of Allied in December 2008, we
    acquired various other solid waste businesses during the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The aggregate
    purchase price we paid for these transactions was
    $13.4 million, $4.4 million and $4.9 million,
    respectively.

Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill)
    associated with these acquisitions during 2008, 2007 and 2006
    totaled $2.2 million, $1.0 million and
    $1.0 million, respectively.

In November 2007, we divested of our Texas-based compost, mulch
    and soil business and received proceeds of $36.5 million. A
    gain of $12.5 million was recorded in 2007 on this
    divestiture.

Revenue

We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection
    operations. Our remaining revenue is from other services
    including landfill disposal and recycling.

Our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we
    receive from commercial, industrial, municipal and residential
    customers. Our residential and commercial collection operations
    in some markets are based on long-term contracts with
    municipalities. We generally provide industrial and commercial
    collection services to individual customers under contracts with
    terms up to three years. Our revenue from landfill operations is
    from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. In
    general, we integrate our recycling operations with our
    collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of
    recyclable materials. No one customer has individually accounted
    for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of our
    reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years.

The cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and
    includes disposal, labor, self-insurance, fuel and equipment
    maintenance costs. It also includes capital costs for equipment
    and facilities. We seek operating efficiencies by controlling
    the movement of waste from the point of collection through
    disposal. During December 2008, subsequent to our acquisition of
    Allied, approximately 67% of the total volume of waste we
    collected was disposed of at landfills that we own or operate.

Our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of
    capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure
    and post-closure, and the legal and administrative costs of
    ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses
    include leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and
    groundwater monitoring and system maintenance, interim cap
    maintenance, and costs associated with the application of daily
    cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development
    costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to
    cell development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs
    are capitalized, and charged to expense based on the consumption
    of cubic yards of available airspace. These costs include all



costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation,
    natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate
    collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and
    monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring
    wells, and other costs associated with the acquisition and
    development of the site. Obligations associated with final
    capping, closure and post-closure are capitalized, and amortized
    on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed.

Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and
    accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense
    capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate
    to changes in costs, available airspace, inflation and
    applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include
    changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes
    due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we
    believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted.

Summarized financial information concerning our reportable
    segments for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
    2006 is shown in the following table (in millions, except

Our operations are managed and reviewed through four geographic
    regions that we designate as our reportable segments. We
    acquired Allied on December 5, 2008, and, due to the timing
    of the acquisition, management reviewed and we have presented
    Allied as a separate reportable segment in our



consolidated financial statements. In addition, during the first
    quarter of 2008, we consolidated our Southwestern operations
    into our Western Region and, accordingly, the historical
    operating results of our Southwestern operations have been
    consolidated into our Western Region.

2008 compared to 2007:

§

Eastern Region.

Revenue in our Eastern
    Region decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to a decrease
    in volumes in all lines of business and a decrease in the prices
    of commodities. The decrease in volume is primarily attributable
    to less temporary work and lower transfer station volumes due to
    less construction activity. Landfill volumes were also lower.
    This decrease in revenue was partially offset by price increases
    in all lines of business.

The operating loss in 2008 includes remediation charges of
    $99.9 million related to estimated costs to comply with the
    F&Os issued by the OEPA and the AOC issued by the EPA
    related to our Countywide facility and an impairment charge of
    $75.9 million related to the anticipated loss of permitted
    airspace at Countywide based upon recent negotiations with the
    OEPA and EPA. It also includes $11.0 million of settlement
    reserves for certain legal matters.

Operating income for 2007 includes a $44.6 million charge
    to operating expenses associated with environmental conditions
    at Countywide.

§

Central Region.

Revenue increased
    during 2008 compared to 2007 due to price increases in all lines
    of business. This increase in revenue was partially offset by
    lower volumes in all lines of business and lower prices of
    commodities due to the economic slowdown.

Operating margins decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to
    an adjustment to landfill amortization expense associated with
    SFAS 143 during 2007.

§

Southern Region.

Price increases in all
    lines of business resulted in an increase in revenue during 2008
    compared to 2007. This increase in revenue was partially offset
    by volume declines in our industrial and commercial collection
    lines of business and at our landfills and transfer stations.

Operating margins decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to
    higher fuel costs partially offset by higher revenue, lower
    disposal costs and lower insurance costs.

§

Western Region.

Price increases in all
    lines of business resulted in an increase in revenue during 2008
    compared to 2007. This increase in revenue was partially offset
    by a decrease in industrial collection, residential collection,
    transfer station and landfill volumes resulting from the
    economic slowdown. This increase in revenue was also partially
    offset by lower prices of commodities and by the sale of our
    Texas-based compost, mulch and soil business in November 2007.

Operating income in 2008 includes a $34.0 million charge
    related to estimated costs to comply with a Consent Decree and
    Settlement Agreement signed with the EPA, the Bureau of Land
    Management and Clark County, Nevada related to the Sunrise
    Landfill. It also includes a $21.9 million charge recorded
    during 2008 associated with environmental conditions at our
    closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California.

Operating income in 2007 includes an $8.1 million increase
    in landfill operating costs and a $5.2 million increase in
    SFAS 143 amortization expense associated with environmental
    conditions at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa
    County, California.

§

Allied.

The operating results for
    Allied are included in the consolidated financial statements of
    Republic from the date of the acquisition of December 5,
    2008. These results include $17.2 million of bad debt
    expense related to conforming Allied’s calculation of
    allowance for doubtful accounts with ours and providing for
    specific bankruptcy exposures, $3.9 million of
    restructuring charges for severance and other employee
    termination benefits and $5.6 million of amortization
    expense associated with the intangible assets recorded as a
    result of our merger.



§

Corporate Entities.

The increase in
    operating costs for the Corporate Entities includes professional
    fees, distributions under cash and equity award programs, and
    relocation, severance and other employee termination benefits
    related to our merger with Allied.

2007 compared
    to 2006:

§

Eastern Region.

Revenue increased
    during 2007 compared to 2006 due to price increases in all lines
    of business and an increase in the prices of commodities. This
    increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volumes in the
    industrial collection line of business primarily due to less
    temporary work, and lower landfill volumes. These lower volumes
    resulted from less favorable weather conditions and a general
    slowdown in residential construction during 2007.

Operating margins decreased from 16.2% to 11.5% primarily
    because of a $44.6 million charge to operating income
    associated with environmental conditions at our Countywide
    facility.

§

Central Region.

Revenue increased
    during 2007 compared to 2006 due to price increases in all lines
    of business and an increase in the prices of commodities. This
    increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volumes in the
    commercial collection, industrial collection and landfill lines
    of business. Lower volumes in the collection lines of business
    are primarily due to less favorable weather conditions during
    2007 and the economic slowdown. Lower landfill volumes are
    primarily due to our decision to limit our acceptance of certain
    waste streams.

Operating margins increased due to higher revenue, lower
    disposal costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense
    associated with SFAS 143. This increase in operating
    margins was partially offset by increases in risk insurance and
    landfill operating costs.

§

Southern Region.

Price increases in all
    lines of business, increases in the prices of commodities, and
    increases in commercial collection, residential collection and
    landfill volumes resulted in an increase in revenue during 2007
    compared to 2006. This increase in revenue was partially offset
    by lower industrial collection volumes. These lower volumes are
    primarily due to a slowdown in residential construction in 2007,
    and hurricane-related work that was performed during 2006.

Operating margins increased primarily due to higher revenue,
    lower disposal costs due to drier weather, lower truck and
    equipment maintenance costs, and lower labor costs.

§

Western Region.

Price increases in all
    lines of business, volume increases in the residential
    collection line of business and increases in the prices of
    commodities resulted in an increase in revenue during 2007
    compared to 2006. This increase in revenue was partially offset
    by a decrease in industrial collection and landfill volumes
    resulting from a general slowdown in residential construction in
    2007.

Operating margins decreased because of an $8.1 million
    increase in landfill operating costs and a $5.2 million
    increase in SFAS 143 amortization expense associated with
    environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in
    Contra Costa County, California.

§

Corporate Entities.

The decrease in
    operating costs from 2006 to 2007 is due to a $4.3 million
    reduction to our allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during
    2007 as a result of refining our estimate of our allowance based
    on our historical collection experience, which was partially
    offset by increases in operating costs associated with the
    expansion of our business.

2008 Business
    Performance

During 2008, our internal revenue growth was 2.5% with a 4.0%
    increase in core price offset by a 3.9% decrease in core volume.
    During 2008, we experienced lower volumes in all of our lines of
    business due to the economic slowdown. Revenue growth from fuel
    surcharges and environmental fees was 1.8% and .4%,
    respectively. In addition, our merger with Allied in December
    2008 resulted in a 13.4% increase in revenue.



The cost of fuel increased significantly during the summer and
    fall of 2008. The economic slowdown helped to moderate fuel
    prices in the later part of the year. Fuel ended the year at
    levels consistent with those experienced during 2007. This
    decrease in fuel prices was offset by corresponding declines in
    fuel surcharges and, therefore, did not significantly improve
    our profitability.

Also during 2008, prices for recycling commodities declined in
    response to a decline in global demand. Although we hedged a
    portion of our commodity sales, declines in commodity prices
    have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our
    profitability.

2009 Business
    Initiatives

Our business initiatives for 2009 focus on the timely
    integration of our operations with Allied’s, while
    remaining focused on the aspects of our operations that have
    made us successful. Our initiatives include:

§

Safety.

Safety remains our highest priority for all
    of our employees. Both Republic and Allied have long-standing
    commitments to ensuring a safe working environment for our
    employees. Our commitment to safety is unwavering and is evident
    in our mission statement. We will continue to foster a safe work
    environment for our employees and the communities that we
    service. In addition, we will continue to reward our people for
    operating in a safe and conscientious manner.

§

Service Delivery.

We believe that our focus on
    service delivery differentiates us from others in the waste
    management industry. During 2009, we will continue to exceed our
    customers’ expectations through the consistent delivery of
    high quality service. We will also focus on increasing the
    efficiency of our service delivery. We believe that our
    attention to efficient delivery of high quality customer service
    will enhance customer retention.

§

Pricing.

We remain dedicated to effective pricing
    practices. Our commitment to competitive pricing helps ensure
    that fees charged to our customers are fair relative to the
    services they receive. Our focus on pricing also creates
    long-term value for our company and our stockholders.

§

Integration.

Our merger with Allied provides us with
    a unique opportunity to integrate two successful operations and
    create a

best-in-class

waste management company. During 2009, we will be keenly focused
    on the seamless integration of our operations and cultures.

§

Synergy Capture.

During 2009, we will remain
    committed to achieving and surpassing our approximately
    $150.0 million synergy goal. We have already developed a
    detailed plan for realizing this goal which includes
    participation at all levels throughout the company from the
    drivers of our fleet of collection vehicles to our board of
    directors. This plan anticipates achieving $100.0 million
    of annual

run-rate

integration synergies by the end of fiscal 2009. We expect to
    incur approximately $135.0 million and $55.0 million
    of one-time costs directly attributable to achieving our synergy
    goal during 2009 and 2010, respectively. We believe that our
    synergy goal is achievable despite the economic slowdown.

§

Return on Invested Capital.

Enhancing our return on
    invested capital is the culmination of all our 2009 initiatives.
    We will maintain our focus on disciplined growth and investing
    in our business to ensure increasing capital returns and
    shareholder value.

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Years Ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006

Our net income was $73.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, or $.37 per diluted share, compared to
    $290.2 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in 2007 and
    $279.6 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, in 2006.

In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a

3-for-2

stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effective on
    March 16, 2007, to stockholders of record as of
    March 5, 2007. We distributed approximately
    64.5 million shares from treasury stock to effect the stock
    split. Our shares, per share data and weighted average common
    and common equivalent shares outstanding have been retroactively
    adjusted for all periods to reflect the stock split.



During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a
    number of charges and other expenses that impacted our pre-tax
    income, net income and diluted earnings per share. These items

Revenue.

Revenue was $3.7 billion,
    $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Revenue
    increased $508.9 million, or 16.0%, from 2007 to 2008. Our
    acquisition of Allied in December 2008 contributed
    $463.7 million to this increase in revenue. Revenue



increased by $105.6 million, or 3.4%, from 2006 to 2007.

§


: During the year ended December 31, 2008, our
    core revenue growth continued to benefit from a broad-based
    pricing initiative. In addition, 14.7% of our revenue growth is
    due to our acquisition of Allied in December 2008. Revenue
    growth also benefited from higher fuel surcharges and
    environmental fees. However, during 2008 we experienced lower
    prices for commodities. We also experienced a decrease in core
    volumes primarily due to lower commercial and industrial
    collection volumes and lower landfill volumes resulting from the
    slowdown in the economy. We expect to continue to experience
    lower volumes until economic conditions improve.

§

2007:

During the year ended December 31, 2007, our
    revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from a
    broad-based pricing initiative. Our revenue growth also
    benefited from higher prices for commodities. However, we
    experienced a decrease in core volume growth primarily due to
    lower industrial collection and landfill volumes resulting from
    the slowdown in residential construction.

§

2006:

During the year ended December 31, 2006, our
    revenue growth continued to benefit from our broad-based pricing
    initiative. We experienced core volume growth in our collection
    and landfill lines of business. This core volume growth was
    partially offset by hurricane

clean-up

efforts that took place during the fourth quarter of 2005.

§

2009 Outlook:

We anticipate internal revenue from core
    operations to decrease approximately 4.0% during 2009. This
    decrease is the expected net of growth in core pricing of
    approximately 4.0% and an expected decrease in volume of
    approximately 8.0%. Our projections assume no deterioration or
    improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during
    the fourth quarter of 2008. However, our internal growth may
    remain flat or may decline in 2009 depending on economic
    conditions and our success in implementing pricing initiatives.

Cost of Operations.

Cost of operations was
    $2.4 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, or,
    as a percentage of revenue, 65.6%, 63.1% and 62.7%, for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007
    period is primarily a result of our acquisition of Allied in
    December 2008. The remaining increase in cost of operations in
    aggregate dollars and the increase as a percentage of revenue is
    primarily due to charges we recorded during 2008 of
    $98.0 million related to estimated costs to comply with
    F&Os issued by the OEPA and the AOC issued by the EPA in
    response to environmental conditions at our Countywide facility
    in Ohio, $21.9 million related to environmental conditions
    at our closed disposal facility



in Contra Costa County, California and $34.0 million
    related to environmental conditions at the Sunrise Landfill. The
    increase in cost of operations and as a percentage of our
    revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the
    comparable 2006 period is primarily a result of the
    $41.0 million charge we recorded in cost of operations
    related to environmental conditions at our Countywide facility
    and an $8.1 million charge related to our closed disposal
    facility in Contra Costa County, California.

The following table summarizes the major components of our cost
    of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
    and 2006 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our
    revenue:

A description of our cost categories is as follows:

§

Subcontractor, disposal and third-party fees include costs such
    as third-party disposal, transportation of waste, host fees and
    cost of goods sold. The decrease in such expenses as a
    percentage of revenue for all periods presented is primarily due
    to higher revenue resulting from improved pricing. In addition,
    the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007
    period is also due to lower costs of goods sold associated with
    the sale of our lower margin, Texas-based compost, mulch and
    soil business in November 2007. During 2007, drier weather,
    particularly in our Southern Region, resulted in lower disposal
    costs. The reduction in costs were partially offset by
    additional third-party hauling costs incurred during 2006
    associated with our assuming responsibility for hauling waste
    from the city of Toronto to one of our landfills in Michigan.

§

Labor and benefits include costs such as wages, salaries,
    payroll taxes and health benefits for our frontline service
    employees and their supervisors. Such expenses as a percentage
    of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus the
    comparable 2007 period decreased due to higher revenue resulting
    from improved pricing and lower labor costs associated with
    volume decreases in various lines of business. The increase in
    such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is due
    to increases in benefits including health insurance. In
    addition, during December 2006, we assumed responsibility for
    hauling a portion of our transfer station volumes to one of our
    landfills. This hauling service reduced our third-party fees and
    increased various other cost categories, the most significant of
    which was labor.

§

Maintenance and operating includes costs such as fuel, parts,
    shop labor and benefits, third-party repairs, and landfill
    monitoring and operating. The increase in such expenses in
    aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period
    is primarily a result of the $98.0 million charge related
    to the Countywide facility, the $21.9 million charge
    related to our closed disposal facility in California and the
    $34.0 million charge related to the Sunrise Landfill. This
    increase is partially offset by the $41.0 million of
    charges related to our Countywide facility and the
    $8.1 million charge related to our closed disposal facility
    in California recorded during 2007. The increase in such
    expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is
    primarily due to an increase in landfill operating costs
    resulting from the charges recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 of $41.0 million related to our
    Countywide facility and $8.1 million charge related to our
    closed disposal facility in California. Excluding these charges
    in the respective periods, the decrease in expenses in aggregate
    dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 are primarily due to increases
    in fuel prices. Our average cost of fuel per gallon increased
    approximately 32% from $2.76 per gallon during 2007 to $3.63 per
    gallon during 2008, and increased approximately 7% from $2.59
    per gallon during 2006 to $2.76 per gallon for 2007. Current
    average fuel prices are $2.12 per gallon.



§

Insurance and other includes costs such as workers’
    compensation, auto and general liability insurance, property
    taxes, property maintenance and utilities. The increase in such
    expenses as a percentage of revenue for all of the years
    presented is primarily due to an increase in the severity of our
    automobile insurance claims.

The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and
    may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by
    other companies. As such, care should be taken when comparing
    our cost of operations by cost component to that of other
    companies.

Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and
    Equipment.

Depreciation, amortization and depletion
    expenses for property and equipment were $342.3 million,
    $299.0 million and $289.0 million, or, as a percentage
    of revenue, 9.3%, 9.4% and 9.4%, for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 is
    primarily due to our acquisition of Allied in December 2008. The
    decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007
    period is primarily due to a reduction of amortization expense
    associated with lower landfill volumes. The increase in such
    expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is
    partially due to $3.3 million of adjustments to landfill
    amortization expense for changes in estimates and assumptions
    related to our reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations
    under SFAS 143. In addition, during the year ended
    December 31, 2007, we incurred approximately
    $3.3 million of additional depletion and amortization
    expense associated with a reduction of estimated remaining
    available airspace at our Countywide facility. Depreciation
    expense during 2007 was also slightly higher due to our ongoing
    truck and equipment replacement program.

Amortization of Intangible Assets.

Intangible assets
    that have a finite life and are amortized generally consist of
    customer relationships, long-term contracts and covenants not to
    compete. Expenses for amortization of intangible assets were
    $11.8 million, $6.5 million and $7.0 million, or,
    as a percentage of revenue, .3%, .2% and .2% for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a
    percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008
    versus the comparable 2007 and 2006 periods is due to the
    amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of our
    acquisition of Allied. We expect this acquisition will increase
    our intangible asset amortization expense by approximately
    $65.0 million in 2009.

Accretion Expense.

Accretion expense was
    $23.9 million, $17.1 million and $15.7 million,
    or, as a percentage of revenue, .7%, .5% and .5% for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2008 versus
    the comparable 2007 and 2006 periods is primarily due to an
    increase in asset retirement obligations associated with our
    acquisition of Allied. The asset retirement obligations acquired
    from Allied are recorded using a discount rate of 9.75%, which
    is higher than the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate we have used
    historically to record such obligations. Our accretion expense
    in 2009 will reflect the increase in asset retirement
    obligations recorded in the acquisition of Allied and the impact
    of using a higher overall average discount rate for recording
    these liabilities.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
    were $434.7 million, $313.7 million and
    $315.0 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 11.8%, 9.9%
    and 10.3%, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively.

The increase in such expenses both in aggregate dollars and as a
    percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008
    versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to
    $14.2 million of bad debt expense related to conforming
    Allied’s methodology for recording the allowance for
    doubtful accounts on accounts receivable with ours and
    $5.4 million to provide for specific bankruptcy exposures.
    This increase is also due to $24.3 million of settlement
    charges related to our estimates of the outcome of various legal
    matters.

Excluding these costs, selling, general and administrative
    expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have
    been $390.8 million, or 10.6% as a percentage of revenue.
    The increase in selling,



general and administrative expenses (excluding the costs
    mentioned above) in aggregate dollars during 2008 versus the
    comparable 2007 period is primarily due to our merger with
    Allied. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue
    for 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to
    our merger with Allied and a $4.3 million reduction in our
    allowance for doubtful accounts which we recorded during the
    year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of refining our
    estimate for our allowance based on our historical collection
    experience.

The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period
    is primarily due to the expansion of our business. The decrease
    in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for 2007 versus 2006
    is primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation costs
    and the $4.3 million reduction to our allowance for
    doubtful accounts recorded during 2007.

Upon the completion of the integration of Allied, our goal is to
    maintain our selling, general and administrative costs at no
    more than 10.0% of revenue, which we believe is appropriate
    given our existing business platform.

Asset Impairments.

During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we recorded a $75.9 million charge
    related to the impairment of our Countywide facility. This
    impairment relates to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace
    associated with complying with F&Os issued by the OEPA and
    the AOC issued by the EPA based upon recent negotiations with
    the OEPA and the EPA. During the year ended December 31,
    2008, we recorded a loss of $6.1 million for expected
    losses on asset divestitures mandated by the DOJ. Also during
    the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded
    $7.8 million of other impairment charges, consisting
    primarily of charges related to our former corporate
    headquarters in South Florida.

Restructuring Charges.

During the year ended December 31,
    2008, we incurred $82.7 million of restructuring charges
    associated with integrating our operations with Allied. These
    charges primarily consist of severance and other employee
    termination and relocation benefits and consulting fees paid to
    outside parties.

Operating Income.

Operating income was
    $283.2 million, $536.0 million and
    $519.5 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 7.7%, 16.9%
    and 16.9%, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The reduction in operating income as a
    percentage of revenue for 2008 versus the comparable 2007 and
    2006 periods is primarily due to the remediation, asset
    impairment and restructuring charges noted above.

Interest Expense.

We incurred interest expense
    primarily on our credit facilities, senior notes and tax-exempt
    bonds. Interest expense was $131.9 million,
    $94.8 million and $95.8 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    increase in interest expense during the year ended
    December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is
    primarily due to the additional debt we acquired as a
    result of our acquisition of Allied. In addition, during
    December 2008, we incurred approximately $10.1 million of
    non-cash interest expense. This expense relates primarily to a
    $624.3 million discount we recorded to fair value the debt
    we acquired from Allied that is being amortized generally over
    the term of the related debt. It also relates to accretion
    expenses associated with discounted environmental and risk
    insurance reserves.

Capitalized interest was $2.6 million, $3.0 million
    and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Interest Income and Other Income (Expense),
    Net.

Interest income and other income, net of other
    expense, was $8.0 million, $26.9 million and
    $20.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The amount in 2007 is primarily due
    to a $12.5 million gain related to the sale of our compost,
    mulch and soil business in Texas.

Income Taxes.

Our provision for income taxes was
    $85.4 million, $177.9 million and $164.1 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 53.6%, 38.0% and
    37.0% for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we
    incurred several expenses that were not tax deductible as a
    result of the



merger with Allied. In addition, lower pre-tax earnings
    contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate. During
    the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a net tax
    benefit of $4.8 million in our provision for income taxes
    related to the resolution of various income tax matters,
    including the effective completion of Internal Revenue Service
    audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001
    through 2004. Income tax expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 includes a $5.1 million benefit
    related to the resolution of various income tax matters,
    including the effective completion of Internal Revenue Service
    audits for the years 1998 through 2000.

Changes in engineering estimates
    typically include minor modifications to the available disposal
    capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity
    calculations resulting from updated information. Changes in
    design typically include significant modifications to a
    landfill’s footprint or vertical slopes.



As of December 31, 2008, we owned or operated 213 active
    solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity
    estimated to be 4.9 billion in-place cubic yards. Total
    available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated
    permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion
    airspace. These estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial
    surveys. As of December 31, 2008, total available disposal
    capacity is estimated to be 4.5 billion in-place cubic
    yards of permitted airspace plus .4 billion in-place cubic
    yards of probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included
    in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion
    airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total
    available disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion
    criteria. See Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies,

and Note 8,

Landfill and Environmental
    Costs

, to our consolidated financial statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for further information.

During 2008, total available airspace increased by a net
    3.2 billion cubic yards due the merger with Allied in
    December, which contributed 157 active landfills
    representing 3.3 billion cubic yards of permitted and
    probable expansion airspace to our landfill assets. Excluding
    the merger with Allied, total available airspace decreased by a
    net .1 billion cubic yards primarily due to airspace
    consumed, changes in engineering estimates and changes in
    design. The decrease during 2008 due to changes in engineering
    estimates is primarily due to a reduction of remaining airspace
    at our Countywide facility. During 2007, total available
    airspace increased by a net 7.5 million cubic yards due to
    new expansions undertaken, changes in engineering estimates and
    permits granted, partially offset by airspace consumed and
    changes in design. In addition, during the year ended
    December 31, 2007, total available airspace increased as a
    result of obtaining a new contract to operate a landfill in
    Texas, which was substantially offset by a reduction resulting
    from not renewing a contract to operate a small landfill in
    Texas. Changes in design in 2007 are primarily due to a
    reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our
    Countywide facility. During 2006, total available airspace
    decreased by 33.6 million cubic yards due to airspace
    consumption, partially offset by permits granted and changes in
    engineering estimates.

At December 31, 2005, 10.1% of our total available
    airspace, or 177.7 million cubic yards, consisted of
    probable expansion airspace at nine of our landfills. At
    December 31, 2008, 7.8% of our total available airspace, or
    386.2 million cubic yards, consisted of probable expansion
    airspace at 23 of our landfills. Between December 31, 2005
    and December 31, 2008, we received permits for
    eight of our probable expansions, which demonstrates our
    continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace.

As of December 31, 2008, 23 of our landfills meet all
    of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace
    in their total available disposal capacity, 15 of which were
    added as a result of our acquisition of Allied. At projected
    annual volumes, these landfills have an estimated remaining
    average site life of 32 years, including probable expansion
    airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our
    landfills is 42 years. We have other expansion
    opportunities that are not included in our total available
    airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for
    probable expansion airspace.

The following table reflects the estimated operating lives of
    our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity
    using current annual volumes as of December 31, 2008:

Sites with expansion airspace include two landfills with

Final Capping,
    Closure and Post-Closure Costs

As of December 31, 2008, accrued final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs were $1.0 billion, of which
    $130.6 million is current and $910.0 million is
    long-term as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in
    accrued landfill and environmental costs.

Remediation and
    Other Charges for Landfill Matters

In December 2008, we recorded a preliminary purchase price
    allocation of $208.1 million for the environmental
    liabilities we acquired as part of the acquisition of Allied.
    These liabilities represent our preliminary estimate of our
    costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated
    by Allied, or sites at which Allied, or a predecessor company
    that they had acquired, had been identified as a potentially
    responsible party. The remediation of these sites is in various
    stages of completion from having received an initial notice from
    a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the
    final stages of postremedial monitoring. See Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —
    Environmental Remediation Liabilities

, to our consolidated
    financial statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for further information.

During 2007, we recorded pre-tax charges of $45.3 million
    related to estimated costs to comply with F&Os issued by
    the OEPA in response to environmental conditions at Countywide
    and to undertake certain other remedial actions that we agreed
    with the OEPA to perform, including, without limitation,
    installing a “fire” break and removing liquids from
    gas extraction wells. We also recorded $3.3 million of
    additional depletion and amortization expense during the year
    ended December 31, 2007 associated with a reduction of
    estimated remaining available airspace at this landfill as a
    result of the OEPA’s F&Os.

During 2008, Republic-Ohio, an Ohio limited liability company
    and wholly owned subsidiary of ours and parent of Countywide,
    entered into an AOC with the EPA requiring the reimbursement of
    costs incurred by the EPA and requiring Republic-Ohio to
    (a) design and install a temperature and gas monitoring
    system, (b) design and install a composite cap or cover,
    and (c) develop and implement an air monitoring program.
    The AOC became effective on April 17, 2008 and
    Republic-Ohio is complying with the terms of the AOC. We
    received additional orders from the OEPA in 2008. Based upon
    current information and engineering analyses and discussions
    with the OEPA and EPA subsequent to the signing of the
    above-mentioned agreement, we recorded an additional pre-tax
    charge for remediation costs of $98.0 million during 2008.
    These costs include placing an enhanced cap (in excess of
    Countywide’s current permit requirements) over certain
    portions of the landfill.

We have requested relief with respect to certain requirements of
    the orders received from the OEPA as we believe the requirements
    should no longer be considered essential in light of the work we
    have now agreed with the EPA to perform.

While we are vigorously pursuing financial contributions from
    third parties for our costs to comply with the F&Os and the
    additional remedial actions, we have not recorded any
    receivables for potential recoveries.

In addition, during 2008 we recorded an impairment charge of
    $75.9 million related to a reduction in our estimated
    remaining airspace at Countywide.

During 2007, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $9.6 million
    associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs
    and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats
    leachate at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County,
    California. These additional costs are attributable to a consent
    agreement with the California Department of Toxic Substance
    Control. During 2008, we recorded an additional pre-tax charge
    of $21.9 million for increases in our estimated leachate
    disposal costs and leachate treatment equipment costs at this
    facility.

On August 1, 2008, Republic Services of Southern Nevada
    (RSSN), a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, signed a Consent
    Decree and Settlement Agreement (Consent Decree) with the EPA,
    the Bureau of Land Management and Clark County, Nevada related
    to the Sunrise Landfill. Under the Consent Decree, RSSN has
    agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the Sunrise
    Landfill for which RSSN and Clark County



were otherwise jointly and severally liable. As a result, we
    recorded, based on management’s best estimates, a pre-tax
    charge of $35.0 million during 2008, of which
    $34.0 million was recorded for remediation costs associated
    with complying with the Consent Decree. RSSN is currently
    working with the Clark County Staff and Board of Commissioners
    to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the
    Consent Decree. However, we have not recorded any potential
    recoveries. The majority of this remediation liability is
    expected to be paid during 2009 and 2010.

It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the
    charges noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional
    information, to the extent that such information impacts the
    costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future
    changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the
    required actions could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

No other significant amounts were charged to income for
    remediation costs during the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006.

We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities
    through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. We accrue costs
    related to environmental remediation activities associated with
    acquisitions of properties through business combinations as a
    charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or
    landfill purchase price allocated to airspace, as appropriate.

The increase in the investment in our landfills, both in
    aggregate dollars and as an investment per cubic yard, is
    primarily due to the acquisition of Allied in December 2008.
    Landfill development cost in the above table include
    $2.6 billion of purchase price for the acquisition that has
    been allocated to the permitted and probable expansion airspace
    acquired based on its fair value as of the date of the
    acquisition. The increase in depletion, amortization and
    accretion expense from 2007 to 2008 is primarily due to
    $5.8 million of accretion expense associated with capping,
    closure and post-closure liabilities acquired from Allied. The
    asset retirement obligations acquired from Allied are recorded
    using a discount rate of 9.75%, which is higher than the rate we
    have historically used. See Note 2,

Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies,

regarding SFAS 143
    adjustments.

The increase in depletion, amortization and accretion expense
    per cubic yard of airspace consumed from 2006 to 2007 is
    partially due to an increase of $3.3 million in landfill
    amortization expense that we recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 related to reviews of landfill asset
    retirement obligations at our landfills. This increase is also
    partially due to $3.3 million of additional depletion and
    amortization expense we recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 associated with a reduction of estimated
    remaining available airspace at our Countywide facility.

During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    our weighted-average compaction rate was approximately
    1,650 pounds per cubic yard based on our three-year
    historical moving average. Our compaction rates may improve as a
    result of the settlement and decomposition of waste.

As of December 31, 2008, we expect to spend an estimated
    additional $6.1 billion on existing landfills, primarily
    related to cell construction and environmental structures, over
    their expected remaining lives. Our total expected investment,
    excluding non-depletable land, estimated to be
    $9.3 billion, or $1.89 per cubic yard, is used in
    determining our depletion and amortization expense based on
    airspace consumed using the

units-of-consumption

method.

Our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of
    revenue for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 1.0%, .1% and .3%,
    respectively. The increase in the allowance for doubtful
    accounts during the year ended December 31, 2008 versus the
    comparable 2007 period is primarily due to the following:
    $27.2 million related to the acquisition of Allied,
    $14.2 million to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts
    acquired from



Allied to conform to Republic’s accounting policies and
    $5.4 million related to providing for specific bankruptcy
    exposures. The reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts
    during the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the
    comparable 2006 period is due to an adjustment we recorded in
    2007 of $4.3 million as a result of refining our estimate
    for our allowance based on our historical collection experience.
    As of December 31, 2008, accounts receivable were
    $945.5 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of
    $65.7 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of 40,
    or 25 days net of deferred revenue. At December 31,
    2008, our accounts receivable in excess of 90 days old
    totaled $59.4 million, or 5.9% of gross receivables
    outstanding.

Our expense for self-insurance, which includes risk insurance
    and health insurance for all of our employees, as a percentage
    of revenue for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 5.5%, 5.9% and 5.4%,
    respectively. The decrease in self-insurance expense as a
    percentage of revenue for the year ended 2008 versus the
    comparable 2007 period is primarily due to lower health
    insurance costs. The increase in self-insurance expense as a
    percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007
    versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to an
    increase in the severity of our automobile insurance claims.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

The major components of changes in cash flows for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are discussed below.

Cash Flows From Operating Activities.

Cash provided
    by operating activities was $512.2 million,
    $661.3 million and $511.2 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The changes
    in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are
    primarily due to the expansion of our business, the timing of
    payments received for accounts receivable, and the timing of
    payments made for accounts payable and federal income taxes.
    Cash flow for the year ended



December 31, 2008, was negatively impacted by $132.3
    million of payments made to the IRS for interest and taxes
    related to the risk management companies matter discussed in
    Item 3.

Legal Proceed

ings. This payment was accrued by
    Allied and in our purchase accounting for the acquisition, and
    paid in December 2008 to stop further accrual of interest and
    taxes on this matter. Additionally, during the year ended
    December 31, 2006, we paid approximately $83.0 million
    in income taxes related to fiscal 2005. This tax payment had
    been deferred as a result of an IRS notice issued in response to
    Hurricane Katrina.

We use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures,
    acquisitions, dividend payments and debt repayments.

Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities.

Cash used
    in investing activities was $934.7 million,
    $260.3 million and $204.5 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash used
    in investing activities consists primarily of cash used for
    capital additions for all periods presented, cash paid, net of
    cash acquired, of $540.4 million related to the acquisition
    of Allied in 2008, cash provided by the disposition of our
    compost, mulch and soil business in Texas in 2007, and cash
    provided by a decrease in restricted cash in 2006. Capital
    additions were $386.9 million, $292.5 million and
    $326.7 million during the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash used to acquire
    businesses, net of cash acquired, was $553.8 million,
    $4.4 million and $4.9 million during the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions
    through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital
    expenditures, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit
    facilities, and tax-exempt bonds and other financings. We expect
    to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions.

Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing
    Activities.

Cash provided by financing activities was
    $469.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    and cash used in financing activities was $408.3 million
    and $409.4 million for the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, and consists primarily of purchases
    of common stock for treasury, proceeds from and payments of
    notes payable and long-term debt, proceeds from issuances of
    common stock due to stock option exercises and payments of cash
    dividends. Purchases of common stock for treasury were
    $138.4 million, $362.8 million and $492.0 million
    during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Dividends paid were
    $128.3 million, $93.9 million and $78.5 million
    during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

From 2000 through 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $2.6 billion of our common stock. As of
    December 31, 2008, we paid $2.3 billion to repurchase
    82.6 million shares of our common stock, of which
    $138.4 million was paid during 2008 to repurchase
    4.6 million shares of our common stock. The stock
    repurchase program was suspended in the second quarter of 2008
    due to the pending merger with Allied. We expect that the share
    repurchase program will continue to be suspended until at least
    2011.

We used cash on hand, cash flows from operations and proceeds
    from issuances of tax-exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures,
    repay debt and fund acquisitions. We intend to use the proceeds
    from asset divestitures in 2008 to repay debt. We intend to
    finance future dividend payments through cash on hand, cash
    flows from operations, our revolving credit facilities and other
    financings.

Financial
    Condition

At December 31, 2008, we had $68.7 million of cash and
    cash equivalents. We also had $281.9 million of restricted
    cash deposits, including $133.5 million of restricted cash
    held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities.

In conjunction with the merger with Allied, we entered into a
    $1.75 billion revolving credit facility with a group of
    banks in September 2008. The credit facility matures in
    September 2013. It was used initially at the time of the merger
    to refinance borrowings and letters of credit under
    Allied’s senior credit facility, to pay fees and expenses
    in connection therewith, and to pay fees and expenses incurred
    in connection with the merger. Since the merger, borrowings
    under the new credit facility are being used for working
    capital,



capital expenditures, letters of credit and other general
    corporate purposes. Borrowings under the $1.75 billion
    credit facility bear interest at a Base Rate, or a Eurodollar
    Rate, both terms defined in the agreements, plus an applicable
    margin based on our Debt Ratings, also a term defined in the
    agreements (see Note 9,

Debt

, to our consolidated
    financial statements included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K).

At December 31, 2008, we had $168.9 million available
    under the $1.75 billion credit facility.

In April 2007, we increased our unsecured revolving credit
    facility to $1.0 billion and extended the term to 2012. In
    September 2008, we amended the $1.0 billion credit facility
    to conform certain terms of the facility to be consistent with
    the new $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. We did not
    change the maturity date of the credit facility. Borrowings
    under the $1.0 billion credit facility bear interest at a
    Base Rate, or a Eurodollar Rate, both terms defined in the
    agreements, plus an applicable margin based on our Debt Ratings,
    also a term defined in the agreements. At December 31,
    2008, we had $229.6 million available under the
    $1.0 billion credit facility.

In May 1999, we sold $375.0 million of unsecured notes in
    the public market. These notes bear interest at 7.125% per annum
    and mature in 2009. Interest on these notes is payable
    semi-annually in May and November. The notes were offered at a
    discount of $.5 million. In March 2005, we exchanged
    $275.7 million of our outstanding 7.125% notes due
    2009 for new notes due 2035. The new notes bear interest at
    6.086%. We paid a premium of $27.6 million related to the
    exchange. This premium is being amortized over the life of the
    new notes using the effective yield method.

In August 2001, we sold $450.0 million of unsecured notes
    in the public market. The notes bear interest at 6.75% and
    mature in 2011. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually
    in February and August. The notes were offered at a discount of
    $2.6 million.

As part of our acquisition of Allied in December 2008, we
    acquired Allied’s then outstanding senior notes totaling
    $4.25 billion, with interest rates ranging from 5.75% to
    7.875% and maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2017,
    $99.5 million and $360.0 million of Allied’s
    debentures with interest rates of 9.25% and 7.40% and maturity
    dates of 2021 and 2035, respectively, and $230.0 million of
    Allied’s 4.25% convertible debentures due 2034.

We also acquired $400.0 million of receivables secured
    loans, which bear interest at a market based interest rate plus
    a margin as defined in the agreement. We intend to renew the
    accounts receivable securitization program when it matures in
    May 2009; however, if we are unable to renew this facility at
    favorable terms, we will refinance any then outstanding amounts
    with our existing credit facilities.

In addition, we acquired $527.0 million of tax-exempt bonds
    with interest rates ranging from 5.15% to 11.50% and maturity
    dates ranging from 2010 to 2031, and other debt of
    $106.7 million.

The total fair value of the debt acquired in the acquisition was
    $5.4 billion as of the effective date of the merger. See
    Note 9,

Debt

to our consolidated financial
    statements under Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for further information regarding the debt acquired from Allied.

In order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest
    rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with
    investment grade-rated financial institutions. Our outstanding
    swap agreements have a total notional value of
    $210.0 million and require us to pay interest at floating
    rates based on changes in LIBOR and receive interest at a fixed
    rate of 6.75%. Our swap agreements mature in August 2011.

At December 31, 2008, we had $1.3 billion of
    tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings outstanding of
    which $527.0 million were acquired in the acquisition of
    Allied in 2008 and $207.4 million were issued during 2008
    for Republic projects. Borrowings under these bonds and other
    financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest
    rates at the prevailing market ranging from 3.25% to 11.50% at
    December 31, 2008 and have maturities ranging from 2010 to
    2037. As of December 31, 2008, we had $133.5 million
    of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax-exempt bonds and
    other tax-exempt financings. This restricted cash will be used
    to reimburse capital expenditures under the terms of the
    agreements.



We intend to use excess cash on hand, cash from operating
    activities and proceeds from the asset divestitures to repay
    debt. We believe that our excess cash, cash from operating
    activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities
    provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our
    anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come
    due. Despite the current economic conditions, we believe that we
    will be able to raise additional debt or equity financing, if
    necessary.

Credit
    Rating

We have received investment grade credit ratings. As of
    December 31, 2008, our senior debt was rated BBB, Baa3, and
    BBB- by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Inc.,
    Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch, Inc.,
    respectively.

Fuel
    Hedges

We use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to
    manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices and other
    commodity prices. We have entered into multiple option
    agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases and other
    commodity prices. Under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(SFAS 133), the options qualified for, and were
    designated as, effective hedges of changes in the prices of
    forecasted diesel fuel purchases (fuel hedges).

We have the following fuel hedges outstanding at
    December 31, 2008:

If the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon
    of diesel fuel (average price) as published by the Department of
    Energy exceeds the contract price per gallon, we receive the
    difference between the average price and the contract price
    (multiplied by the notional gallons) from the counter-party. If
    the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of
    diesel fuel is less than the contract price per gallon, we pay
    the difference to the counter-party.

The fair values of our fuel hedges are obtained from third-party
    counter-parties and are determined using standard option
    valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being
    based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in
    the fair value hierarchy). The aggregated fair values of the
    outstanding fuel hedges at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were
    $11.7 million and $11.4 million, respectively, and
    have been recorded in other current liabilities and other
    current assets in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively.

In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portions of the
    changes in fair values as of December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007, net of tax, of $7.1 million and
    $6.9 million, respectively, have been recorded in
    stockholders’ equity as components of accumulated other
    comprehensive income. The ineffective portions of the changes in
    fair values as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were
    immaterial and have been recorded in other income (expense), net
    in  our consolidated statements of income. Realized gains of
    $5.9 million and realized losses of $1.6 million and
    $1.3 million related to these fuel hedges are included in
    cost of operations in our consolidated statements of income for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Commodity
    Hedges

We use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to
    manage our exposure to changes in prices of certain commodities.
    We have entered into multiple agreements related to certain
    forecasted



commodity sales. Under SFAS 133, the options qualified for,
    and were designated as, effective hedges of changes in the
    prices of certain forecasted commodity sales (commodity hedges).

If the price per short ton of the hedging instrument (average
    price) as reported on the Official Board Market is less than the
    contract price per short ton, we receive the difference between
    the average price and the contract price (multiplied by the
    notional short tons) from the counter-party. If the price of the
    commodity exceeds the contract price per short ton, we pay the
    difference to the counter-party.

The fair values of our commodity hedges are obtained from a
    third-party counter-party and are determined using standard
    option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices
    being based on those observed in underlying markets
    (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). The aggregated fair
    value of the outstanding commodity hedges at December 31,
    2008 was an asset of $8.8 million and has been recorded in
    other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet. In
    accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portions of the
    changes in fair values as of December 31, 2008, net of tax,
    of $5.3 million have been recorded in stockholders’
    equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
    The ineffective portion of the changes in fair values as of
    December 31, 2008 was immaterial and has been recorded in
    other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of
    income.

In addition to the above, we have unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2008 of $611.9 million of which we expect
    to settle approximately $10.0 million to $20.0 million
    within the following twelve months.  Due to the



uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows
    associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2008, we are unable to make reasonably
    reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements.

We also have letters of credit of $1.7 billion outstanding
    under our revolving credit facilities and $.1 billion
    outstanding under other agreements at December 31, 2008.

Debt covenants.

Our revolving credit facilities
    contain financial covenants. We have the ability to pay
    dividends and to repurchase common stock provided that we are in
    compliance with these covenants. At December 31, 2008, we
    were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under
    our revolving credit facilities. We were also in compliance with
    the non-financial covenants of the indentures relating to our
    senior notes as of December 31, 2008.

On December 10, 2008, we received the requisite consents
    for a previously announced consent solicitation to amend the
    supplemental indentures governing certain outstanding debt
    securities of Allied Waste North America, Inc. (AWNA). The
    amendment to each supplemental indenture modified the ongoing
    reporting obligations required of Allied. Under the amended
    supplemental indentures, the ongoing reporting obligations may
    be satisfied by Republic.

The collateral that had secured the AWNA senior notes and the
    BFI debentures equally and ratably with the Allied bank credit
    facility was released upon the completion of the merger with
    Allied and the repayment of that facility.

Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under
    our revolving credit facilities, as well as the occurrence of
    certain material adverse events, would constitute defaults and
    would allow the lenders under the revolving credit facilities to
    accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related
    agreements. This could also have an adverse impact on
    availability of financial assurances. In addition, maturity
    acceleration on the revolving credit facilities constitutes an
    event of default under our other debt instruments, including our
    senior notes and, therefore, our senior notes would also be
    subject to acceleration of maturity. If such acceleration of
    maturities were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity
    available to repay the indebtedness. We would likely have to
    seek an amendment under our revolving credit facilities for
    relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with
    proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, or asset
    sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend the revolving
    credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such
    obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated.

Financial assurance.

We are required to provide
    financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of
    other entities under applicable environmental regulations
    relating to our landfill operations for capping, closure and
    post-closure costs, and related to our performance under certain
    collection, landfill and transfer station contracts. We satisfy
    these financial assurance requirements by providing surety
    bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies or trust deposits.
    The amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping,
    closure and post-closure costs is determined by applicable state
    environmental regulations. The financial assurance requirements
    for capping, closure and post-closure costs may be associated
    with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill.
    Generally, states will require a third-party engineering
    specialist to determine the estimated capping, closure and
    post-closure costs that are used to determine the required
    amount of financial assurance for a landfill. The amount of
    financial assurance required can, and generally will, differ
    from the obligation determined and recorded under GAAP. The
    amount of the financial assurance requirements related to
    contract performance varies by contract.

Additionally, we are required to provide financial assurance for
    our insurance program and collateral for certain performance
    obligations. We do not expect a material increase in financial
    assurance requirements during 2009, although the mix of
    financial assurance instruments may change.

These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of
    business and are not debt of our company. Since we currently
    have no liability for these financial assurance instruments,
    they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
    However, we record capping, closure and post-closure liabilities
    and self-insurance liabilities as they are incurred. The
    underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments,
    in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance
    sheets, would be



recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill
    our related obligations. We do not expect this to occur.

Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other
    than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that
    are not classified as debt. We do not guarantee any third-party
    debt.

Free Cash
    Flow

We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in
    accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities
    less purchases of property and equipment, plus proceeds from
    sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated
    statements of cash flows.

Our free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006 is calculated as follows (in millions):

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008 was
    negatively impacted by $132.3 million of payments made to
    the IRS for interest and taxes related to the risk management
    companies matter discussed in Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

. This payment was accrued by Allied and included
    in our purchase accounting allocation for the acquisition, and
    paid in December 2008 to stop further accrual of interest and
    taxes on this matter.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008 was
    positively impacted due to approximately $32.0 million of
    federal tax payments being deferred until February 2009 as a
    result of our merger with Allied.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2007 was
    higher than anticipated due to lower than expected purchases of
    property and equipment, higher deferred income taxes and lower
    payments for asset retirement obligations.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
    negatively affected by an $83.0 million federal tax payment
    for 2005 that had been deferred until February 2006 as a result
    of an IRS notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina.

Purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our
    consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the
    free cash flow above represent amounts paid during the period
    for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and
    equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows
    to property and equipment received during the period for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is as follows
    (in millions):

The adjustments noted above do not affect either our net change
    in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated
    statements of cash flows or our free cash flow.



We believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides
    useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by
    operating activities after expenditures for property and
    equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment.
    It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial
    strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets
    to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital
    assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services
    provided, maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing
    debt, paying cash dividends, and maintaining and improving our
    market position through business optimization. In addition, free
    cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation. The
    presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Free
    cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for
    discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain
    expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such
    as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our
    definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly
    titled measures presented by other companies.

Contingencies

For a description of our commitments and contingencies, see
    Note 10,

Income Taxes,

and Note 16,

Commitments and Contingencies

, to our consolidated
    financial statements included under Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Critical
    Accounting Judgments and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with GAAP and necessarily include certain estimates
    and judgments made by management. The following is a list of
    accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in
    understanding our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows and that may require management to make
    subjective or complex judgments about matters that are
    inherently uncertain. Such critical accounting policies,
    estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating
    segments.

We have noted examples of the residual accounting and business
    risks inherent in the accounting for these areas. Residual
    accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks
    that we face after the application of our policies and processes
    that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast.

Accounting for
    the Acquisition of Allied

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase
    method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. The purchase
    method of accounting requires that the purchase price paid for
    an acquisition be allocated to the assets and liabilities
    acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the
    effective date of the acquisition, with the excess of the
    purchase price over the net assets acquired being recorded as
    goodwill. The consolidated financial statements of the acquirer
    include the operating results of the acquired business from the
    date of the acquisition, and are not retroactively restated to
    include the historical position or the results of operations of
    the acquired business. These estimates are revised during the
    allocation period when the information necessary to finalize the
    fair value estimates is received and analyzed, or if information
    regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and
    quantify the assets and liabilities acquired.

Republic is in the process of valuing all of the assets and
    liabilities acquired in our acquisition of Allied. Until we have
    completed our valuation process, there may be adjustments to our
    estimates of fair values and the resulting preliminary purchase
    price allocation reflected in our consolidated financial
    statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    The significant areas of accounting where estimates of fair
    values are reflected in our consolidated financial statements
    include landfills and other property and equipment, other
    intangible assets, landfill asset retirement obligations, legal
    and environmental reserves, self-insurance reserves, income
    taxes, other non-current assets and long-term obligations, and
    assets held for sale. Our consolidated financial statements also
    include our estimates of restructuring costs incurred through
    December 31, 2008, a portion of which will be paid in
    future periods.

Changes in our estimates of fair values may impact our results
    of operations in future periods.



Residual risks:

§

The residual risks identified below related to critical
    accounting judgments and estimates are relevant to the fair
    value estimation processes for acquisitions. For discussion of
    other significant residual risks inherent in the accounting for
    acquisitions, see Item 1A.

Risk Factors

.

Landfill
    Accounting

Landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are
    not discussed further herein.

Our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two
    categories, each of which requires accounting judgments and
    estimates:

§

Landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset.

§

Landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping, closure
    and post-closure liabilities which result in a corresponding
    landfill retirement asset.

Landfill
    Development Costs

We use life-cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of
    the site. In life-cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and
    construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based
    on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace.
    Obligations associated with final capping, closure and
    post-closure are also capitalized, and amortized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are
    developed at least annually by engineers.

Site permits.

In order to develop, construct and
    operate a landfill, we are required to obtain permits from
    various regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal
    levels. The permitting process requires an initial siting study
    to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill
    operations. The initial studies are reviewed by our
    environmental management group and then submitted to the
    regulatory agencies for approval. During the development stage
    we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection
    but prior to the receipt of all required permits if we believe
    that it is probable that the site will be permitted.

Residual risks:

§

Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause
    changes to the landfill site permitting process. These changes
    could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain
    the landfill permit.

§

Studies performed could be inaccurate, which could result in the
    denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting
    assumptions. Conditions could exist that were not identified in
    the study, which may make the location not feasible for a
    landfill and could result in the denial of a permit. Denial or
    revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the
    landfill asset.

§

Actions by neighboring parties, private citizen groups or others
    to oppose our efforts to obtain, maintain or expand permits
    could result in denial, revocation or suspension of a permit,
    which could adversely impact the economic viability of the
    landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill. As
    a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit, improved
    technical information as a project progresses, or changes in the
    anticipated economics associated with a project, we may decide
    to reduce the scope of or abandon a project which could result
    in an asset impairment.

Technical landfill design.

Upon receipt of initial
    regulatory approval, technical landfill designs are prepared.
    The technical designs, which include the detailed specifications
    to develop and construct all components of the landfill,
    including the types and quantities of materials that will be
    required, are reviewed by our environmental management group.
    The technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies
    for approval. Upon approval of the technical designs, the
    regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the
    landfill.



Residual risks:

§

Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require
    changes in the landfill technical design. These changes could
    make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards.

§

Technical design requirements, as approved, may need
    modifications at some future point in time.

§

Technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in
    increased construction costs, difficulty in obtaining a permit
    or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill
    development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not
    appropriate.

Permitted and probable landfill disposal
    capacity.

Included in the technical designs are factors
    that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill.
    These factors include the area over which the landfill will be
    developed, the depth of excavation, the height of the landfill
    elevation and the angle of the side-slope construction. The
    disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards.
    This measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal
    capacity expressed in tons based on a site-specific expected
    density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the
    landfill.

Residual risks:

§

Estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of
    changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements.

§

The density of waste may vary due to variations in operating
    conditions, including waste compaction practices, site design,
    climate and the nature of the waste.

§

Capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is
    measured in tons. The number of tons per cubic yard varies by
    type of waste.

Development costs.

The types of costs that are
    detailed in the technical design specifications generally
    include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction
    of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas
    collection systems and monitoring probes, installation of
    groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate
    management facilities and other costs associated with the
    development of the site. We review the adequacy of our cost
    estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with
    third-party bids or contractual arrangements, reviewing the
    changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness, and
    comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior
    period costs. These development costs, together with any costs
    incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill, including
    capitalized interest, are recorded to the landfill asset on the
    balance sheet as incurred.

Residual risk:

§

Actual future costs of construction materials and third-party
    labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of
    the impact from general economic conditions on the availability
    of the required materials and labor. Technical designs could be
    altered due to unexpected operating conditions, regulatory
    changes or legislative changes.

Landfill development asset amortization.

In order to
    match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue
    generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill
    development asset over its operating life on a per-ton basis as
    waste is accepted at the landfill. The landfill asset is fully
    amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life. The
    per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill
    development asset net book value plus estimated future
    development costs (as described above) for the landfill by the
    landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity. The
    expected future development costs are not inflated or
    discounted, but rather expressed in nominal dollars. This rate
    is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at
    amortization expense for the period.

Amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of
    the landfill, including acquisition costs, which in turn is
    determined by geographic location and market values. We secure
    significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and
    value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value.
    Amortization rates are also influenced by site-specific
    engineering and cost factors.



Residual risk:

§

Changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal
    capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization
    rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively. An
    unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction
    in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability
    of the landfill and result in an asset impairment.

On at least an annual basis, we update the estimates of future
    development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each
    landfill. These costs and disposal capacity estimates are
    reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually.
    Changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected
    prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are
    updated annually.

Landfill Asset
    Retirement Obligations

We have two types of retirement obligations related to
    landfills: (1) capping and (2) closure and
    post-closure.

We account for our final capping, closure and post-closure
    activities in accordance with SFAS 143. Under
    SFAS 143, obligations associated with final capping
    activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill
    are recognized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping
    event. Obligations related to closure and post-closure
    activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations
    are recognized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the
    landfill. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the
    related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the

units-of-consumption

method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or
    the airspace consumed within the entire landfill, depending on
    the nature of the obligation. All obligations are initially
    measured at estimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a
    present value basis using an inflation rate and our
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect at the time the
    liabilities were incurred. Future costs for final capping,
    closure and post-closure are developed at least annually by
    engineers, and are inflated to future value using estimated
    future payment dates and inflation rate projections.

Landfill capping.

As individual areas within each
    landfill reach capacity, we are required to cap and close the
    areas in accordance with the landfill site permit. These
    requirements are detailed in the technical design of the
    landfill siting process described above.

Closure and post-closure.

Closure costs are costs
    incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste, but prior
    to being certified as closed. After the entire landfill site has
    reached capacity and is certified closed, we are required to
    maintain and monitor the site for a post-closure period, which
    generally extends for 30 years. Costs associated with
    closure and post-closure requirements generally include
    maintenance of the site and the monitoring of methane gas
    collection systems and groundwater systems, and other activities
    that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste. Costs
    associated with post-closure monitoring generally include
    groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports,
    third-party labor associated with gas system operations and
    maintenance, transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion
    control costs related to the final cap.

Landfill retirement obligation liabilities and
    assets.

Estimates of the total future costs required to
    cap, close and monitor the landfill as specified by each
    landfill permit are updated annually. The estimates include
    inflation, the specific timing of future cash outflows, and the
    anticipated waste flow into the capping events. Our cost
    estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an
    estimate of inflation, which is updated annually (2.5% in both
    2008 and 2007).

The present value of the remaining capping costs for specific
    capping events and the remaining closure and post-closure costs
    for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a per-ton basis.
    These liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed
    at the landfill.

Capping, closure and post-closure liabilities are recorded in
    layers and discounted using our credit-adjusted risk-free rate
    in effect at the time the obligation is incurred (6.6% in 2008
    and 6.5% in 2007).



Retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the
    passage of time by accreting the balance at the same
    credit-adjusted risk-free rate that was used to calculate each
    layer of the recorded liabilities. This accretion expense is
    charged to operating expenses. Actual cash expenditures reduce
    the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made.

Corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the
    same value as the additions to the capping, closure and
    post-closure liabilities. The retirement obligation assets are
    amortized to expense on a per-ton basis as disposal capacity is
    consumed. The per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of
    each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book
    value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation
    asset by the remaining disposal capacity. A per-ton rate is
    determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal
    capacity relating to that event. Closure and post-closure
    per-ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the
    landfill.

Residual risks:

§

Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including
    changes in capping, closure activities or post-closure
    monitoring activities, types and quantities of materials used,
    or term of post-closure care could cause changes in our cost
    estimates.

§

Changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in
    the anticipated waste flow, cost change in airspace compaction
    estimates or the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and
    fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results
    of operations prospectively. This could result in unanticipated
    increases or decreases in expense.

§

Actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from
    projected timing, causing differences in timing of when
    amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping,
    closure and post-closure liabilities.

§

Changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs
    and our total liabilities.

§

Changes in our capital structure or market conditions could
    result in changes to the credit-adjusted risk-free rate used to
    discount the liabilities, which could cause changes in future
    recorded liabilities, assets and expense.

§

Amortization rates could change in the future based on the
    evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill
    capping design, post-closure monitoring requirements, or the
    inflation or discount rate.

On an annual basis, we update our estimates of future capping,
    closure and post-closure costs and of future disposal capacity
    for each landfill. Revisions in estimates of our costs or timing
    of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or
    decreases to the capping, closure and post-closure liabilities
    and the corresponding retirement obligation assets. Changes in
    the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are
    applied prospectively, except for fully incurred capping events
    and closed landfills, where the changes are recorded immediately
    in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity
    has already been consumed.

In connection with the 2008 annual review of our calculations
    with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations, we made a
    change in estimate, which is considered to be a change in
    accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting
    principle as defined by SFAS 154,

Accounting Changes and
    Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB
    Statement No. 3

(SFAS 154). This change, which we
    believe is preferable, was made to better align the estimated
    amount of waste placed in an area to be capped (which is used to
    calculate our capping rates) with the physical operation of our
    landfills. The expected costs related to our capping events did
    not change and we will continue to use separate rates for each
    capping event. This change resulted in a $32.6 million decrease
    in our capping asset retirement obligations and related assets.
    These assets will be amortized to expense prospectively as a
    change in estimate, in accordance with SFAS 154. This
    change in estimate will not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.



Permitted and probable disposal capacity.

As
    described previously, disposal capacity is determined by the
    specifications detailed in the landfill permit. We classify this
    disposal capacity as permitted. We also include probable
    expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity
    estimates, thus including additional disposal capacity being
    sought through means of a permit expansion. Probable expansion
    disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the
    applicable regulatory agencies, but we have determined that
    certain critical criteria have been met and the successful
    completion of the expansion is probable. We have developed six
    criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated
    as probable expansion airspace. We believe that satisfying all
    of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion
    airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be
    permitted. However, because some of these criteria are
    judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will
    eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will
    not be permitted. In either of these scenarios, our
    amortization, depletion and accretion expense could change
    significantly. Our internal criteria to classify disposal
    capacity as probable expansion are as follows:

§

We own or control the land associated with the expansion
    airspace pursuant to an option agreement;

§

We are committed to supporting the expansion project financially
    and with appropriate resources;

§

There are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated
    with the project, including political impediments;

§

Progress is being made on the project;

§

The expansion is attainable within a reasonable time
    frame; and

§

We believe it is likely the expansion permit will be received.

After successfully meeting these criteria, the disposal capacity
    that will result from the planned expansion is included in our
    remaining disposal capacity estimates. Additionally, for
    purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping,
    closure and post-closure rates, we include the incremental costs
    to develop, construct, close and monitor the related probable
    expansion disposal capacity.

Residual risk:

§

We may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable
    expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the
    final local, state or federal permits or due to other unknown
    reasons. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for
    probable expansion disposal capacity, or the disposal capacity
    for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated,
    both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be
    reduced, which generally increases the rates we charge for
    landfill amortization and capping, closure and post-closure
    accruals. An unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also
    cause an asset impairment.

Environmental
    Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to
    the protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation
    at sites that we either own or operate, including sites that we
    have acquired, or sites where we have (or a company that we have
    acquired has) delivered waste. Our environmental remediation
    liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating
    groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as
    controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related
    legal costs. To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites,
    we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of
    contamination at each identified site, the required remediation
    methods, the apportionment of responsibility among the
    potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of
    those parties. We accrue for costs associated with environmental
    remediation obligations when such costs are probable and
    reasonably estimable. We periodically review the status of all
    environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood
    of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary. Changes
    in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are



recorded to operating income in the period in which the change
    in estimate is made. Adjustments to estimates are reasonably
    possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded
    amounts.

The majority of our environmental remediation liabilities were
    acquired as part of our acquisition of Allied. We have accounted
    for the environmental remediation liabilities we acquired from
    Allied based on estimates of their fair values, and we have
    discounted these liabilities in accordance with SFAS 141.
    Prior to our acquisition of Allied, Allied’s environmental
    remediation liabilities were accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

(SFAS 5), and American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants Statement of Position

96-1,

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

(SOP 96-1),

which require that estimated losses be recorded for loss
    contingencies if, prior to the issuance of the financial
    statements, it is probable that liabilities have been incurred
    and the amounts of the losses can be reasonably estimated. If it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred, but no estimate
    of the liability is more likely than any other, a liability is
    recorded at the lower end of the range. However, amounts
    recorded under this guidance are generally not considered fair
    value.

Our process for determining the fair value for the environmental
    liabilities we acquired includes first identifying the
    population of sites that we either are or have indications that
    we may be responsible for the costs of remediation. These sites
    are then assessed to determine the risks that they are, or may
    be subject to, that would significantly affect either the cost
    or timing of remediation activities. We use these risk scenarios
    to develop estimates of future cash flows based on the risks
    identified. Generally speaking, sites with a higher risk of
    significant variability in future cash flows or timing of those
    cash flows have more risk scenarios identified than sites which
    we deem to be at a lower risk. We then probability-weight these
    risk scenarios and discount these liabilities to present value
    to determine their fair values. Although we have prepared and
    recorded a preliminary valuation of the environmental
    liabilities we acquired from Allied, we do not expect to
    complete our valuation of these liabilities until 2009. After we
    have finalized this valuation, future changes in these estimates
    will be recorded in accordance with SFAS 5 and

SOP 96-1.

Significant adjustments to these reserves may occur in the
    future.

Our other environmental liabilities are accounted for in
    accordance with SFAS 5 and

SOP 96-1.

The recorded liabilities represent our estimate of the most
    likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined
    liability is probable. These estimates do not take into account
    discounts to present value the total estimated costs. We
    reevaluate these matters as additional information becomes
    available to ascertain whether the liabilities we have accrued
    are adequate. We have not reduced the liabilities we have
    recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible
    parties or insurance companies.

Residual risks:

§

We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our
    environmental remediation liabilities. Our estimates of these
    liabilities require assumptions about future events that are
    uncertain. Consequently, our estimates could change
    substantially as additional information becomes available
    regarding the nature or extent of contamination, the required
    remediation methods, the final apportionment of responsibility
    among the potentially responsible parties identified, the
    financial viability of those parties, and the actions of
    governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the
    matter.

§

Actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a
    result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue
    the matter to ultimate resolution.

§

An unanticipated environmental liability that arises could
    result in a material charge to our consolidated statement of
    income.

Self-Insurance
    Reserves and Related Costs

Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. Accruals for
    self-insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates
    of claims incurred but not reported. We maintain high
    deductibles for commercial



general liability, automobile liability and workers’
    compensation coverages, ranging from $1.0 million to
    $3.0 million.

Residual risks:

§

Incident rates, including frequency and severity, and other
    actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and
    future actuarially determined obligations to change, which would
    be adjusted to our consolidated statement of income in the
    period in which such adjustment is known.

§

It is possible that recorded reserves may not be adequate to
    cover the future payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to
    estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments will
    be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the
    periods in which such adjustments are known.

§

The settlement costs to discharge our obligations, including
    legal and health care costs, could increase or decrease causing
    current estimates of our self-insurance reserves to change.

Loss
    Contingencies

We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and
    regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to
    significant uncertainty. Consistent with SFAS 5, we
    determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies
    based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote,
    reasonably possible or probable, and whether it can be
    reasonably estimated. We analyze our litigation and regulatory
    matters based on available information to assess the potential
    liabilities. Management’s assessment is developed based on
    an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. We
    accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and
    reasonably estimable. If a contingent liability is only
    reasonably possible, we will disclose the potential range of the
    loss, if estimable.

We record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations
    or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on
    the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss
    contingency.

Residual risks:

§

Actual costs can vary from our estimates for a variety of
    reasons including differing interpretations of laws, opinions on
    culpability and assessments of the amount of damages.

§

Loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are
    inherently subjective and generally involve business matters
    that are by their nature unpredictable. If a loss contingency
    results in an adverse judgment or is settled for significant
    amounts, it could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, result of operations or cash
    flows in the period in which such judgment or settlement occurs.

Asset
    Impairment

Valuation methodology.

We evaluate our long-lived
    assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset
    group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows
    anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those
    assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets.

Residual risk:

§

If events or changes in circumstances occur, including
    reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations
    or determinations to divest assets, certain assets could be
    impaired which would result in a non-cash charge to earnings.

Evaluation criteria.

We test long-lived assets for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.
    Examples of such events could include a significant adverse
    change in the extent or manner in which we use a long-lived
    asset, a change in its physical condition, or new circumstances
    that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not



that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long-lived asset
    significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
    life.

Residual risk:

§

Our most significant asset impairment exposure, other than
    goodwill (which is discussed below) relates to our landfills. A
    significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a
    result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments,
    revocation of an existing permit or denial of an expansion
    permit, or changes in our assumptions used to calculate disposal
    capacity could trigger an impairment charge.

Recognition criteria.

If such circumstances arise,
    we recognize an impairment for the difference between the
    carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book
    value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted
    cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual
    disposition. We generally use the present value of the expected
    cash flows from that asset to determine fair value.

Goodwill
    Recoverability

Valuation methodology.

We evaluate goodwill for
    impairment based on the estimated fair value of each of our
    reporting units, which we define as our geographic operating
    segments. We estimate fair value based on projected net cash
    flows discounted using our weighted average cost of capital,
    which was approximately 7.0% in 2008.

Residual risk:

§

The estimated fair value of our operating segments could change
    with changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest
    rates, actual capital expenditure levels, ability to perform at
    levels that were forecasted or our market capitalization, or
    other general economic conditions. For example, a reduction in
    long-term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair
    value of the operating segments to below their carrying values,
    which would trigger an impairment charge. Similarly, an increase
    in our weighted average cost of capital could trigger an
    impairment charge.

Evaluation criteria.

We test goodwill for
    recoverability on an annual basis or whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable. For example, a significant adverse change in our
    liquidity or the business environment, unanticipated
    competition, a significant adverse action by a regulator, or the
    disposal of a significant portion of an operating segment could
    prompt an impairment test between annual assessments.

Recognition criteria.

We use a two-step test to
    evaluate goodwill impairment. Under the first step, we compare
    the fair value of each operating segment to its carrying value
    (including goodwill). If the fair value of the operating segment
    is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill
    impairment exists for the operating segment and we perform step
    two of the impairment test.

For purposes of performing the second step, we allocate the fair
    value of each operating segment to all the assets and
    liabilities of the operating segment as if the operating segment
    had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the
    impairment test. We deduct the fair value of tangible net assets
    and other intangible assets from the fair value of each
    operating segment to determine the implied fair value of the
    goodwill for each operating segment. If the implied fair value
    of an operating segment’s goodwill is lower than its
    carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and we write it down to
    its implied fair value. At the time of a divestiture of an
    individual business unit within an operating segment, goodwill
    of the operating segment is allocated to that business unit
    based on the relative fair value of the unit being disposed to
    the total fair value of the operating segment and a gain or loss
    on disposal is determined. Subsequently, the remaining goodwill
    in the operating segment from which the assets were divested is
    re-evaluated for impairment, which could result in an impairment
    charge.



Residual risk:

§

At the time of divestiture of an individual business unit, we
    allocate goodwill to the business unit divested and a gain or
    loss on disposal is calculated. We may incur non-cash losses on
    future sales of business units primarily due to the goodwill
    allocated to the business units divested.

Income
    Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(SFAS 109). Accordingly, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based on differences between the
    financial reporting and income tax bases of assets (other than
    non-deductible goodwill) and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
    and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect
    during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.

We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these
    assets will more likely than not be realized. In making this
    determination, we consider all available positive and negative
    evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax
    liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning
    strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we
    determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income
    tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount,
    we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which
    would reduce the provision for income taxes.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of
    FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

(FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial
    statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 provides that a
    tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized
    when it is more likely than not that the position will be
    sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related
    appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.
    This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement,
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, and
    accounting in interim periods.

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits within the provision for income taxes in our
    consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and
    penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and
    deferred income taxes and other long-term tax liabilities in our
    consolidated balance sheets.

Residual risks:

§

Income tax assets and liabilities established in purchase
    accounting for acquisitions are based on assumptions that could
    differ from the ultimate outcome of the tax matters. Such
    adjustments would be charged or credited to earnings pursuant to
    SFAS 141(R),

Business Combinations

, unless they meet
    certain remeasurement criteria and are allowed to be adjusted to
    goodwill.

§

Changes in the estimated realizability of deferred tax assets
    could result in adjustments to our provision for income taxes.

§

Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the
    realizability of net operating loss carryforwards for tax
    purposes are based on our judgment. If our judgments and
    estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability
    of net operating loss carryforwards are incorrect, our provision
    for income taxes would change.

§

We are currently under examination or administrative review by
    various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax
    years. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and income tax
    regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to
    interpret and apply to our transactions. Positions taken in tax
    years under examination or subsequent years are subject to
    challenge. Accordingly, we may have exposure for additional tax
    liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken by
    us or by companies we have acquired are disallowed by the taxing
    authorities.



§

We recognize tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions in
    accordance with FIN 48, and we adjust these liabilities when our
    judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new
    information not previously available. Due to the complexity of
    some of these uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may
    result in payments that are materially different from our
    current estimates of the tax liabilities. These differences will
    be reflected as increases or decreases to our provision for
    income taxes in the period in which they are determined.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans

We currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan,
    the BFI Retirement Plan (the Plan), as a result of our
    acquisition of Allied in December 2008. The Plan covers certain
    employees in the United States, including some employees subject
    to collective bargaining agreements. The Plan’s benefit
    formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in
    the Plan document. The benefits of approximately 97% of the
    current plan participants were frozen upon Allied’s
    acquisition of BFI in 1999.

Our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding
    standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security
    Act of 1974 and IRC, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of
    2006. No contributions were required during the last three years
    and no contributions are anticipated for 2009.

The Plan’s assets are invested as determined by our
    Retirement Benefits Committee. At December 31, 2008, the
    plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds, equity
    funds and cash. We annually review and adjust the plan’s
    asset allocation as deemed necessary.

Residual risk:

§

Changes in the plan’s investment mix and performance of the
    equity and bond markets and fund managers could impact the
    amount of pension income or expense recorded, the funded status
    of the plan and the need for future cash contributions.

Assumptions.

The benefit obligation and associated
    income or expense related to the Plan are determined based on
    assumptions concerning items such as discount rates, expected
    rates of return and average rates of compensation increases. Our
    assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed
    necessary.

We determine the discount rate based on a model which matches
    the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities
    of high quality bonds priced as of the Plan measurement date.
    Where that timing does not correspond to a published
    high-quality bond rate, our model uses an expected yield curve
    to determine an appropriate current discount rate. The yield on
    the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability.
    If the discount rate increases by 1%, our benefit obligation
    would decrease by approximately $34.0 million. If the
    discount rate were to decrease by 1%, our benefit obligation
    would increase by approximately $39.0 million.

In developing our expected rate of return assumption, we
    evaluate long-term expected and historical returns on the Plan
    assets, giving consideration to our asset mix and the
    anticipated duration of the Plan obligations. The average rate
    of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average
    pay increases over the periods benefits are earned. Less than 3%
    of participants in the Plan continue to earn service benefits.

Residual risks:

§

Our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in
    market-based interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate
    will increase our related benefit plan obligation.

§

Our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual
    return on plan assets were to vary from the expected return.

The table below provides information about certain of our

    exposure is changing interest rates in the United States and
    fluctuations in LIBOR. We intend to manage interest rate risk

The fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying
    value, since interest rates are variable and, thus, approximate
    current market rates.

Fuel Price
    Risk

Fuel costs represent a significant operating
    expense.

When economically practical, we may
    enter into new or renewal contracts, or engage in other
    strategies to mitigate market risk. Where appropriate, we have
    implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our
    fuel costs. While we charge these fees to a majority of our
    customers, we are unable to charge such fees to all customers.
    Consequently, an increase in fuel costs results in (1) an
    increase in our cost of operations, (2) a smaller increase
    in our revenue (from the fuel recovery fee) and (3) a
    decrease in our operating margin percentage, since the increase
    in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost.
    Conversely, a decrease in fuel costs results in (1) a
    decrease in our cost of operations, (2) a smaller decrease
    in our revenue and (3) an increase in our operating margin
    percentage.

At our current consumption levels, a one-cent change in the
    price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately
    $1.7 million on an annual basis, which would be partially
    offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to
    our customers. Accordingly, a substantial rise or drop in fuel
    costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost
    of operations.

Our operations also require the use of certain petroleum-based
    products (such as liners at our landfills) whose costs may vary
    with the price of oil. An increase in the price of oil could
    increase the cost of those products, which would increase our
    operating and capital costs. We are also susceptible to
    increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors.

Commodities
    Prices

We market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from
    our material recycling facilities. As a result, changes in the
    market prices of these items will impact our results of
    operations. Revenue from sales of recycled cardboard and
    newspaper in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were approximately
    $121.1 million, $113.9 million and $80.1 million,
    respectively.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Republic Services,
    Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Republic Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Republic Services, Inc. and subsidiaries
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
    in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Republic Services, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated March 2, 2009
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Republic Services,
    Inc.:

We have audited Republic Services, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Republic Services,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of
    Management on Republic Services, Inc.’s Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Report of Management on
    Republic Services, Inc.’s  Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting, management’s  assessment of and conclusion on
    the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    did not include the internal controls of Allied Waste
    Industries, Inc., which is  included in the 2008 consolidated
    financial statements of Republic Services, Inc. and constituted
    $15,460.7 million and $(14.9) million of total and net
    assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and
    $463.7 million and $(11.3) million of revenue and net
    income, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of
    internal control over financial reporting of Republic Services,
    Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control
    over financial reporting of Allied Waste Industries, Inc.

In our opinion, Republic Services, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO
    criteria.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Republic Services, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
    equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 of
    Republic Services, Inc. and our report dated March 2, 2009
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION

Republic Services, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and its
    subsidiaries (also referred to collectively as Republic, we, us,
    our, or the company in this report) is the second largest
    provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer,
    recycling and disposal services in the United States, as
    measured by revenue. We manage and evaluate our operations
    through four geographic regions — Eastern, Central,
    Southern, and Western, which we have identified as our
    reportable segments. In addition, we acquired Allied Waste
    Industries, Inc. (Allied) in December 2008, and, due to the
    timing of that acquisition, we have presented Allied as a
    separate reportable segment in our consolidated financial
    statements. Also, since we acquired Allied effective
    December 5, 2008, we should include all of the operating
    results of Allied starting on that date in our consolidated
    financial statements. For accounting convenience, the
    consolidated financial statements include the operating results
    of Allied from December 1, 2008 (the date of the accounting
    close), adjusted for all material transactions that occurred
    from December 1 through December 4, 2008.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Republic, its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries, and
    certain variable interest entities for which we have determined
    that we are the primary beneficiary in accordance with Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities — an
    interpretation of ARB No. 51

(revised December 2003).
    We account for investments in entities in which we do not have a
    controlling financial interest under either the equity method or
    cost method of accounting, as appropriate. Our investments in
    variable interest entities are not material to our consolidated
    financial statements. All material intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a

3-for-2

stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effective on
    March 16, 2007, to stockholders of record as of
    March 5, 2007. Our shares, per share amounts, and weighted
    average common and common equivalent shares have been
    retroactively adjusted for all periods to reflect the stock
    split.

Merger with
    Allied Waste Industries, Inc.

On June 22, 2008, Republic entered into an Agreement and
    Plan of Merger with Allied. Prior to the merger, Allied was the
    second largest provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection,
    transfer, recycling and disposal services in the United States,
    as measured by revenue. The completion of the merger was subject
    to certain terms and conditions, including, but not limited to,
    approval of the transaction by the stockholders of both Republic
    and Allied, regulatory approval from the Department of Justice
    (DOJ), and receipt of credit ratings for the combined company
    classifying our senior debt as investment grade. Having met
    those terms and conditions on December 5, 2008, we
    completed the merger.

As of the effective date of the merger, each share of Allied
    common stock outstanding was converted into .45 shares of
    our common stock. We issued approximately 195.8 million
    shares of common stock to Allied stockholders in the merger.
    Allied stockholders received approximately 52% of the
    outstanding common stock of the combined company in respect of
    their Allied shares on a diluted basis as a result of the
    merger, and Republic stockholders retained approximately 48% of
    the outstanding common stock of the combined company on a
    diluted basis. The total purchase price paid for Allied,
    including the value of common stock issued, our acquisition of
    Allied’s debt and other costs, totaled approximately
    $11.5 billion.

Republic has been determined to be the acquiring company for
    accounting purposes in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141,

Business
    Combinations

(SFAS 141). Therefore, we have accounted
    for the merger as an acquisition of Allied by Republic, using
    the purchase method of accounting in accordance with United
    States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    operating results of Allied from the date of the acquisition,
    and have not been retroactively restated to include
    Allied’s historical financial position,

results of operations or cash flows. In accordance with the
    purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid has been
    allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon
    their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the
    merger, with the excess of the purchase price over the net
    assets acquired being recorded as goodwill. We are in the
    process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in
    the merger, and, until we have completed our valuation process,
    there may be adjustments to our estimates of fair values and the
    resulting preliminary purchase price allocation. See
    Note 3,

Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,

for
    additional information.

For comparative purposes, certain prior year amounts have been
    reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

SUMMARY OF
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Management’s
    Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
    estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and
    recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities,
    stockholders’ equity, revenue and expenses. We must make
    these estimates and assumptions because certain information that
    we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with
    a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot
    be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies.
    In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to
    determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In
    preparing our financial statements, the most difficult,
    subjective and complex estimates and assumptions that deal with
    the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for
    our long-lived assets, landfill development costs, and final
    capping, closure and post-closure costs, our valuation
    allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets, our
    liabilities for potential litigation, claims and assessments,
    our liabilities for environmental remediation, employee benefit
    plans, deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions and
    self-insurance, and our estimates of the fair values of the
    assets and liabilities acquired in our acquisition of Allied.
    Each of these items is discussed in more detail below. Our
    actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

We consider liquid investments with an original maturity of
    three months or less to be cash equivalents.

We may have net book credit balances in our primary disbursement
    accounts at the end of a reporting period. We classify such
    credit balances as accounts payable in our consolidated balance
    sheets as checks presented for payment to these accounts are not
    payable by our banks under overdraft arrangements, and, as such
    do not represent short-term borrowings. As of December 31,
    2008, there were no net book credit balances in our primary
    disbursement accounts.

Concentration of
    Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash
    equivalents, trade accounts receivable and derivative
    instruments. We place our cash and cash equivalents with high
    quality financial institutions. Such balances may be in excess
    of FDIC insured limits. In order to manage the related credit
    exposure, we continually monitor the credit worthiness of the
    financial institutions where we have deposits. Concentrations of
    credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are
    limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in
    which we provide services, as well as the dispersion of our
    operations across many geographic areas. We provide services to
    commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers in
    the United States and Puerto Rico. We perform ongoing credit
    evaluations of our customers, but do not require collateral to
    support customer receivables. We establish an allowance for
    doubtful accounts based on various factors including the credit



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

risk of specific customers, age of receivables outstanding,
    historical trends, economic conditions and other information.

Accounts
    Receivable, Net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable represent receivables from customers for
    collection, transfer, recycling, disposal and other services.
    Our receivables are recorded when billed or the related revenue
    is earned, if earlier, and represent claims against third
    parties that will be settled in cash. The carrying value of our
    receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts,
    represents their estimated net realizable value. Provisions for
    doubtful accounts are evaluated on a monthly basis and are
    recorded based on our historical collection experience, the age
    of the receivables, specific customer information and economic
    conditions. We also review outstanding balances on an
    account-specific basis. In general, reserves are provided for
    accounts receivable in excess of ninety days old. Past due
    receivable balances are written-off when our collection efforts
    have been unsuccessful in collecting amounts due.

In 2007, we recorded a $4.3 million reduction in our
    allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of refining our
    estimate of the allowance based on our historical collection
    experience. In November 2008, prior to our acquisition of
    Allied, Allied recorded a $4.5 million increase in its
    allowance for doubtful accounts primarily related to the filing
    for bankruptcy of a major customer and management’s
    assessment of the collectibility of other national accounts
    receivable. Subsequent to our acquisition of Allied, we recorded
    a provision for doubtful accounts of $14.2 million to
    adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts
    receivable acquired from Allied to conform to Republic’s
    accounting policies. We also recorded $5.4 million to
    provide for specific bankruptcy exposures in 2008. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, our allowance for doubtful
    accounts was $65.7 million and $14.7 million,
    respectively.

Restricted
    Cash

As of December 31, 2008, we had $281.9 million of
    restricted cash, of which $133.5 million was proceeds from
    the issuance of tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings
    and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of
    the agreements. Restricted cash also includes amounts held in
    trust as a guarantee of performance.

We obtain funds through the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for the
    purpose of financing qualifying expenditures at our landfills,
    transfer stations, and collection and recycling facilities. The
    funds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding
    authorities at the time of issuance. As we do not have the
    ability to use these funds for general operating purposes, they
    are classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance
    sheets.

In the normal course of business, we may be required to provide
    financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of
    other entities in connection with municipal residential
    collection contracts, the operation, closure or post-closure of
    landfills, environmental remediation, environmental permits, and
    business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our
    performance. At several of our landfills, we satisfy financial
    assurance requirements by depositing cash into restricted trust
    funds or escrow accounts.

Property and
    Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for
    major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized,
    while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
    incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the
    related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
    accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the
    consolidated statements of income.

We revise the estimated useful lives of property and equipment
    acquired through business acquisitions to conform with our
    policies regarding property and equipment. Depreciation is
    provided over the estimated



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

useful lives of the assets involved using the straight-line
    method. We assume no salvage value for our depreciable property
    and equipment. The estimated useful lives are seven to forty
    years for buildings and improvements, five to twelve years for
    vehicles, seven to ten years for most landfill equipment, three
    to fifteen years for all other equipment, and five to twelve
    years for furniture and fixtures.

Landfill development costs are also included in property and
    equipment. Landfill development costs include direct costs
    incurred to obtain landfill permits and direct costs incurred to
    acquire, construct and develop sites as well as final capping,
    closure and post-closure assets accrued in accordance with
    SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations

(SFAS 143). These costs are amortized or
    depleted based on consumed airspace. All indirect landfill
    development costs are expensed as incurred. (For additional
    information, see

Landfill and Environmental Costs

below.)

Capitalized
    Interest

We capitalize interest on landfill cell construction and other
    construction projects in accordance with SFAS No. 34,

Capitalization of Interest Cost

. Construction projects
    must meet the following criteria before interest is capitalized:

1.

Total construction costs are $50,000 or greater,

2.

The construction phase is one month or longer, and

3.

The assets have a useful life of one year or longer.

Interest is capitalized on qualified assets while they undergo
    activities to ready them for their intended use. Capitalization
    of interest ceases once an asset is placed into service or if
    construction activity is suspended for more than a brief period
    of time. Our interest capitalization rate is based on our
    weighted average cost of indebtedness. Interest capitalized was
    $2.6 million, $3.0 million and $2.7 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments to manage our risk
    associated with changing interest rates and changing prices for
    commodities we frequently purchase or sell by creating
    offsetting market exposures. We use interest rate swap
    agreements to manage risk associated with fluctuations in
    interest rates. We have entered into multiple agreements
    designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate some of our exposure
    to changes in diesel fuel prices and prices of certain
    commodities.

We account for our derivative financial instruments in
    accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(SFAS 133). SFAS 133 requires us to measure all
    derivatives at fair value and to recognize them in the balance
    sheet as assets or liabilities, as appropriate. For derivatives
    designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the
    effective portions of derivative instruments are reported in
    stockholders’ equity as components of other comprehensive
    income until the forecasted transaction occurs or they are
    terminated. When the forecasted transaction occurs or they are
    terminated, the realized net gain or loss is then recognized in
    the consolidated statements of income. Changes in fair value of
    the ineffective portions of the derivative instruments are
    recognized in earnings immediately.

The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements and the
    fair values of our diesel fuel and other commodity hedges are
    obtained from third-party counter-parties and are determined
    using standard valuation models with assumptions about prices
    and other relevant information based on those observed in the
    underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy
    under SFAS 157). The estimated fair values of derivatives
    used to hedge risks fluctuate over time and should be viewed in
    relation to the underlying hedged transactions.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of
    the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. A substantial
    portion of our goodwill was recorded as part of the preliminary
    purchase price allocation for our acquisition of Allied in
    December 2008.

Goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis.
    In accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

, goodwill and other indefinite-lived
    intangibles are no longer amortized but instead are reviewed for
    impairment using a two-step process. In testing for impairment,
    we first estimate the fair value of each operating segment and
    compare the fair value with the carrying value. If the fair
    value of an operating segment is greater than its carrying
    value, then no impairment results. If the fair value is less
    than its carrying value, then we would determine the implied
    fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is
    determined by deducting the fair value of an operating
    segment’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair
    value of the operating segment as a whole, as if that operating
    segment had just been acquired and the purchase price were being
    initially allocated. If the implied fair value of goodwill were
    less than the carrying value of the goodwill for an operating
    segment, an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in
    our consolidated statement of income.

In addition, we would evaluate an operating segment for
    impairment if events or circumstances were to change between
    annual tests indicating a possible impairment. Examples of such
    events or circumstances include the following:

§

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
    climate,

§

An adverse action or assessment by a regulator,

§

A more likely than not expectation that a segment or a
    significant portion thereof will be sold, or

§

The testing for recoverability under SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

(SFAS 144), of a significant asset group within the
    segment.

We incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual
    goodwill impairment tests in 2008, 2007 and 2006. However, there
    can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any
    time in the future. The estimated fair value of our operating
    segments could change if there are changes in our capital
    structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure
    levels, operating cash flows or market capitalization, or in
    general economic conditions.

Our operating segments, which also represent our reporting
    units, are comprised of several vertically integrated
    businesses. When an individual business within an operating
    segment is divested, goodwill is allocated to that business
    based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its
    operating segment in determining the gain or loss to be recorded
    on the divestiture.

Other intangible assets includes values assigned to customer
    relationships, long-term contracts, covenants not to compete and
    tradenames, and are amortized generally on a straight-line basis
    over periods ranging from 2 to 10 years.

Landfill and
    Environmental Costs

Life Cycle
    Accounting

We use life-cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the
    site. In life cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and
    construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based
    on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace.

Costs and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers. We use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to
    expense capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily
    relate to



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

changes in available airspace, inflation and applicable
    regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes due
    to the addition of airspace lying in probable expansion areas.

Total
    Available Disposal Capacity

As of December 31, 2008, we owned or operated 213 active
    solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity of
    approximately 4.9 billion in-place cubic yards. Total
    available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated
    permitted airspace plus our estimate of expansion airspace that
    has a probable likelihood of being permitted.

Probable
    Expansion Airspace

We classify landfill disposal capacity as either permitted
    (having received the final permit from the applicable regulatory
    agency) or as probable expansion airspace. Before airspace
    included in an expansion area is determined to be probable
    expansion airspace and, therefore, is included in our
    calculation of total available disposal capacity, the following
    criteria must be met:

1.

We own or control the land associated with the expansion
    airspace pursuant to an option agreement,

2.

We are committed to supporting the expansion project financially
    and with appropriate resources,

3.

There are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated
    with the project, including political impediments,

4.

Progress is being made on the project,

5.

The expansion is attainable within a reasonable time
    frame, and

6.

We believe it is likely the expansion permit will be received.

Upon meeting our expansion criteria, the rates used at each
    applicable landfill to expense costs to acquire, construct, cap,
    close and maintain a site during the post-closure period are
    adjusted to include both the probable expansion airspace and the
    additional costs to be capitalized or accrued associated with
    that expansion airspace.

We have identified three steps that landfills generally follow
    to obtain expansion permits. These steps are as follows:

1.

Obtaining approval from local authorities,

2.

Submitting a permit application to state authorities and

3.

Obtaining permit approval from state authorities.

We continually monitor our progress toward obtaining permits for
    each of our sites with probable airspace. If at any point it is
    determined that a landfill expansion area no longer meets our
    criteria, the probable expansion airspace is removed from the
    landfill’s total available capacity and the rates used at
    the landfill to expense costs to acquire, construct, cap, close
    and maintain a site during the post-closure period are adjusted
    accordingly. In addition, any amounts capitalized for the
    probable expansion airspace are charged to expense in the period
    in which it is determined that the criteria are no longer met.

Capitalized
    Landfill Costs

Capitalized landfill costs include expenditures for land,
    permitting, cell construction and environmental structures.
    Capitalized permitting and cell construction costs are limited
    to direct costs relating to these activities, including legal,
    engineering and construction costs associated with excavation,
    natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate
    collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells
    and other costs associated with the development of the site.
    Interest is capitalized on landfill construction projects while
    the assets are undergoing activities to ready them for their
    intended use. Capitalized landfill costs also include final
    capping, closure and post-closure assets accrued in accordance
    with SFAS 143 as discussed below.

Costs related to acquiring land, excluding the estimated
    residual value of unpermitted, non-buffer land, and costs
    related to permitting and cell construction are depleted as
    airspace is consumed using the

units-of-consumption

method.

Capitalized landfill costs may also include an allocation of
    purchase price paid for landfills. For landfills purchased as
    part of a group of assets, the purchase price assigned to the
    landfill is determined based on the estimated fair value of the
    landfill relative to the fair value of other assets within the
    acquired group. If the landfill meets our expansion criteria,
    the purchase price is further allocated between permitted
    airspace and expansion airspace based on the ratio of permitted
    versus probable expansion airspace to total available airspace.
    Landfill purchase price is amortized using the

units-of-consumption

method over the total available airspace including probable
    expansion airspace where appropriate.

Final Capping,
    Closure and Post-Closure Costs

We account for final capping, closure and post-closure in
    accordance with SFAS 143.

We have future obligations for final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs with respect to the landfills we own or
    operate as set forth in applicable landfill permits. Final
    capping, closure and post-closure costs include estimated costs
    to be incurred for final capping and closure of landfills and
    estimated costs for providing required post-closure monitoring
    and maintenance of landfills. The permit requirements are based
    on the Subtitle C and Subtitle D regulations of the Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act, as implemented and applied on a

state-by-state

basis. Obligations associated with monitoring and controlling
    methane gas migration and emissions are set forth in applicable
    landfill permits and these requirements are based on the
    provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended. Final
    capping typically includes installing flexible membrane and
    geosynthetic clay liners, drainage and compact soil layers, and
    topsoil, and is constructed over an area of the landfill where
    total airspace capacity has been consumed and waste disposal
    operations have ceased. These final capping activities occur as
    needed throughout the operating life of a landfill. Other
    closure activities and post-closure activities occur after the
    entire landfill ceases to accept waste and closes. These
    activities involve methane gas control, leachate management and
    groundwater monitoring, surface water monitoring and control,
    and other operational and maintenance activities that occur
    after the site ceases to accept waste. The post-closure period
    generally runs for up to 30 years after final site closure
    for municipal solid waste landfills and a shorter period for
    construction and demolition landfills and inert landfills.

Estimates of future expenditures for final capping, closure and
    post-closure are developed at least annually by engineers. These
    estimates are reviewed by management and are used by our
    operating and accounting personnel to adjust the rates used to
    capitalize and amortize these costs. These estimates involve
    projections of costs that will be incurred during the remaining
    life of the landfill for final capping activities, after the
    landfill ceases operations and during the legally required
    post-closure monitoring period. Additionally, we currently
    retain post-closure responsibility for 126 closed landfills.

Under SFAS 143, a liability for an asset retirement
    obligation must be recognized in the period in which it is
    incurred and should be initially measured at fair value. Absent
    quoted market prices, the estimate of fair value should be based
    on the best available information, including the results of
    present value techniques in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Concepts No. 7,

Using Cash Flow and
    Present Value in Accounting Measurements

(SFAC 7). The
    offset to the liability must be capitalized as part of the
    carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Changes in the
    liabilities due to the passage of time are



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

recognized as operating expenses in the consolidated statement
    of income and are referred to as accretion expense. Changes in
    the liabilities due to revisions to estimated future cash flows
    are recognized by increasing or decreasing the liabilities with
    the offsets adjusting the carrying amounts of the related
    long-lived assets, and may also require immediate adjustments to
    amortization expense in the consolidated statement of income.

Landfill asset retirement obligations include estimates of all
    costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure. Costs
    associated with daily maintenance activities during the
    operating life of the landfill, such as leachate disposal,
    groundwater and gas monitoring, and other pollution control
    activities, are charged to expense as incurred. In addition,
    costs historically accounted for as capital expenditures during
    the operating life of a landfill, such as cell development
    costs, are capitalized when incurred, and charged to expense
    using life cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method based on the consumption of cubic yards of available
    airspace.

We define final capping as activities required to permanently
    cover a portion of a landfill that has been completely filled
    with waste. Final capping occurs in phases as needed throughout
    the operating life of a landfill as specific areas are filled to
    capacity and the final elevation for that specific area is
    reached in accordance with the provisions of the operating
    permit. We consider final capping events to be discrete
    activities that are recognized as asset retirement obligations
    separately from other closure and post-closure obligations.
    These capping events generally occur during the operating life
    of a landfill and can be associated with waste placed in an area
    to be capped. As a result, we use a separate rate per ton for
    recognizing the principal amount of the liability and related
    asset associated with each capping event. We amortize the asset
    recorded pursuant to this approach as waste volume related to
    the capacity covered by the capping event is placed into the
    landfill based on the consumption of cubic yards of available
    airspace.

In connection with the 2008 annual review of our calculations
    with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations, we made a
    change in estimate, which is considered to be a change in
    accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting
    principle as defined by SFAS 154,

Accounting Changes and
    Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB
    Statement No. 3

(SFAS 154). This change, which we
    believe is preferable, was made to better align the estimated
    amount of waste to be placed in an area to be capped (which is
    used to calculate our capping rates) with the physical operation
    of our landfills. The expected costs related to our capping
    events did not change and we will continue to use separate rates
    for each capping event. This change resulted in a
    $32.6 million decrease in our capping asset retirement
    obligations and related assets. These assets will be amortized
    to expense prospectively as a change in estimate, in accordance
    with SFAS 154. This change in estimate will not have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

We recognize asset retirement obligations and the related
    amortization expense for closure and post-closure (excluding
    obligations for final capping) using the

units-of-consumption

method over the total remaining capacity of the landfill. The
    total remaining capacity includes probable expansion airspace.

In general, we engage third parties to perform most of our final
    capping, closure and post-closure activities. Accordingly, the
    fair market value of these obligations is based on quoted and
    actual prices paid for similar work. We also perform some of our
    final capping, closure and post-closure activities using
    internal resources. Where internal resources are expected to be
    used to fulfill an asset retirement obligation, we have added a
    profit margin onto the estimated cost of such services to better
    reflect their fair market value as required by SFAS 143.
    These services primarily relate to managing construction
    activities during final capping, and maintenance activities
    during closure and post-closure. If we perform these services
    internally, the added profit margin would be recognized as a
    component of operating income in the period the obligation is
    settled.

SFAC 7 states that an estimate of fair value should include
    the price that marketplace participants are able to receive for
    bearing the uncertainties in cash flows. However, when utilizing
    discounted cash flow techniques, reliable estimates of market
    premiums may not be obtainable. In this situation, SFAC 7
    indicates that it is not necessary to consider a market risk
    premium in the determination of expected cash flows. While the
    cost of asset retirement obligations associated with final
    capping, closure and post-closure can be quantified and
    estimated, there is not an active market that can be utilized to
    determine the fair value of these activities. In the case of the
    waste industry, no market exists for selling the responsibility
    for final capping, closure and post-closure independent of
    selling the landfill in its entirety. Accordingly, we believe
    that it is not possible to develop a methodology to reliably
    estimate a market risk premium and have excluded a market risk
    premium from our determination of expected cash flow for
    landfill asset retirement obligations in accordance with SFAC 7.

Our estimates of costs to discharge asset retirement obligations
    for landfills are developed in today’s dollars. These costs
    are inflated each year to reflect a normal escalation of prices
    up to the year they are expected to be paid. We use a 2.5%
    inflation rate, which is based on the ten-year historical moving
    average increase of the U.S. Consumer Price Index, and is
    the rate used by most waste industry participants.

These estimated costs are then discounted to their present value
    using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. In general, the
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate we used for liability
    recognition was 6.6% and 6.5% for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which was based
    on the estimated all-in yield we would have needed to offer to
    sell thirty-year debt in the public market. However, our
    capping, closure and post-closure obligations acquired from
    Allied were recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition
    date, and were discounted using a rate of 9.75% due to market
    conditions in effect at the time of the acquisition.

Changes in asset retirement obligations due to the passage of
    time are measured by recognizing accretion expense in a manner
    that results in a constant effective interest rate being applied
    to the average carrying amount of the liability. The effective
    interest rate used to calculate accretion expense is our
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect at the time the
    liabilities were recorded.

In accordance with SFAS 143, changes due to revision of the
    estimates of the amount or timing of the original undiscounted
    cash flows used to record a liability are recognized by
    increasing or decreasing the carrying amount of the asset
    retirement obligation liability and the carrying amount of the
    related asset. Upward revisions in the amount of undiscounted
    estimated cash flows used to record a liability are discounted
    using the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect at the time
    of the change. Downward revisions in the amount of undiscounted
    estimated cash flows used to record a liability are discounted
    using the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate that existed when the
    original liability was recognized.

We review our calculations with respect to landfill asset
    retirement obligations at least annually. If there is a
    significant change in the facts and circumstances related to a
    landfill during the year, we will review our calculations for
    the landfill as soon as practical after the significant change
    has occurred.

Environmental
    Operating Costs

In the normal course of business, we incur various operating
    costs associated with environmental compliance. These costs
    include, among other things, leachate treatment and disposal,
    methane gas and groundwater monitoring and systems maintenance,
    interim cap maintenance, costs associated with the application
    of daily cover materials, and the legal and administrative costs
    of ongoing environmental compliance.

Environmental
    Remediation Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to
    the protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation
    at sites that we either



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

own or operate, including sites that we have acquired, or sites
    where we have (or a company that we have acquired has) delivered
    waste. Our environmental remediation liabilities primarily
    include costs associated with remediating groundwater, surface
    water and soil contamination, as well as controlling and
    containing methane gas migration. We periodically conduct
    environmental assessments of landfills and other properties that
    we own or operate, as well properties we are considering
    acquiring, in order to determine potential contamination or to
    monitor sites we are remediating.

We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our
    environmental remediation liabilities. Our estimates of these
    liabilities require assumptions about future events that are
    uncertain. Consequently, our estimates could change
    substantially as additional information becomes available
    regarding the nature or extent of contamination, the required
    remediation methods, the final apportionment of responsibility
    among the potentially responsible parties identified, the
    financial viability of those parties, and the actions of
    governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the
    matter.

The majority of our environmental remediation liabilities were
    acquired as part of our acquisition of Allied. We have accounted
    for the environmental remediation liabilities we acquired from
    Allied based on estimates of their fair values, and we have
    discounted these liabilities in accordance with SFAS 141.
    Prior to our acquisition of Allied, Allied’s environmental
    remediation liabilities were accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

(SFAS 5), and American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants Statement of Position

96-1,

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

(SOP 96-1),

which require that estimated losses be recorded for loss
    contingencies if, prior to the issuance of the financial
    statements, it is probable that liabilities have been incurred
    and the amounts of the losses can be reasonably estimated. If it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred, but no estimate
    of the liability is more likely than any other, a liability is
    recorded at the lower end of the range. However, amounts
    recorded under this guidance are generally not considered fair
    value.

Our process for determining the fair value for the environmental
    liabilities we acquired includes first identifying the
    population of sites that we either are or have indications that
    we may be responsible for the costs of remediation. These sites
    are then assessed to determine the risks that they are, or may
    be subject to, that would significantly affect either the cost
    or timing of remediation activities. We use these risk scenarios
    to develop estimates of future cash flows based on the risks
    identified. Generally speaking, sites with a higher risk of
    significant variability in future cash flows or timing of those
    cash flows have more risk scenarios identified than sites which
    we deem to be at a lower risk. We then probability-weight these
    risk scenarios and discount these liabilities to present value
    to determine their fair values. Although we have prepared and
    recorded a preliminary valuation of the environmental
    liabilities we acquired from Allied, we do not expect to
    complete our valuation of these liabilities until 2009. After we
    have finalized this valuation, future changes in these estimates
    will be recorded in accordance with SFAS 5 and

SOP 96-1.

Significant adjustments to these reserves may occur in the
    future.

Our other environmental liabilities are accounted for in
    accordance with SFAS 5 and

SOP 96-1.

The recorded liabilities represent our estimate of the most
    likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined
    liability is probable. These estimates do not take into account
    discounts to present value the total estimated costs. We
    reevaluate these matters as additional information becomes
    available to ascertain whether the liabilities we have accrued
    are adequate. We have not reduced the liabilities we have
    recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible
    parties or insurance companies.

Asset
    Impairments

We periodically evaluate whether events or changes in
    circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the
    estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets or whether the
    remaining balances of those assets should be evaluated for
    possible impairment in accordance with SFAS 144. Long-lived
    assets include, for example, capitalized landfill costs, other
    property and equipment, and identifiable intangible



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may indicate
    that an asset may be impaired include the following:

§

A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset
    group,

§

A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition,

§

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
    climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group,
    including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator,

§

An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
    originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a
    long-lived asset,

§

A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a
    history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or
    forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the
    use of a long-lived asset or asset group, or

§

A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived
    asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of
    significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
    life.

There are certain indicators listed above that require
    significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry
    when applied to landfill development or expansion. For example,
    a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit
    application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted.
    In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one
    landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill
    airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary
    course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators
    of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry.

If indicators of impairment exist, the asset or asset group is
    reviewed to determine whether its recoverability is impaired. We
    assess the recoverability of the asset or asset group by
    comparing its carrying value to an estimate (or estimates) of
    its undiscounted future cash flows over its remaining life. If
    the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group, we
    measure an impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The loss is recorded
    to the consolidated statement of income in the current period.
    Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and
    our projections of future cash flows and remaining useful lives
    may vary materially from actual results.

Self-Insurance
    Reserves

Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. Accruals for
    self-insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates
    of claims incurred but not reported. We consider our past claims
    experience, including both frequency and settlement amount of
    claims, in determining these estimates. It is possible that
    recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future
    payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to estimates recorded
    resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in the
    consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such
    adjustments are known. In general, our self-insurance reserves
    are recorded on an undiscounted basis. However, our estimate of
    the self-insurance liabilities we acquired in the acquisition of
    Allied have been recorded at fair value, and, therefore, have
    been discounted to present value based on our estimate of the
    timing of the related cash flows.

As we are the primary obligor for payment of all claims, we
    report our insurance claim liabilities on a gross basis in other
    current and long-term liabilities and any associated recoveries
    from our insurers are recorded in other assets.

Business
    Combinations

We acquire businesses in the waste industry, including
    non-hazardous waste collection, transfer and disposal
    operations, as part of our growth strategy. Businesses acquired
    are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under
    the purchase method of accounting, businesses are included in
    the consolidated financial statements from the date of
    acquisition. The cost of the acquired businesses is allocated to
    the assets and the liabilities acquired based on estimates of
    fair values thereof. These estimates are revised during the
    allocation period as necessary if, and when, information
    regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and
    quantify assets and liabilities acquired. The allocation period
    generally does not exceed one year. To the extent contingencies
    such as preacquisition environmental matters, litigation and
    related legal fees are resolved or settled during the allocation
    period, such items are included in the revised allocation of the
    purchase price. After the allocation period, the effect of
    changes in such contingencies is included in results of
    operations in the periods in which the adjustments are
    determined.

Discontinued
    Operations

We analyze our operations that have been divested or classified
    as

held-for-sale

in order to determine if they qualify for discontinued
    operations accounting. Only operations that qualify as a
    component of an entity under GAAP can be included in
    discontinued operations. Only components where we do not have
    significant continuing involvement with the divested operations
    would qualify for discontinued operations accounting. For our
    purposes, continuing involvement would include continuing to
    receive waste at our landfill or recycling facility from a
    divested hauling operation or transfer station or continuing to
    dispose of waste at a divested landfill or transfer station.
    After completing our analysis at December 31, 2008, we
    determined that our operations that qualify for discontinued
    operations accounting are not material to our consolidated
    statements of income and have not been presented separately as
    discontinued operations therein. See Note 3,

Business
    Acquisitions and Divestitures

, for additional information
    about discontinued operations.

Costs Associated
    with Exit Activities

We account for employee termination benefits that represent a
    one-time benefit in accordance with SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
    Activities

(SFAS 146). We record such costs into
    expense when management approves and commits to a plan of
    termination, and communicates the termination arrangement to the
    employees, or over the future service period, if any. Other
    costs associated with exit activities may include contract
    termination costs, including costs related to leased facilities
    to be abandoned or subleased, and facility and employee
    relocation costs, which are expensed as incurred.

In addition, we account for costs to exit an activity of an
    acquired company and involuntary employee termination benefits
    associated with acquired businesses in accordance with EITF
    Issue

No. 95-3,

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
    Business Combination

(EITF 95-3).

We include exit costs in the purchase price allocation of the
    acquired business if a plan to exit an activity of an acquired
    company exists, in accordance with the

EITF 95-3

criteria, and those costs have no future economic benefit to us
    and will be incurred as a direct result of the exit plan, or the
    exit costs represent amounts to be incurred by us under a
    contractual obligation of the acquired entity that existed prior
    to the acquisition date. We recognize employee termination
    benefits as liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date when
    management approves and commits to a plan of termination, and
    communicates the termination arrangement to the employees, if
    the future service period for these employees is less than sixty
    days from their date of notification.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and
    regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to
    significant uncertainty. In general, we determine whether to
    disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment
    of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or
    probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated in
    accordance with SFAS 5 and FASB Interpretation (FIN)
    No. 14,

Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss.

We assess our potential liability relating to litigation and
    regulatory matters based on information available to us.
    Management’s assessment is developed based on an analysis
    of possible outcomes under various strategies. We accrue for
    loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably
    estimable. If a contingent liability is only reasonably
    possible, we will disclose the potential range of the loss, if
    estimable.

Contingent liabilities recorded in purchase accounting are
    recorded at their fair values in accordance with SFAS 141.
    These fair values may be different from the values we would have
    otherwise recorded, had the contingent liability not been
    acquired as part of an acquisition of a business.

Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income

Accumulated other comprehensive income is a component of
    stockholders’ equity and includes the effective portion of
    the net changes in fair value of our effective cash flow hedges
    of prices for diesel fuel and other commodities, net of tax, and
    certain adjustments to liabilities associated with our employee
    benefit plan liabilities, net of tax.

Revenue
    Recognition

We generally provide services under contracts with
    municipalities or individual customers. Municipal and commercial
    contracts are generally long-term and often have renewal
    options. Advance billings are recorded as deferred revenue, and
    the revenue is then recognized over the period services are
    provided. Collection, transfer and disposal, and other services
    accounted for 77.7%, 17.9% and 4.4%, respectively, of
    consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    No one customer has individually accounted for more than 10% of
    our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in
    any of the past three years.

We recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are
    met:

§

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists such as a service
    agreement with a municipality, a hauling customer or a disposal
    customer,

§

Services have been performed such as the collection and hauling
    of waste or the disposal of waste at a disposal facility owned
    or operated by us,

§

The price of the services provided to the customer is fixed or
    determinable, and

§

Collectibility is reasonably assured.

Income
    Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and Puerto
    Rico. We account for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(SFAS 109). Accordingly, we record deferred income
    taxes to reflect the effects of temporary differences between
    the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax
    bases using enacted tax rates that we expect to be in effect
    when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.

We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these
    assets will more likely than not be realized. In making these
    determinations, we consider all available positive and negative
    evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax
    liabilities, tax planning strategies, projected future

taxable income and recent financial operating results. In the
    event we determine that we would be able to realize a deferred
    income tax asset in the future in excess of its net recorded
    amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance
    which would reduce the provision for income taxes.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

(FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting
    for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial
    statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48
    provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may
    be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position
    will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any
    related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical
    merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not
    recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.
    This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement,
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits within the provision for income taxes in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest
    and penalties are included within other current liabilities, and
    deferred income taxes and other long-term tax liabilities, in
    the consolidated balance sheets.

Defined Benefit
    Pension Plan

We assumed the BFI Retirement Plan (the Plan), which is a
    qualified defined benefit pension plan, as a result of our
    merger with Allied in December 2008. The Plan covers certain
    current and former employees of Allied in the United States,
    including some employees subject to collective bargaining
    agreements. The Plan’s benefit formula is based on a
    percentage of compensation as defined in the Plan document.
    However, the benefits of approximately 97% of the current plan
    participants were frozen upon Allied’s acquisition of BFI
    in 1999.

Our pension contributions will be made in accordance with
    funding standards established by the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code
    (IRC), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The
    Plan’s assets have been invested as determined by our
    Retirement Benefits Committee. We will annually review and
    adjust the Plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary.

The benefit obligation and associated income or expense related
    to the Plan are determined using annually established
    assumptions for discount rates, expected rates of return and
    average rates for compensation increases. We determine the
    discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and
    amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high
    quality bonds priced as of the pension plan measurement date.
    When that timing does not correspond to a published high-quality
    bond rate, our model uses an expected yield curve to determine
    an appropriate current discount rate. The yields on the bonds
    are used to derive a discount rate for the liability. In
    developing our expected rate of return assumption, we evaluate
    long-term expected and historical actual returns on the plan
    assets, giving consideration to our asset mix and the
    anticipated duration of our plan obligations. The average rate
    of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average
    pay increases over the periods benefits are earned. Our
    assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed
    necessary.

Equity-Based
    Compensation Plans

We account for equity-based compensation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123(R)). This statement requires companies to
    expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar
    equity instruments issued as compensation to employees over the
    requisite service periods.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SFAS 123(R) requires that cash flows resulting from tax
    benefits related to tax deductions in excess of those recorded
    for compensation expense, resulting from the exercise of stock
    options, be classified as cash flows from financing activities.
    All other tax benefits related to stock options have been
    presented as a component of cash flows from operating activities.

We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over
    the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion
    of the award, or to the employee’s retirement-eligible
    date, if earlier.

The fair value of each option on the date of grant is estimated
    using a lattice binomial option-pricing model based on certain
    valuation assumptions. Expected volatilities are based on our
    historical stock prices over the contractual terms of the
    options and other factors. The risk-free interest rates used are
    based on the published U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
    at the time of the grant for instruments with a similar life.
    The dividend yield reflects our dividend yield at the date of
    grant. The expected life represents the period that the stock
    options are expected to be outstanding, taking into
    consideration the contractual terms of the options and our
    employees’ historical exercise and post-vesting employment
    termination behavior, weighted to reflect the job level
    demographic profile of the employees receiving the option
    grants. The estimated forfeiture rate used to record
    compensation expense is based on historical forfeitures and is
    adjusted periodically based on actual results.

Leases

We lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of our
    business. Our most significant lease obligations are for
    property and equipment specific to our industry, including real
    property operated as a landfill or transfer station and
    operating equipment. Our leases have varying terms. Some may
    include renewal or purchase options, escalation clauses,
    restrictions, penalties or other obligations that we consider in
    determining minimum lease payments. The leases are classified as
    either operating leases or capital leases, as appropriate.

Operating
    Leases

Many of our leases are operating leases. This classification
    generally can be attributed to either (i) relatively low
    fixed minimum lease payments (including, for example, real
    property lease payments that are not fixed and vary based on the
    volume of waste we receive or process), or (ii) minimum
    lease terms that are much shorter than the assets’ economic
    useful lives. Management expects that, in the normal course of
    business, our operating leases will be renewed, replaced by
    other leases, or replaced with fixed asset expenditures.

Capital
    Leases

Assets acquired under capital leases are capitalized at the
    inception of each lease and are amortized over the lesser of the
    useful life of the asset or the lease term on either a
    straight-line or a

units-of-consumption

basis, depending on the asset leased. The present value of the
    related lease payments is recorded as a debt obligation.

Fair Value of
    Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments, as defined by SFAS No. 107,

Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments,

include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts
    receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and long-term
    debt. We have determined the estimated fair values of our
    financial instruments using available market information and
    commonly accepted valuation methodologies. However, considerable
    judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
    estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not
    necessarily indicative of the amounts that we, or holders of the
    instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use
    of different assumptions or



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

valuation methodologies could have a material effect on the
    estimated fair value amounts. The fair value estimates are based
    on information available as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.
    These amounts have not been revalued since those dates, and
    current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from
    the amounts presented.

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted
    cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
    liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the
    short-term maturities of these instruments. See Note 9,

Debt

, for the fair value disclosures related to our
    long-term debt.

Related Party
    Transactions

It is our policy that transactions with related parties must be
    on terms that, on the whole, are no less favorable than those
    that would be available from unaffiliated parties.

Recently Issued
    Accounting Pronouncements

FSP APB

14-1 —

Convertible Debt Instruments

In May 2008, the FASB directed the FASB Staff to issue FASB
    Staff Position (FSP) No. APB

14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)

(FSP APB

14-1).

FSP
    APB

14-1

applies to convertible debt instruments that, by their stated
    terms, may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion,
    including partial cash settlement of the conversion option. FSP
    APB

14-1

requires bifurcation of the instrument into a debt component
    that is initially recorded at fair value and an equity
    component. The difference between the fair value of the debt
    component and the initial proceeds from issuance of the
    instrument is recorded as a component of equity. The liability
    component of the debt instrument is accreted to par using the
    effective yield method; accretion is reported as a component of
    interest expense. The equity component is not subsequently
    re-valued as long as it continues to qualify for equity
    treatment. FSP APB

14-1

is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
    interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008 and must
    be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Early
    adoption is not permitted. We do not believe the impact of
    adopting FSP APB

14-1

will
    have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

SFAS 141(R) —
    Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141(R) which
    replaces SFAS 141. SFAS 141(R) applies to all
    transactions and other events in which one entity obtains
    control over one or more other businesses. Under
    SFAS 141(R), all transaction and restructuring charges are
    required to be recognized as expenses as incurred. The statement
    requires the fair value of the purchase consideration, including
    the issuance of equity securities, to be determined as of the
    acquisition date. It also requires the acquirer to recognize
    assets acquired, liabilities assumed, consideration paid and any
    noncontrolling interests acquired at their acquisition-date fair
    values. Changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and
    liabilities for tax uncertainties subsequent to the acquisition
    date that do not meet certain remeasurement criteria are also
    recorded in the income statement. The impact of the adoption of
    this statement on our consolidated financial statements is
    dependent on the nature and volume of future acquisitions, and,
    therefore, can not be determined at this time.

SFAS 141(R) is required to be applied prospectively, and,
    in general, will be effective for businesses we acquire on or
    after January 1, 2009. However, in the case of deferred tax
    asset valuation allowances and uncertain tax liability position
    liabilities we have recorded for acquisitions, the provisions of
    SFAS 141(R) as of its effective date will apply to the
    accounting for all business acquisitions, whether the
    acquisition occurred before or after that date.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On February 25, 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    FAS 141(R)-a,

Accounting for Assets Acquired and
    Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from
    Contingencies

, which amends the provisions related to the
    initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement, and
    disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies
    in a business combination under SFAS 141(R). The FASB voted
    to carry forward the requirements in SFAS 141 for acquired
    contingencies, which would require that such contingencies be
    recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date if fair
    value can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period.
    Otherwise, companies would typically account for the acquired
    contingencies in accordance with SFAS 5.

FSP

FAS 142-3 —

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets

In April 2008, the FASB directed the FASB Staff to issue FSP

FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

(FSP

FAS 142-3).

FSP

FAS 142-3

amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used for purposes of
    determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset
    under SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

. FSP

FAS 142-3

is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life
    of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the
    period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of
    the asset under SFAS 141(R) and other GAAP. FSP

FAS 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. Early application is not permitted. The impact of adopting
    FSP

FAS 142-3

will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

SFAS 157 —
    Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(SFAS 157). SFAS 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair
    value measurements. SFAS 157 applies to other accounting
    pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.
    Accordingly, SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements; but, for some entities, the application of
    SFAS 157 will change current practice. SFAS 157 was
    effective for us on January 1, 2008; however, in February
    2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. SFAS 157-2

(FSP 157-2)

which delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for
    items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
    financial statements on a recurring basis, for one year. We
    adopted SFAS 157 with respect to financial assets and
    liabilities beginning January 1, 2008. The adoption of
    SFAS 157 had no impact on our consolidated financial
    position, result of operations or cash flows as our historical
    method of obtaining the fair values of our derivative
    instruments is acceptable under SFAS 157. We intend to
    adopt the provisions of SFAS 157 with respect to our
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities effective
    January 1, 2009 pursuant to the requirements of

FSP 157-2.

SFAS 157 will impact accounting for fair values associated
    primarily with assets such as property and equipment, intangible
    assets and goodwill, but we do not believe it will have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

SFAS 159 —
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

(SFAS 159), which permits entities to
    choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other
    items at fair value. If elected, SFAS 159 was effective
    beginning January 1, 2008. Under SFAS 159, a company
    may elect to use fair value to measure eligible items at
    specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses
    on items for which the fair value option has been elected in
    earnings at each subsequent reporting date. Eligible items
    include, but were not limited to, accounts and loans receivable,

available-for-sale

and

held-to-maturity

securities, equity method investments, accounts payable,
    guarantees, issued debt and firm commitments.



REPUBLIC

We elected not to remeasure any financial instruments or other
    items at fair value under SFAS 159 as of January 1,
    2008.

SFAS 160 —
    Noncontrolling Interests

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51

(SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires noncontrolling
    interests or minority interests to be treated as a separate
    component of equity, not as a liability or other item outside of
    permanent equity. Upon a loss of control, the interests sold, as
    well as any interest retained, are required to be measured at
    fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.
    Additionally, when control is obtained and a previous equity
    interest was held, a gain or loss will be recognized in earnings
    for the difference between the fair value of the previously held
    equity interest and its carrying value. Based on SFAS 160,
    assets and liabilities will not change for subsequent purchase
    or sale transactions with noncontrolling interests as long as
    control is maintained. Differences between the fair value of
    consideration paid or received and the carrying value of
    noncontrolling interests are to be recognized as an adjustment
    to the parent interest’s equity. SFAS 160 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
    Earlier adoption is prohibited. SFAS 160 will be applied
    prospectively to all noncontrolling interests, including any
    that arose before the effective date except that comparative
    period information must be recast to classify noncontrolling
    interests in equity, attribute net income and other
    comprehensive income to noncontrolling interests, and provide
    other disclosures required by SFAS 160. Our minority
    interest liability for noncontrolling interests we assumed as
    part of the acquisition of Allied was $1.1 million at
    December 31, 2008. Therefore, we do not expect that the
    implementation of this pronouncement will have a material impact
    on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

SFAS 161 —
    Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133

(SFAS 161), which requires companies to
    provide enhanced disclosures regarding derivative instruments
    and hedging activities. It requires companies to better convey
    the purpose of derivative use in terms of the risks that they
    are intending to manage. Disclosures about (a) how and why
    an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under
    SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments

, and
    its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items affect a company’s
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows are
    required. This statement retains the same scope as SFAS 133
    and will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. As
    SFAS 161 relates specifically to disclosures, the adoption
    of this statement will have no impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

BUSINESS
    ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND
    RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

Merger with
    Allied Waste Industries, Inc.

Rationale for
    the Merger

We believe that our merger with Allied results in a combined
    company that has greater financial strength, operational
    efficiencies, earning power and growth potential than either we
    or Allied would have on our own. We believe that there is a
    substantial strategic fit between the markets serviced by
    Republic, which are located predominantly in high-growth Sunbelt
    markets, and those served by Allied, which has a national
    footprint. Since our collection markets are highly
    complementary, the combined company is diversified across
    geographic markets, customer segments and service offerings.
    This balance will allow



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

our combined company to capitalize on attractive business
    opportunities, mitigate geographic risk, and result in greater
    stability and predictability of revenue and free cash flow. We
    also believe that the merger should result in a number of
    important synergies, primarily from achieving greater operating
    efficiencies, capturing inherent economies of scale and
    leveraging corporate resources. Therefore, we believe that the
    9% premium we paid to effectuate the merger was reasonable.

Purchase
    Price

The purchase price paid for the acquisition of Allied that was
    effective December 5, 2008 includes the value of
    Republic’s common stock issued in exchange for
    Allied’s outstanding common stock, the conversion of
    Allied’s outstanding stock options and unvested restricted
    stock awards into Republic’s equity-based awards, the value
    of Allied’s debt and Republic’s transaction costs.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Allied stockholders were
    entitled to receive .45 shares of Republic common stock for
    each share of common stock held (the Exchange Ratio) at the
    effective time of the merger. Allied had 435.0 million
    shares of common stock outstanding as of December 5, 2008,
    including 1.5 million equity-based awards that had vested
    and settled through the issuance of Allied common stock at the
    effective time of the merger. The fair value assigned to each
    share of common stock was determined using the average closing
    prices of Republic’s common stock for the

five-day

period around June 23, 2008 (the announcement date).
    Therefore, to effect the transaction, approximately
    195.8 million shares of Republic’s common stock valued
    at $6.1 billion were issued to Allied stockholders.

In addition, Allied had stock options, restricted stock and
    other equity-based awards outstanding under the terms of its
    various equity-based incentive compensation plans and certain
    other agreements. Under the terms of these agreements,
    substantially all of these awards became fully vested upon the
    change in control. In accordance with the merger agreement, the
    stock options and any remaining unvested restricted stock were
    converted into Republic equity-based awards with like terms and
    conditions (except for the acceleration of the vesting of the
    awards as a result of the merger) at the effective time of the
    merger using the Exchange Ratio. As of December 5, 2008,
    approximately 7.6 million stock options and unvested other
    equity-based awards were issued in exchange for Allied’s
    outstanding equity-based awards as of the effective date of the
    merger. Under SFAS 123(R), the total fair value for the
    stock options of approximately $61.2 million (based on the
    average closing prices of Republic’s common stock for the

five-day

period around the announcement date), was recorded to additional
    paid-in capital as a component of purchase price. The unvested
    other equity-based awards will be recognized through
    compensation expense as they vest.

In summary, the purchase price paid for the acquisition of
    Allied consists of the following (in millions):

Allocation of
    Purchase Price

The allocation of purchase price to the fair value of the assets
    and liabilities acquired in the acquisition of Allied is
    preliminary and is subject to revision. Due to the volume and
    complexity of the information required to assess these assets
    and liabilities, we have not completed our valuation of certain
    significant balances including property and equipment, goodwill,
    accrued landfill and environmental costs (which includes
    landfill asset retirement obligations and environmental
    remediation liabilities), deferred taxes and other



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

long-term tax liabilities, and, included in other long-term
    liabilities, liabilities for litigation, claims and assessments,
    and self-insurance. Our preliminary purchase price allocation
    includes values we have finalized to date and preliminary
    estimates of the values we have not yet finalized. We expect our
    purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Allied to be
    completed during 2009. Adjustments after the allocation period
    made to assets and liabilities acquired, once we have finalized
    these balances, will be recorded in the consolidated statement
    of income.

Our preliminary allocation of purchase price is as follows (in
    millions):

Total purchase price

11,503.0

The fair values for the intangibles assets acquired were
    determined by identifying these assets using the intangible
    asset criteria of SFAS 141. All of Allied’s projected
    revenue streams and their related profits were then used to
    analyze the potential intangible assets. The intangible assets
    identified that were determined to have value as a result of
    this analysis include customer relationships, franchise
    agreements, other municipal agreements, non-compete agreements
    and tradenames. The fair values for these intangible assets are
    reflected in the table below. Other intangible assets were
    identified that are considered to be components of either
    property and equipment or goodwill under GAAP, including the
    value of the permitted and probable airspace at Allied’s
    landfills (property and equipment), the going concern element of
    Allied’s business (goodwill) and its assembled workforce
    (goodwill). The going concern element represents the ability of
    an established business to earn a higher rate of return on an
    assembled collection of net assets than would be expected if
    those assets had to be acquired separately. A substantial
    portion of this going concern element acquired is represented by
    Allied’s infrastructure of market-based collection routes
    and its related integrated waste transfer and disposal channels,
    whose value has been included in goodwill in accordance with
    SFAS 141.

The allocation of identifiable other intangible assets
    (excluding the allocation of purchase price to landfill airspace
    and goodwill) related to the acquisition of Allied is as follows

Assets Held For
    Sale

As a condition of the merger with Allied in December 2008, we
    reached a settlement with the DOJ requiring us to divest of
    certain operations serving fifteen metropolitan areas including
    Los Angeles, CA; San Francisco, CA; Denver, CO; Atlanta, GA;
    Northwestern Indiana; Lexington, KY; Flint, MI; Cape Girardeau,
    MO; Charlotte, NC; Cleveland, OH; Philadelphia, PA;
    Greenville-Spartanburg, SC; and Fort Worth, Houston and Lubbock,
    TX. The settlement requires us to divest 87 commercial waste
    collection routes, nine landfills and ten transfer stations,
    together with ancillary assets and, in three cases, access to
    landfill disposal capacity. We have classified the assets and
    liabilities we expect to divest (including accounts receivable,
    property and equipment, goodwill, and accrued landfill and
    environmental costs) as assets held for sale in our consolidated
    balance sheet at December 31, 2008.  The assets held for
    sale related to operations that were Republic’s prior to
    the merger with Allied have been adjusted to the lower of their
    carrying amounts or estimated fair values less costs to sell,
    which resulted in us recognizing an asset impairment loss of
    $6.1 million in our consolidated statement of income for
    the year ended December 31, 2008. The assets held for sale
    related to operations that were Allied’s prior to the
    merger are recorded at their estimated fair values in our
    consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 in
    accordance with the purchase method of accounting.

In February 2009, we entered into an agreement to divest certain
    assets to Waste Connections, Inc. The assets covered by the
    agreement include six municipal solid waste landfills, six
    collection operations and three transfer stations across the
    following seven markets: Los Angeles, CA; Denver, CO; Houston,
    TX; Lubbock, TX; Greenville-Spartanburg, SC; Charlotte, NC; and
    Flint, MI. The transaction with Waste Connections is subject to
    closing conditions regarding due diligence, regulatory approval
    and other customary matters. Closing is expected to occur in the
    second quarter of 2009.

Restructuring
    Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred
    $82.7 million of restructuring costs, primarily consisting
    of severance and other employee termination and relocation
    benefits and consulting fees paid to outside parties related to
    integrating the Allied and Republic operations. Substantially
    all restructuring charges relate to our corporate segment. As of
    December 31, 2008, our liabilities recorded for
    restructuring charges were $30.4 million and consisted of
    severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits
    incurred and unpaid. The majority of these benefit payments will
    be made in 2009.

Other
    Acquisitions

In addition to our acquisition of Allied, we acquired various
    other solid waste businesses during the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The aggregate purchase
    price paid for these transactions was $13.4 million,
    $4.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The
    amount for 2008 includes the acquisition of a transfer station
    in California.

Self-Insurance
    Reserves

Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. We carry general
    liability, vehicle liability, employment practices liability,
    pollution liability, directors and officers liability,
    workers’ compensation and employer’s liability
    coverage, as well as umbrella liability policies to provide
    excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these
    primary policies. We also carry property insurance. Claims in
    excess of self-insurance levels are fully insured subject to
    policy limits.

In general, our self-insurance reserves are recorded on an
    undiscounted basis. However, our estimate of the self-insurance
    liabilities we acquired in the acquisition of Allied have been
    recorded at fair value, and, therefore, have been discounted to
    present value using a rate of 9.75%. Discounted reserves are
    accreted to interest expense through the period that they are
    paid.

Our liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims
    at December 31, 2008 (which includes claims for
    workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability
    and employee health care benefits) were $385.3 million
    under our current risk management program and are included in
    other current  liabilities and other liabilities in our
    consolidated balance sheets. While the ultimate amount of claims
    incurred is dependent on future developments, in our opinion,
    recorded reserves are adequate to cover the future payment of
    claims. However, it is possible that recorded reserves may not
    be adequate to cover the future payment of claims. Adjustments,
    if any, to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim
    payments will be reflected in our consolidated statements of
    income in the periods in which such adjustments are known.

for further information regarding SFAS 143
    adjustments.

As of December 2008, we recorded a preliminary purchase price
    allocation of $813.1 million for the asset retirement
    obligations we acquired as part of the acquisition of Allied.
    The amounts we have recorded for these obligations are not
    comparable to the amounts Allied had recorded for these
    obligations. We have recorded these obligations at their
    estimated fair values using our credit-adjusted, risk-free rate
    at the time of the acquisition of 9.75%. In contrast, Allied had
    recorded these liabilities using a weighted-average
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate of 8.0%. Additionally, we have
    made certain changes to the processes Allied used for making the
    estimates needed to calculate asset retirement obligations in
    order to conform Republic’s and Allied’s methods for
    accounting for these obligations.

During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we
    reviewed our landfill asset retirement obligations for our
    landfills. As a result, we record a net increase of
    $.6 million, a net increase of $3.3 million and a net
    decrease of $2.3 million in amortization expense,
    respectively, primarily related to changes in estimates and
    assumptions concerning the cost and timing of future final
    capping, closure and post-closure activities.

As of December 2008, we recorded a preliminary purchase price

    liabilities we acquired as part of the acquisition of Allied.
    These liabilities represent our preliminary estimate of costs to
    remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by Allied
    or sites at which they, or a predecessor company that they had
    acquired, had been identified as a potentially responsible
    party. The remediation of these sites is in various stages of
    completion from having received an initial notice from a
    regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the
    final stages of postremedial monitoring. See also Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —
    Environmental Remediation Liabilities,

for further
    information. We have recorded these liabilities at their
    estimated fair values using a discount rate of 9.75%. Discounted
    liabilities are accreted to interest expense through the period
    that they are paid.

During 2007, we recorded pre-tax remediation charges of
    $44.6 million related to estimated costs to comply with
    Final Findings and Orders (F&Os) issued by the Ohio
    Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) in response to
    environmental conditions at our Countywide Recycling and
    Disposal Facility (Countywide) in East Sparta, Ohio and to
    undertake certain other remedial actions that we agreed with the
    OEPA to perform, including, without limitation, installing a
    “fire” break and removing liquids from gas extraction
    wells.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

During 2008, Republic Services of Ohio II, LLC (Republic-Ohio),
    an Ohio limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of
    ours and parent of Countywide, entered into an Agreed Order on
    Consent (AOC) with the EPA requiring the reimbursement of costs
    incurred by the EPA and requiring Republic-Ohio to
    (a) design and install a temperature and gas monitoring
    system, (b) design and install a composite cap or cover,
    and (c) develop and implement an air monitoring program.
    The AOC became effective on April 17, 2008 and
    Republic-Ohio is complying with the terms of the AOC. We also
    received additional orders from the OEPA. Based upon current
    information and engineering analyses and discussions with the
    OEPA and the EPA subsequent to the signing of the
    above-mentioned agreement, we recorded an additional pre-tax
    charge of $98.0 million for remediation costs in 2008.
    These costs include placing an enhanced cap (in excess of
    Countywide’s current permit requirements) over certain
    portions of the landfill.

We have requested relief with respect to certain requirements of
    the orders received from the OEPA as we believe the requirements
    should no longer be considered essential in light of the work we
    have now agreed with the EPA to perform.

While we are vigorously pursuing financial contributions from
    third parties for our costs to comply with the F&Os and the
    additional remedial actions, we have not recorded any
    receivables for potential recoveries.

The remediation liability remaining for Countywide as of
    December 31, 2008 is $95.4 million, of which
    approximately $29.5 million is expected to be paid out
    during 2009. The majority of the remaining costs are expected to
    be paid during 2010 and 2011.

During 2007, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $9.6 million
    associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs
    and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats
    leachate at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County,
    California. These additional costs are attributable to a consent
    agreement with the California Department of Toxic Substance
    Control. In 2008, we recorded an additional pre-tax charge of
    $21.9 million for increases in our estimates for leachate
    disposal costs and leachate treatment equipment at this facility.

On August 1, 2008, Republic Services of Southern Nevada
    (RSSN), a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, signed a Consent
    Decree and Settlement Agreement (Consent Decree) with the EPA,
    the Bureau of Land Management, and Clark County, Nevada related
    to the Sunrise Landfill. Under the Consent Decree, RSSN has
    agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the Sunrise
    Landfill for which RSSN and Clark County were otherwise jointly
    and severally liable. As a result, we recorded, based on
    management’s best estimates, a pre-tax charge of
    $35.0 million in 2008, of which $34.0 million was
    recorded for remediation costs associated with complying with
    the Consent Decree. RSSN is currently working with the Clark
    County Staff and Board of Commissioners to develop a mechanism
    to fund the costs to comply with the Consent Decree. However, we
    have not recorded any potential recoveries. The majority of this
    remediation liability is expected to be paid during 2009 and
    2010.

It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the
    charges noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional
    information, to the extent that such information impacts the
    costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future
    changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the
    required actions could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

No other significant amounts were charged to income for
    remediation costs during the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006.

Impact of Allied
    Merger on Supplemental Indentures for Certain Debt

On December 10, 2008, we received the requisite consents to
    amend the supplemental indentures governing certain outstanding
    debt securities of Allied Waste North America, Inc. (AWNA). The
    amendment to each supplemental indenture modified the ongoing
    reporting obligations required of



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Allied. Under the amended supplemental indentures, the ongoing
    reporting obligations may be satisfied by Republic.

The collateral that had secured the AWNA senior notes and the
    BFI Debentures (as defined below) equally and ratably with the
    Allied bank credit facility was released upon the completion of
    our merger with Allied and the repayment of that facility.

Revolving Credit
    Facilities

In April 2007, we increased our unsecured revolving credit
    facility from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion and
    extended the term from 2010 to 2012. In conjunction with the
    merger with Allied, we entered into an additional
    $1.75 billion revolving credit facility with a group of
    banks in September 2008. This credit facility was used initially
    at the time of the merger to refinance extensions of credit
    under Allied’s senior credit facility, to pay fees and
    expenses in connection therewith, and to pay fees and expenses
    incurred in connection with the merger. We also amended our
    existing $1.0 billion credit facility to conform certain
    terms of the facility to be consistent with the new
    $1.75 billion credit facility. We did not change the
    maturity date of the $1.0 billion credit facility.

The $1.0 billion revolving credit facility due April 2012
    and the $1.75 billion revolving credit facility due
    September 2013 (collectively, the Credit Facilities) bear
    interest at a Base Rate, or a Eurodollar Rate, both terms
    defined in the agreements, plus an applicable margin based on
    our Debt Ratings, also a term defined in the agreements. The
    Credit Facilities are also subject to facility fees based on
    applicable rates defined in the agreements and the aggregate
    commitments, regardless of usage. Borrowings under the Credit
    Facilities can be used for working capital, capital
    expenditures, letters of credit and other general corporate
    purposes. The agreements governing the Credit Facilities require
    us to maintain certain financial and other covenants. We have
    the ability to pay dividends and to repurchase common stock
    provided that we are in compliance with these covenants. At
    December 31, 2008, we had $.6 billion of Eurodollar
    Rate borrowings and $1.7 billion of letters of credit
    outstanding under the Credit Facilities, leaving
    $.4 billion of availability under the Credit Facilities. At
    December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the covenants
    of the Credit Facilities.

Receivables
    Secured Loans

We have an accounts receivable securitization program with two
    financial institutions which we acquired in the acquisition of
    Allied that allows us to borrow up to $400.0 million on a
    revolving basis under loan agreements secured by receivables.
    The agreements include a

364-day

liquidity facility secured by receivables. If we are unable to
    renew the liquidity facility when it matures on May 29,
    2009, we will refinance any amounts outstanding with our Credit
    Facilities or with other long-term borrowings. Although we
    intend to renew the liquidity facility no later than
    May 29, 2009 and do not expect to repay the amounts within
    the next twelve months, the loan is classified as current
    because it has a contractual maturity of less than one year.

The borrowings are secured by our accounts receivable. These
    receivables are held in and owned by a wholly owned and fully
    consolidated subsidiary. This subsidiary is a separate corporate
    entity whose assets, or collateral securing the borrowings, are
    available first to satisfy the claims of the subsidiary’s
    creditors. At December 31, 2008, the total amount of
    accounts receivable (gross) serving as collateral securing the
    borrowing was $520.8 million. Under SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities — a Replacement of
    FASB Statement 125

, the securitization program is accounted
    for as a secured borrowing with a pledge of collateral. The
    receivables and debt obligation remain on our consolidated
    balance sheet. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding
    borrowings under this program of $400.0 million. The
    borrowings under this program bear interest at the financial
    institutions’ commercial paper rate plus an applicable
    spread and interest is payable monthly.

Senior Notes and
    Debentures

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $99.3 million
    remaining of 7.125% unsecured notes due May 15, 2009.
    Interest is payable semi-annually in May and November.

We issued $450.0 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2011.
    Interest is payable semi-annually in February and August. The
    debt is presented net of the remaining unamortized discount of
    $.9 million and $1.2 million, and net of adjustments
    to fair market value of $15.1 million and
    $3.1 million, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, in the above table.

During March 2005, we exchanged $275.7 million of our
    outstanding 7.125% notes due 2009 for 6.086% notes due
    2035. We paid a premium of $27.6 million in connection with
    the exchange, which is being amortized over the life of the new
    notes using the effective yield method. The debt is presented
    net of the remaining unamortized discount of $.2 million
    and $.2 million, and the unamortized premium of
    $26.4 million and $26.8 million, as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in the above
    table.

    December 31, 2008, the unamortized adjustment to fair value
    was $94.0 million, which is being amortized over the
    remaining term of the notes.

Senior
    Subordinated Convertible Debentures

We acquired $230.0 million of 4.25% unsecured senior
    subordinated convertible debentures due 2034 as part of our
    acquisition of Allied. These debentures are convertible into
    5.1 million shares of our common stock at a conversion
    price of $45.40 per share. Common stock transactions such as
    cash or stock dividends, splits, combinations or
    reclassifications, and issuances at less than current market
    price require an adjustment to the conversion rate as defined by
    the indenture. Certain of the conversion features contained in
    the convertible debentures are deemed to be embedded
    derivatives, as defined under SFAS 133. However, these
    embedded derivatives currently have no value.

These debentures are convertible at the option of the holder
    anytime if any of the following occurs: (i) our closing
    stock price is in excess of $56.75 for 20 of 30 consecutive
    trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarter,
    (ii) during the five business day period after any three
    consecutive trading days in which the average trading price per
    debenture is less than 98% of the product of the closing price
    for our common stock times the conversion rate, (iii) we
    issue a call notice, or (iv) certain specified corporate
    events occur such as a merger or change in control.

We can elect to settle the conversion in stock, cash or a
    combination of stock and cash. If settled in stock, the holder
    will receive the fixed number of shares based on the conversion
    rate except, if conversion occurs after 2029 as a result of item
    (ii) above, the holder will receive shares equal to the par
    value divided by the trading stock price. If settled in cash,
    the holder will receive the cash equivalent of the number of
    shares based on the conversion rate at the average trading stock
    price over a ten day period except, if conversion occurs as a
    result of item (iv) above, the holder will then receive
    cash equal to the par value only.

We can elect to call the debentures at any time after
    April 15, 2009 at par for cash only. The holders can
    require us to redeem some or all of the debentures on April 15th
    of 2011, 2014, 2019, 2024 and 2029 at par for stock, cash or a
    combination of stock and cash at our option. If the debentures
    are redeemed in stock,

the number of shares issued will be determined as the par value
    of the debentures divided by the average trading stock price
    over the preceding

five-day

period.

At December 31, 2008, the unamortized adjustment to fair
    value for these debentures was $28.7 million, which is
    being amortized through April 15, 2011, the first date that
    the holders can require us to redeem the debentures.

Tax-Exempt
    Financings

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $1.3 billion
    and $.7 billion of fixed and variable rate tax-exempt
    financings outstanding, respectively, with maturities ranging
    from 2010 to 2037. During 2008, we issued $207.4 million of
    tax-exempt bonds. In addition, we acquired $527.0 million
    of tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings as part of
    our acquisition of Allied in December 2008. At December 31,
    2008, the total of the unamortized adjustments to fair value for
    these financings was $52.9 million, which is being
    amortized to interest expense over the remaining terms of the
    debt.

Approximately two-thirds of our tax-exempt financings are
    remarketed weekly or daily, by a remarketing agent to
    effectively maintain a variable yield. These variable rate
    tax-exempt financings are credit enhanced with letters of credit
    having terms in excess of one year issued by banks with credit
    ratings of AA or better. The holders of the bonds can put them
    back to the remarketing agent at the end of each interest
    period. To date, the remarketing agents have been able to
    remarket our variable rate unsecured tax-exempt bonds.

As of December 31, 2008, we had $281.9 million of
    restricted cash, of which $133.5 million was proceeds from
    the issuance of tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings
    and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of
    the agreements. Restricted cash also includes amounts held in
    trust as a financial guarantee of our performance.

Other
    Debt

Other debt primarily includes capital lease liabilities of
    $139.5 million and $35.4 million as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, with maturities
    ranging from 2009 to 2042.

Fair Value of
    Debt

The fair value of our fixed rate senior notes and tax-exempt
    financings using quoted market rates is $6.1 billion and
    $1.1 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The carrying value of these fixed rate unsecured
    notes and tax-exempt financings is $6.6 billion and
    $1.1 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The carrying amounts of our remaining notes
    payable and tax-exempt financing approximate fair value because
    interest rates are variable and, accordingly, approximate
    current market rates for instruments with similar risk and
    maturities. The fair value of our debt is determined as of the
    balance sheet date and is subject to change. For active hedge
    arrangements, the fair value of the derivatives is included in
    the consolidated balance sheets.

Guarantees

Substantially all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our
    obligations under the Credit Facilities.

We and substantially all of our subsidiaries (including
    substantially all of the subsidiaries of Allied) had guaranteed
    nine series of senior notes issued by AWNA, a subsidiary of
    Allied (the AWNA Senior Notes). The guarantees of the AWNA
    Senior Notes by our subsidiaries (other than the guarantee of
    Allied) were automatically released upon the release of such
    subsidiaries from their guarantee obligations under the Credit
    Facilities.

We and substantially all of our subsidiaries (including
    substantially all of the subsidiaries of Allied) had also
    guaranteed the 9.25% debentures due 2021 and the
    7.40% debentures due 2035 issued by Browning-Ferris
    Industries, LLC (successor to Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc.),
    another subsidiary of Allied (the BFI Debentures). The
    guarantees of the BFI Debentures by our subsidiaries (other than
    the guarantees of Allied and AWNA) were automatically released
    upon the release of such subsidiaries from their guarantee
    obligations under the Credit Facilities.

Substantially all of our subsidiaries (including Allied and
    substantially all of its subsidiaries) have guaranteed our
    7.125% senior notes due 2009, our 6.75% senior notes
    due 2011 and our 6.086% senior notes due 2035 (the Republic
    Senior Notes). The guarantees of the Republic Senior Notes by
    our subsidiaries would be automatically released upon the
    release of such subsidiaries from their guarantee obligations
    under the Credit Facilities.

We have guaranteed some of the tax-exempt bonds of our
    subsidiaries. If a subsidiary fails to meet its obligations
    associated with tax-exempt bonds as they come due, we will be
    required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No
    additional liability has been recorded for these guarantees
    because the underlying obligations are reflected in our
    consolidated balance sheets.

Interest
    Paid

Interest paid was $93.7 million, $95.2 million and
    $95.4 million (net of capitalized interest of
    $2.6 million, $3.0 million and $2.7 million) for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Interest Rate
    Swap Agreements

Our ability to obtain financing through the capital markets is a
    key component of our financial strategy. Historically, we have
    managed risk associated with executing this strategy,
    particularly as it relates to fluctuations in interest rates, by
    using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. We also
    entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage risk
    associated with fluctuations in interest rates. The swap
    agreements have a total notional value of $210.0 million
    and mature in August 2011. This maturity is identical to our
    unsecured notes that also mature in 2011. Under the swap
    agreements, we pay interest at floating rates based on changes
    in LIBOR and receive interest at fixed rates of 6.75%. We have
    designated



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

these agreements as hedges in changes in the fair value of our
    fixed-rate debt and account for them in accordance with
    SFAS 133. We have determined that these agreements qualify
    for the short-cut method under SFAS 133 and, therefore,
    changes in the fair value of the agreements are assumed to be
    perfectly effective in hedging changes in the fair value of our
    fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, interest rate swap
    agreements are reflected at their fair market value of
    $15.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, and are
    included in other assets and as an adjustment to long-term debt
    in our consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recorded net interest
    income of $3.8 million and net interest expense of
    $2.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively, related
    to our interest rate swap agreements, which is included in
    interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.

Certain amounts above have been
    reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.

We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from
    certain state net operating loss carryforwards will not be
    realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a
    valuation allowance of $156.4 million on deferred tax
    assets relating to these state net operating loss carryforwards.
    In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
    management considers whether it is more likely than not that
    some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized after the initial recognition of the deferred tax
    asset. We provide valuation allowances, as needed, to offset
    portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding
    the future realization of such deferred tax assets. We adjust
    the valuation allowance in the period management determines it
    is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will
    not be realized.

We have recorded $107.1 million of deferred tax assets and
    $774.1 million of deferred income taxes and other long-term
    tax liabilities as part of our preliminary purchase price
    allocation for our acquisition of Allied. This allocation is
    subject to change until we finalize our valuations and other
    estimates in 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a tax
    charge of $12.3 million related to non-deductible
    compensation payouts as a result of the merger with Allied.
    During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a net
    tax benefit of $4.8 million in our provision for income
    taxes related to the resolution of various tax matters,
    including the effective completion of the Internal Revenue
    Service (IRS) audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal
    years 2001 through 2004. Income tax expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 includes a $5.1 million benefit
    related to the resolution of various income tax matters,
    including the effective completion of IRS audits for the years
    1998 through 2000.

We made income tax payments (net of refunds received) of
    approximately $128.3 million, $151.9 million and
    $198.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, approximately
    $32.0 million of federal tax payments have been deferred
    until February 2009 as a result of the merger with Allied.
    Approximately $83.0 million of income taxes paid during the
    year ended December 31, 2006 related to fiscal 2005. This
    $83.0 million payment had been deferred as a result of an
    IRS notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48 which clarifies the
    accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum
    recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before
    being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification,
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and
    transition, and required expanded disclosure with respect to the
    uncertainty in income taxes. We adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross
    unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 is as
    follows (in millions):

Included in the balance at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are
    approximately $461.0 million and $7.7 million,
    respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits (net of the federal
    benefit on state issues) that, if recognized, would affect the
    effective income tax rate in future periods.

SFAS 141(R) is effective for financial statements issued
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.
    SFAS 141(R) significantly changes the treatment of acquired
    uncertain tax liabilities. Under SFAS 141, changes in
    acquired uncertain tax liabilities were recognized through
    goodwill. Under SFAS 141(R), changes in acquired
    unrecognized tax liabilities are recognized through the income
    tax provision. As of December 31, 2008, $582.9 million
    of the $611.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits related
    to tax positions Allied had taken prior to the merger. Of the
    $582.9 million of acquired unrecognized benefits,
    $449.6 million, if recognized in the income tax provision,
    would affect our effective tax rate.

We recognize interest and penalties as incurred within the
    provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of
    income. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, we
    accrued penalties of $.2 million and interest of
    $5.2 million during 2008, and, in total as of
    December 31, 2008, have recognized a liability for
    penalties of $88.1 million and interest of
    $180.0 million. During 2007, we accrued interest of
    $.9 million and, in total as of December 31, 2007, had
    recognized a liability for penalties and interest of
    $5.5 million.

Gross unrecognized tax benefits that we expect to settle in the
    following twelve months are in the range of $10.0 million
    to $20.0 million. It is reasonably possible that the amount
    of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease in the
    next twelve months.

We and our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the
    U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as income tax in multiple
    state jurisdictions. We have acquired Allied’s open tax
    periods as part of the acquisition. Allied is currently under
    examination or administrative review by various state and
    federal taxing authorities for certain tax years, including
    federal income tax audits for calendar years 2000 through 2006.
    We are also engaged in tax litigation related to our risk
    management companies which are subsidiaries of Allied. These
    matters are further discussed below.

We are subject to various federal, foreign, state and local tax
    rules and regulations. Our compliance with such rules and
    regulations is periodically audited by tax authorities. These
    authorities may challenge the



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

positions taken in our tax filings. As such, to provide for
    certain potential tax exposures, we maintain liabilities for
    uncertain tax positions for our estimate of the final outcome of
    the examinations.

We believe that the liabilities for uncertain tax positions
    recorded are adequate. However, a significant assessment against
    us in excess of the liabilities recorded could have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

Risk
    Management Companies

Prior to Allied’s acquisition of BFI in July 1999, certain
    BFI operating companies, as part of a risk management initiative
    to manage and reduce costs associated with certain liabilities,
    contributed assets and existing environmental and self-insurance
    liabilities to six fully consolidated BFI risk management
    companies (RMCs) in exchange for stock representing a minority
    ownership interest in the RMCs. Subsequently, the BFI operating
    companies sold that stock in the RMCs to third parties at fair
    market value which resulted in a capital loss of approximately
    $900.0 million for tax purposes, calculated as the excess
    of the tax basis of the stock over the cash proceeds received.

On January 18, 2001, the IRS designated this type of
    transaction and other similar transactions as a
    “potentially abusive tax shelter” under IRS
    regulations. During 2002, the IRS proposed the disallowance of
    all of this capital loss. At the time of the disallowance, the
    primary argument advanced by the IRS for disallowing the capital
    loss was that the tax basis of the stock of the RMCs received by
    the BFI operating companies was required to be reduced by the
    amount of liabilities acquired by the RMCs even though such
    liabilities were contingent and, therefore, not liabilities
    recognized for tax purposes. Under the IRS interpretation, there
    was no capital loss on the sale of the stock since the tax basis
    of the stock should have approximated the proceeds received.
    Allied protested the disallowance to the Appeals Office of the
    IRS in August 2002.

In April 2005, the Appeals Office of the IRS upheld the
    disallowance of the capital loss deduction. As a result, in late
    April 2005 Allied paid a deficiency to the IRS of
    $22.6 million for BFI tax years prior to the acquisition.
    Allied also received a notification from the IRS assessing a
    penalty of $5.4 million and interest of $12.8 million
    relating to the asserted $22.6 million deficiency. In July
    2005, Allied filed a suit for refund in the United States Court
    of Federal Claims (CFC). The DOJ thereafter filed a counterclaim
    in the case for the $5.4 million penalty and
    $12.8 million of interest claimed by the IRS. In December
    2005, the IRS agreed to suspend the collection of this penalty
    and interest until a decision is rendered on Allied’s suit
    for refund.

In July 2006, while the CFC case was pending, Allied discovered
    what it construed to be a jurisdictional defect in the case that
    could have prevented its recovery of the refund amounts claimed
    even if Allied would have been successful on the underlying
    merits. Accordingly, in September 2006, Allied filed a
    motion to dismiss the case without prejudice on jurisdictional
    grounds. In March 2007, the CFC granted Allied’s motion
    dismissing the case. Thereafter, in July 2007, the government
    appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for
    the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit). In April 2008, the
    Federal Circuit reversed the lower court’s decision and
    remanded the case back to the CFC for further proceedings. In
    May 2008, Allied filed a petition for panel rehearing with the
    Federal Circuit, requesting that the court reconsider its
    ruling. In June 2008, the Federal Circuit denied Allied’s
    petition.

In December 2008, subsequent to our acquisition of Allied, a
    hearing was held in the CFC. At this hearing, we informed the
    judge of our intention to withdraw our suit from the CFC in
    order to continue to litigate the merits of our position in the
    U.S. District Court of Arizona. We believe the decisional
    law applicable to this matter is more favorable to taxpayers in
    the U.S. District Court of Arizona than in the CFC.

To expedite the withdrawal from the CFC, in January 2009, we
    paid the government’s counterclaim for penalty and penalty
    interest of approximately $11.0 million. Prior to
    December 31, 2008, Allied had already paid
    $51.0 million in tax and related interest relating to the
    1997 through 1999 BFI tax years. As a result, all



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

tax, interest and penalties related to the 1997 through 1999 BFI
    tax years have been paid, which are the tax years under CFC
    jurisdiction. If, in response to our decision to withdraw our
    suit from the CFC, the court issues an order dismissing the case
    with prejudice, the tax, interest and penalty amounts paid by us
    will not be recoverable in any subsequent action. However, if
    the court issues an order dismissing the case without prejudice,
    we will not be entirely prevented from asserting a claim
    contesting the IRS tax adjustment applicable to the 1997 through
    1999 BFI tax years and seeking the recovery of some or all of
    the tax, interest and penalty amounts previously paid, although
    some of our claim may be barred by the applicable statute of
    limitations.

In addition, Allied has a second refund suit currently pending
    in Arizona. In August 2008, Allied received from the IRS a
    Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) related to its
    utilization of BFI’s capital loss carryforward on
    Allied’s 1999 tax return. Because of the high rate of
    interest associated with this matter, Allied previously paid all
    tax and interest related to this tax year. Consequently, the
    Notice related only to the IRS’ asserted penalty for
    Allied’s 1999 tax year. On October 30, 2008, Allied
    filed a suit for refund in the U.S. District Court of
    Arizona. We anticipate that the DOJ will file a counterclaim for
    the asserted penalty and, consequently, the IRS will suspend
    collection of the penalty, as occurred in connection with the
    BFI CFC action. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS
    will suspend collection efforts.

If the capital loss deduction is fully disallowed for all
    applicable years, we estimate that it would have a total cash
    impact (including amounts already paid to the IRS as described
    below) of approximately $457.0 million related to federal
    taxes, state taxes and interest, and, approximately
    $164.0 million related to penalty and penalty-related
    interest. These amounts have been fully accrued in our
    consolidated balance sheet, and therefore, disallowance would
    not materially affect our consolidated results of operations.
    However, a payment beyond the amounts already paid would
    adversely impact our cash flow in the period such payment was
    made. The accrual of additional interest charges through the
    time these matters are resolved will affect our consolidated
    results of operations. Due to the high rate of interest
    associated with this matter, we or Allied have previously paid
    the IRS and various state tax authorities $369.0 million
    related to capital loss deductions taken on BFI’s 1997
    through 1999 and Allied’s 1999 through 2002 tax returns. In
    addition, we or Allied have paid approximately
    $11.0 million of penalty and penalty-related interest for
    our refund suit in the CFC. Although we have fully accrued all
    tax, interest, penalty, and penalty-related interest relating to
    this matter, we intend to vigorously pursue our claim for refund
    of the tax and interest and our defense to the IRS’ claims
    for penalties and penalty-related interest. While there can be
    no assurances, we anticipate that the final resolution of the
    dispute, through adjudication or settlement, may be more
    favorable than the full amount currently accrued for tax,
    interest, penalty and penalty-related interest.

Exchange of
    Partnership Interests

In April 2002, Allied exchanged minority partnership interests
    in four

waste-to-energy

facilities for majority partnership interests in equipment
    purchasing businesses, which are now wholly owned subsidiaries.
    In November 2008, the IRS issued a formal disallowance to Allied
    contending that the exchange was instead a sale on which a
    corresponding gain should have been recognized. Although we
    intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter, if the
    exchange is treated as a sale, we estimate it could have a
    potential federal and state cash tax impact of approximately
    $156.0 million plus accrued interest through
    December 31, 2008 of approximately $48.0 million. In
    addition, the IRS has asserted a penalty of 20% of the
    additional income tax due. The potential tax and interest (but
    not penalty or penalty-related interest) of a full adjustment
    for this matter have been fully reserved in our consolidated
    balance sheet at December 31, 2008. The successful
    assertion by the IRS of penalty and penalty-related interest in
    connection with this matter could have a material adverse impact
    on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

Methane
    Gas

As part of its examination of Allied’s 2000 through 2003
    federal income tax returns, the IRS reviewed Allied’s
    treatment of costs associated with its landfill operations. As a
    result of this review, the IRS has proposed that certain
    landfill costs be allocated to the collection and control of
    methane gas that is naturally produced within the landfill. The
    IRS’ position is that the methane gas produced by a
    landfill is a joint product resulting from operation of the
    landfill and, therefore, these costs should not be expensed
    until the methane gas is sold or otherwise disposed.

We plan to contest this issue at the Appeals Office of the IRS.
    We believe we have several meritorious defenses, including the
    fact that methane gas is not actively produced for sale by us
    but rather arises naturally in the context of providing disposal
    services. Therefore, we believe that the subsequent resolution
    of this issue will not have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

From 2000 through 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $2.6 billion of our common stock. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had paid $2.3 billion to
    repurchase 82.6 million shares of our common stock, of
    which 4.6 million shares were acquired during the year
    ended December 31, 2008 for $138.4 million. During the
    second quarter of 2008, we suspended our share repurchase
    program as a result of the pending merger with Allied. We expect
    that our share repurchase program will continue to be suspended
    until at least 2011.

In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a

3-for-2

stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effective on
    March 16, 2007, to stockholders of record as of
    March 5, 2007. We distributed 64.5 million shares from
    treasury stock to effect the stock split. In connection
    therewith, we transferred $1.6 billion from treasury stock
    to additional paid-in capital and $.2 billion from treasury
    stock to retained earnings, representing in total the
    weighted-average cost of the treasury shares distributed.

We initiated a quarterly cash dividend in July 2003. The
    dividend has been increased each year thereafter, with the
    latest increase occurring in the third quarter of 2008. Our
    current quarterly dividend per share is $.19. Dividends declared
    were $168.9 million, $104.6 million and
    $79.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, we
    recorded a quarterly dividend payable of approximately
    $72.0 million to stockholders of record at the close of
    business on January 2, 2009.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
    PLANS

Stock-Based
    Compensation

In July 1998, we adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (1998
    Plan) to provide for grants of options to purchase shares of
    common stock, restricted stock and other equity-based
    compensation to our employees and non-employee directors who are
    eligible to participate in the 1998 Plan. The 1998 Plan expired
    on June 30, 2008. In February 2007, our Board of Directors
    approved the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (2007 Plan) to replace
    the 1998 Plan when it expired. The 2007 Plan was approved by our
    stockholders in May 2007. We believe that such awards better
    align the interests of our employees with those of our
    stockholders. Shares reserved for future grants under the 2007
    Plan are 6.8 million as of December 31, 2008.

Options granted under the 1998 Plan and the 2007 Plan are
    non-qualified and are granted at a price equal to the fair
    market value of our common stock at the date of grant.
    Generally, options granted have a term of seven to ten years
    from the date of grant, and vest in increments of 25% per year
    over a four year period

    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

beginning on the first anniversary date of the grant. Options
    granted to non-employee directors have a term of ten years and
    are fully vested at the grant date.

In December 2008, the Board of Directors adopted the Republic
    Services, Inc. 2006 Incentive Stock Plan (f/k/a the Allied Waste
    Industries, Inc. 2006 Incentive Stock Plan (the 2006 Plan)) as
    amended and restated effective December 5, 2008.
    Allied’s stockholders approved the 2006 Plan in May 2006.
    The 2006 Plan was amended and restated effective
    December 5, 2008 to reflect that Republic Services, Inc. is
    the new sponsor of the Plan, that any references to shares of
    common stock is to shares of common stock of Republic Services,
    Inc., and to adjust outstanding awards and the number of shares
    available under the Plan to reflect the merger. The 2006 Plan,
    as amended and restated, provides for the grant of non-qualified
    stock options, incentive stock options, shares of restricted
    stock, shares of phantom stock, stock bonuses, restricted stock
    units, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, dividend
    equivalents, cash awards, or other stock-based awards. Awards
    granted under the 2006 Plan prior to December 5, 2008
    became fully vested and nonforfeitable upon the closing of the
    merger. Awards may be granted under the 2006 Plan, as amended
    and restated, after December 5, 2008 only to employees and
    consultants of Allied Waste Industries, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries who were not employed by Republic Services, Inc.
    prior to such date. At December 31, 2008, there were
    approximately 14.0 million shares of common stock available
    for award under the 2006 Plan.

Stock
    Options

We use a lattice binomial option-pricing model to value our
    stock option grants. We recognize compensation expense on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each
    separately vesting portion of the award, or to the
    employee’s retirement eligible date, if earlier. The
    weighted-average estimated fair values of stock options granted
    during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
    were $4.36, $6.49 and $6.21 per option, respectively, which were

Stock options granted in 2008 primarily include stock option
    granted as part our annual grant to employees in February 2008,
    as part of our new annual grants program in December 2008 and as
    grants of replacement options for Allied’s outstanding
    stock options as of the effective date of the merger, in
    accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. In December
    2008, we replaced Allied’s outstanding, vested stock
    options with Republic stock options with similar terms and
    conditions, and recorded a credit to additional-paid-in-capital
    of $61.2 million as part of the purchase price paid for the
    acquisition.

Additionally, as of the effective date of the merger with Allied
    in December 2008, all of Republic’s unvested stock options
    outstanding were vested in accordance with the change in control
    provisions of the 1998 and 2007 Plans. We recorded compensation
    expense of $6.5 million in December 2008 to recognize the
    immediate vesting of the stock options.

During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    compensation expense for stock options was $14.0 million,
    $6.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, total unrecognized compensation
    expense related to outstanding stock options was
    $14.1 million, which will be recognized over a weighted
    average period of 2.5 years. The total fair value of stock
    options that vested in 2008 and 2007 was $21.5 million and
    $2.3 million. No stock options vested in 2006.

We classified excess tax benefits of $4.5 million,
    $6.0 million and $13.8 million as cash flows from
    financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. All other tax benefits related to
    stock options have been presented as a component of cash flows
    from operating activities.

During each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
    2006, we awarded 36,000 deferred stock units to our non-employee
    directors under our 1998 Plan. These stock units vest
    immediately, but the directors receive the underlying shares
    only after their board service ends or a change in control
    occurs, as defined by the 1998 and 2007 Plans. The stock units
    do not carry any voting or dividend rights, except the right to
    receive additional stock units in lieu of dividends.

Also during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
    2006, we awarded 426,670, 185,820 and 127,500 shares of
    restricted stock, respectively, to our executive officers, of
    which 236,170 granted during 2008 were granted as part of our
    new annual grant program in December 2008. 21,000 and 19,500 of
    the shares awarded during 2007 and 2006, respectively, vested
    effective January 1 of the subsequent year. 392,170, 135,000 and
    108,000, respectively, of the shares awarded vest in four equal
    annual installments beginning on the anniversary date of the
    original grant except that vesting may be accelerated if certain
    performance targets are achieved or under certain other
    conditions. The remaining 30,000 and 29,820 shares awarded
    during 2008 and 2007, respectively, had an original vesting date
    of December 31, 2008. During the vesting period, the
    participants have voting rights and receive dividends declared
    and paid on the shares, but the shares may not be sold,
    assigned, transferred or otherwise encumbered. Additionally,
    granted but unvested shares are forfeited in the event the
    participant resigns employment with us for other than good
    reason.

The fair value of stock units and restricted shares on the date
    of grant is amortized ratably over the vesting period, or the
    accelerated vesting period if certain performance targets are
    achieved.

As of the effective date of the merger with Allied of
    December 5, 2008, all of Republic’s restricted stock
    outstanding and unvested was vested in accordance with the
    change in control provisions of the 1998 and 2007 Plans. We
    recorded compensation expense of $5.3 million in December
    2008 to recognize the immediate vesting of the restricted stock.
    In addition, the deferred stock units were vested and a cash
    payment was made totaling $4.0 million based on the fair
    value of the deferred stock units as of the date of vesting.

Defined Benefit
    Pension Plan

We currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan,
    the BFI Retirement Plan (the Plan), which we acquired as part of
    our acquisition of Allied in December 2008. The Plan covers
    certain employees in the United States, including some employees
    subject to collective bargaining agreements.

The Plan benefits are frozen. Interest credits continue to be
    earned by participants in the Plan, and participants whose
    collective bargaining agreements provide for additional benefit
    accruals under the Plan continue to receive those credits in
    accordance with the terms of their bargaining agreements. The
    Plan was converted from a traditional defined benefit plan to a
    cash balance plan in 1993.

During 2002, the Plan and the Pension Plan of San Mateo
    County Scavenger Company and Affiliated Divisions of
    Browning-Ferris Industries of California, Inc. (San Mateo
    Pension Plan) were merged into one plan. However, benefits
    continue to be determined under two separate benefit structures.

Prior to the conversion of the cash balance design, benefits
    payable as a single life annuity under the Plan were based on
    the participant’s highest five years of earnings out of the
    last ten years of service. Upon conversion to the cash balance
    plan, the existing accrued benefits were converted to a lump-sum
    value using the actuarial assumptions in effect at the time.
    Participants’ cash balance accounts are increased until
    retirement by certain benefit and interest credits under the
    terms of their bargaining agreements. Participants may elect
    early retirement with the attainment of age 55 and
    completion of 10 years of credited service at reduced
    benefits. Participants with 35 years of service may retire
    at age 62 without any reduction in benefits.

The San Mateo Pension Plan covers certain employees at the
    San Mateo location excluding employees who are covered
    under collective bargaining agreements under which benefits had
    been the subject of good faith bargaining unless the collective
    bargaining agreement otherwise provides for such coverage.
    Benefits are based on the participant’s highest five years
    of average earnings out of the last fifteen years of service.
    Effective January 1, 2004, participants who have attained
    the age of 55 and completed 30 years of credited service
    may elect early retirement without any reduction in benefits.
    Effective January 1, 2006, the San Mateo Pension Plan
    was amended to modify the definition of eligible employees to
    exclude highly compensated employees. In addition, no new
    employees hired or rehired after December 31, 2005 are
    eligible to participate in or accrue a benefit under the
    San Mateo Pension Plan.

Our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding
    standards established by ERISA and the IRC, as amended by the
    Pension Protection Act of 2006. No contributions are anticipated
    for 2009.

Our disclosures below were prepared as of the measurement date
    of December 31, 2008 and are presented in accordance with
    SFAS No. 132(R),

Employers’ Disclosures about
    Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

.

In conjunction with the acquisition of Allied, we acquired
    pension obligations associated with the Plan of
    $335.9 million and Plan assets of $274.2 million as of
    the acquisition date. The Plan’s unfunded status as of the
    acquisition date was primarily a result of market conditions in
    effect at the time.

We determine the discount rate used in the measurement of our
    obligations based on a model which matches the timing and amount
    of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds
    priced as of the pension plan measurement date. Where that
    timing does not correspond to a published high-quality bond
    rate, our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an
    appropriate current discount rate. The yields on the bonds are
    used to derive a discount rate for the liability. The term of
    our obligation, based on the expected retirement dates of our
    workforce, is approximately ten years.

In developing our expected rate of return assumption, we have
    evaluated the actual historical performance and long-term return
    projections of the Plan assets, which give consideration to the
    asset mix and the anticipated timing of the pension plan
    outflows. We employ a total return investment approach whereby a
    mix of equity and fixed income investments are used to maximize
    the long-term return of plan assets for what we consider a
    prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to
    minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over
    the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful
    consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and our
    financial condition. The investment portfolio contains a
    diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
    Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S and

non-U.S. stocks

as well as growth, value, and small and large capitalizations.
    Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient
    and timely manner. However, derivatives may not be used to
    leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying
    investments. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an
    ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic
    asset and liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio
    reviews.

BFI Post
    Retirement Healthcare Plan

We acquired obligations under the BFI Post Retirement Healthcare
    Plan as part of our acquisition of Allied. This plan provides
    continued medical coverage for certain former employees
    following their retirement, including some employees subject to
    collective bargaining agreements. Eligibility for this plan is
    limited to certain of those employees who had ten or more years
    of service and were age 55 or older as of December 31,
    1998, and certain employees in California who were hired on or
    before December 31, 2005 and who retire on or after
    age 55 with at least thirty years of service. Liabilities
    acquired for this plan were $1.2 million and
    $1.3 million, respectively, at the acquisition date and at
    December 31, 2008.

Multi-Employer
    Pension Plans

We contribute to 25 multi-employer pension plans under
    collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented
    employees. We acquired responsibility for contributions for a
    portion of these plans as part of our acquisition of Allied.
    Approximately 22% of our total current employees are
    participants in such multi-employer plans. These plans generally
    provide retirement benefits to participants based on their
    service to contributing employers. We do not administer these
    multi-employer plans. In general, these plans are managed by a
    board of trustees with the unions appointing certain trustees
    and other contributing employers of the plan appointing certain
    members. We generally are not represented on the board of
    trustees.

We do not have current plan financial information from the
    plans’ administrators, but based on the information
    available to us, it is possible that some of the multi-employer
    plans to which we contribute may be underfunded. The Pension
    Protection Act, enacted in August 2006, requires underfunded
    pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed
    intervals based on the level of their underfunding. Until the
    plan trustees develop the funding improvement plans or
    rehabilitation plans as required by the Pension Protection Act,
    we are unable to determine the amount of assessments we may be
    subject to, if any. Accordingly, we cannot determine at this
    time the impact that the Pension Protection Act may have on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Furthermore, under current law regarding multi-employer benefit
    plans, a plan’s termination, our voluntary withdrawal, or
    the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any
    under-funded, multi-employer pension plan would require us to
    make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the
    multi-employer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities. It is
    possible that there may be a mass withdrawal of employers
    contributing to these plans or plans may terminate in the near
    future. We could have adjustments to our estimates for these
    matters in the near term that could have a material effect on
    our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Our pension expense for multi-employer plans was
    $21.8 million, $18.9 million and $17.3 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plan

In conjunction with our merger with Allied, we acquired the
    obligations of Allied’s Supplemental Executive Retirement
    Plan (SERP), which provides retirement benefits to certain of
    Allied’s employees and former employees. SERP participants
    whose employment with us has been severed as a result of the
    merger will receive cash settlements six months following their
    respective separation dates. Benefits for SERP participants who
    remain with Republic were frozen as of the effective date of the
    merger. However, these active participants will continue to
    accrue interest credits at the annual rate of 6.0% until they
    are eligible for retirement. SERP participants who retired prior
    to the acquisition will continue to receive their benefits in
    accordance with the original plan provisions which allow for a
    maximum of ten years of retirement benefits equal to 60% of each
    participant’s respective average base salary during the
    three consecutive full calendar years of employment immediately
    preceding their date of retirement. At December 31, 2008,
    there were one retired and three active participants in the plan.

We acquired SERP liabilities totaling $13.6 million as of
    the acquisition date. Changes in the SERP’s projected
    benefit obligation and the fair value of its assets from
    December 5 through December 31, 2008 are as follows (in

    equal to 100% of the first 3% of eligible compensation and 50%
    of the next 2% of eligible compensation contributed by each
    employee, which is funded in cash. All contributions vest
    immediately.

In conjunction with the merger with Allied, we acquired the
    Allied 401(k) Plan, which will be merged into the 401(k) Plan
    effective July 1, 2009. Participants in the Allied 401(k)
    Plan are eligible for the same employer matching contribution as
    those under the 401(k) Plan effective January 1, 2009.

Total expense recorded for the matching 401(k) contribution in
    2008, 2007 and 2006 was $16.8 million, $10.9 million
    and $10.1 million, respectively.

Incentive
    Compensation Plans

Our compensation program includes a management incentive plan,
    which uses certain performance metrics such as free cash flow,
    targeted earnings and return on invested capital to measure
    performance. In addition, in connection with our merger with
    Allied, our Board of Directors has approved an integration bonus
    plan that provides compensation that depends on our achieving
    targeted synergies of approximately $150.0 million by the
    end of 2010. Incentive awards are payable in cash.

EARNINGS PER

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares (including
    restricted stock and vested but unissued deferred stock units)
    outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is
    based on the combined weighted average number of common shares
    and common share equivalents outstanding which include, where
    appropriate, the assumed exercise of employee stock options and
    unvested restricted stock awards. In computing diluted earnings
    per share, we utilize the treasury stock method.

Fuel
    Hedges

We have entered into multiple option agreements related to
    forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under SFAS 133, the
    options qualified for, and were designated as, effective hedges
    of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases
    (fuel hedges).

If the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon
    of diesel fuel (average price) as published by the Department of
    Energy exceeds the contract price per gallon, we receive the
    difference between the average price and the contract price
    (multiplied by the notional gallons) from the counter-party. If
    the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of
    diesel fuel is less than the contract price per gallon, we pay
    the difference to the counter-party.

The fair values of the fuel hedges are obtained from third-party
    counter-parties and are determined using standard option
    valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being
    based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in
    the fair value hierarchy). The aggregated fair values of the
    outstanding fuel hedges at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were
    $11.7 million and $11.4 million, respectively, and
    have been recorded in other current liabilities and other
    current assets in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively.

In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portions of the
    changes in fair values as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    net of tax, of $7.1 million and $6.9 million,
    respectively, have been recorded in stockholders’

    The ineffective portions of the changes in fair values as of
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were immaterial and have
    been recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated
    statements of income. Realized gains of $5.9 million and
    realized losses of $1.6 million and $1.3 million
    related to these fuel hedges are included in cost of operations
    in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Commodity
    Hedges

We have entered into multiple agreements related to certain

If the price per short ton of the hedging instrument (average
    price) as reported on the Official Board Market is less than the
    contract price per short ton, we receive the difference between
    the average price and the contract price (multiplied by the
    notional short tons) from the counter-party. If the price of the
    commodity exceeds the contract price per short ton, we pay the
    difference to the counter-party.

The fair values of the commodity hedges are obtained from a
    third-party counter-party and are determined using standard
    option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices
    being based on those observed in underlying markets
    (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). The aggregated fair
    value of the outstanding commodity hedges at December 31,
    2008 was an asset of $8.8 million, and has been recorded in
    other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portions of the
    change in fair value as of December 31, 2008, net of tax,
    of $5.3 million, have been recorded in stockholders’
    equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income.
    The ineffective portion of the change in fair value as of
    December 31, 2008 was immaterial, and has been recorded in
    other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of
    income.

Fair Value
    Measurements

SFAS 157 provides a framework for measuring fair value and
    establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
    used to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to
    unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to
    unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs).

We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In measuring
    the fair value of our assets and liabilities, we use market data
    or



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

assumptions that we believe market participants would use in
    pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk
    when appropriate. As of December 31, 2008, our assets and
    liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
    include the following (in millions):

    Plans

In conjunction with the acquisition of Allied, we acquired
    various defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare
    plans. The change in the funded status of these plans of
    $3.6 million, net of tax, from the acquisition date through
    the plans’ measurement date are the result of changes in
    the discount rate and the plans’ asset values, and have
    been reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income at
    December 31, 2008.

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

We are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations
    and have implemented our own safeguards to respond to regulatory
    requirements. In the normal course of conducting our operations,
    we may become involved in certain legal and administrative
    proceedings. Some of these actions may result in fines,
    penalties or judgments against us, which may impact earnings and
    cash flows for a particular period. We accrue for legal matters
    and regulatory compliance contingencies when such costs are
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. Although the ultimate
    outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty,
    except as described below or in Note 10

, Income
    Taxes

, in the discussion of our outstanding tax dispute with
    the IRS or as indicated otherwise below, we do not believe that
    the outcome of our pending legal and administrative proceedings
    will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Countywide
    Matter

On March 26, 2007, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
    (OEPA) issued Final Findings and Orders (F&Os) to Republic
    Services of Ohio II, LLC (Republic-Ohio), an Ohio limited
    liability company and our wholly owned subsidiary. The F&Os
    relate to environmental conditions attributed to a chemical
    reaction resulting from the disposal of certain aluminum
    production waste at the Countywide Recycling and Disposal
    facility (Countywide) in East Sparta, Ohio. The F&Os, and
    certain other remedial actions Republic-Ohio agreed with the
    OEPA to undertake to address the environmental conditions,
    include, without limitation, the following actions:
    (a) prohibiting leachate recirculation, (b) refraining
    from the disposal of solid waste in certain portions of the
    site, (c) updating engineering plans and specifications and
    providing further information regarding the integrity of various
    engineered components at the site, (d) performing
    additional data collection, (e) taking additional measures
    to address emissions, (f) expanding the gas collection and
    control system, (g) installing a “fire” break,
    (h) removing liquids



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

from gas extraction wells, and (i) submitting a plan to the
    OEPA to suppress the chemical reaction and, following approval
    by the OEPA, implementing such plan. We also paid approximately
    $.7 million in sanctions to comply with the F&Os
    during the three months ended March 31, 2007. Republic-Ohio
    has performed certain interim remedial actions required by the
    OEPA, but the OEPA has not approved Republic-Ohio’s plan to
    suppress the chemical reaction.

Republic-Ohio received additional orders from the OEPA requiring
    certain actions to be taken by Republic-Ohio, including
    additional air quality monitoring and the installation and
    continued maintenance of gas well dewatering systems.
    Republic-Ohio has also entered into an Agreed Order on Consent
    (AOC) with the EPA requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred
    by the EPA and requiring Republic-Ohio to (a) design and
    install a temperature and gas monitoring system, (b) design
    and install a composite cap or cover, and (c) develop and
    implement an air monitoring program. The AOC became effective on
    April 17, 2008 and Republic-Ohio has complied with the
    terms of the AOC. Republic-Ohio also is in the process of
    constructing an additional “fire” break under the
    authority and supervision of the EPA.

We had learned that the Commissioner of the Stark County Health
    Department (Commission) recommended that the Stark County Board
    of Health (Board of Health) suspend Countywide’s 2007
    annual operating license. We had also learned that the
    Commissioner intended to recommend that the Board of Health deny
    Countywide’s license application for 2008. Republic-Ohio
    obtained a preliminary injunction on November 28, 2007
    prohibiting the Board of Health from suspending its 2007
    operating license. Republic-Ohio also obtained a preliminary
    injunction on February 15, 2008 prohibiting the Board of
    Health from denying its 2008 operating license application. The
    litigation with the Board of Health is pending in the Stark
    County Court of Common Pleas. We and the Board of Health have
    been participating in discussions regarding facility licensing
    that have resulted in an agreement whereby Republic-Ohio will
    secure its operating license and pay $10.0 million to
    resolve the issues at Countywide. The specific terms of the
    agreement are being finalized.

We believe that we have performed or are diligently performing
    all actions required under the F&Os and the AOC and that
    Countywide does not pose a threat to the environment.
    Additionally, we believe that we satisfy the rules and
    regulations that govern the operating license at Countywide.

We are vigorously pursuing financial contributions from third
    parties for our costs to comply with the F&Os and the other
    required remedial actions.

In a suit filed on October 8, 2008 in the Tuscarawas County
    Ohio Court of Common Pleas, approximately 700 plaintiffs have
    named Republic Services, Inc. and Republic-Ohio as defendants.
    The claims alleged are negligence and nuisance and arise from
    the operation of Countywide. Republic-Ohio has owned and
    operated Countywide since February 1, 1999. Waste
    Management, Inc. and Waste Management Ohio, Inc., previous
    owners and operators of Countywide, have been named as
    defendants as well. Plaintiffs are individuals and businesses
    located in the geographic area around Countywide. They claim
    that due to the acceptance of a specific waste stream and
    operational issues and conditions, the landfill has generated
    odors and other unsafe emissions which have allegedly impaired
    the use and value of their property. There are also allegations
    that the emissions from the landfill may have adverse health
    effects. The relief requested includes compensatory damages,
    punitive damages, costs for medical monitoring and screening,
    interest on damages, costs and disbursements, and reasonable
    attorney and expert witness fees. We intend to vigorously defend
    against the plaintiffs’ allegations.

Sunrise
    Matter

On August 1, 2008, Republic Services of Southern Nevada,
    our wholly owned subsidiary, signed a Consent Decree with the
    EPA, the Bureau of Land Management and Clark County, Nevada
    related to the Sunrise Landfill. Under the Consent Decree, RSSN
    has agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Sunrise Landfill for which RSSN and Clark County were otherwise
    jointly and severally liable. We also paid $1.0 million in
    sanctions related to the Consent Decree. RSSN is currently
    working with the Clark County Staff and Board of Commissioners
    to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the
    Consent Decree. However, we have not recorded any potential
    recoveries.

It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the
    environmental remediation liabilities recorded to reflect the
    effects of new or additional information, to the extent that
    such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the
    required actions. Future changes in our estimates of the costs,
    timing or duration of the required actions could have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

Luri
    Matter

On August 17, 2007, a lawsuit was filed against us and
    certain of our subsidiaries relating to an alleged retaliation
    claim by a former employee, Ronald Luri v. Republic
    Services, Inc., Republic Services of Ohio Hauling LLC, Republic
    Services of Ohio I LLC, Jim Bowen and Ron Krall in the Cuyahoga
    County Common Pleas Court in Ohio. On July 3, 2008, a jury
    verdict was awarded against us in the amount of
    $46.6 million, including $43.1 million in punitive
    damages. On September 24, 2008, the Court awarded
    pre-judgement interest of $.3 million and attorney fees and
    litigation costs of $1.1 million. Post-judgement interest is
    presently accruing at a rate of 8% for 2008 and 5% for 2009.
    Management anticipates that post-judgement interest could accrue
    through the middle of 2010 for a total of $5.4 million.
    Post-judgment motions filed on our behalf and certain of our
    subsidiaries were denied, and on October 1, 2008, we filed
    a notice of appeal. It is reasonably possible that a final,
    non-appealable judgment of liability for compensatory and
    punitive damages may be assessed against us related to this
    matter. Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate
    outcome, management believes that the amount of any final,
    non-appealable judgment will not be material.

Forward
    Matter

On November 23, 2005, Allied received a letter from the
    San Joaquin District Attorney’s Office, Environmental
    Prosecutions Unit (the District Attorney), alleging violations
    of California permit and regulatory requirements relating to
    Forward, Inc. (Forward), its wholly owned subsidiary, and the
    operation of this landfill. The District Attorney is
    investigating whether Forward may have (i) mixed green
    waste with food waste as “alternative daily cover,”
    (ii) exceeded the daily and weekly tonnage intake limits,
    (iii) allowed a concentration of methane gas well in excess
    of five percent, or (iv) accepted hazardous waste at a
    landfill which is not authorized to accept hazardous waste. Such
    conduct allegedly violates provisions of Business and
    Professions Code sections 17200, et seq., by virtue of
    violations of Public Resources Code Division 30,
    Part 4, Chapter 3, Article 1, sections 44004
    and 44014(b); California Code of Regulations Title 27,
    Chapter 3, Subchapter 4, Article 6,
    sections 20690(11) and 20919.5; and Health and Safety Code
    sections 25200, 25100, et seq, and 25500, et seq. On
    December 7, 2006, Forward received a subpoena and
    interrogatories from the District Attorney and responded to both
    as of February 15, 2007. On October 1, 2008, the
    District Attorney served suit against Allied alleging violations
    of the California Business and Professional Code
    sections 17200, et seq. and is seeking monetary sanctions
    of up to $2,500 per violation and a permanent injunction to obey
    all applicable laws and regulations. We intend to vigorously
    defend the allegations.

Sycamore
    Matter

On July 10, 2008, the State of West Virginia Department of
    Environmental Protection filed suit against Allied’s
    subsidiary Allied Waste Sycamore Landfill, LLC (Sycamore
    Landfill) in Putnam County Circuit Court alleging thirty-eight
    violations of the Solid Waste Management Act, W. Va. Code sec.

22-15-1

et
    seq,

    seq, and the Groundwater Protection Act, W. Va. Code sec.

22-12-1

et
    seq (collectively, the Applicable Statues) between January 2007
    and August 2007. The State of West Virginia is seeking
    injunctive relief requiring the Sycamore Landfill to comply with
    the Applicable Statues as well to eliminate all common law
    public nuisances, and is seeking monetary sanctions of up to
    $25,000 per day for each violation. We are currently negotiating
    a settlement with the State which we believe will include
    monetary sanctions below $200,000.

20 Atlantic
    Avenue Matter

On October 3, 2008, a jury in federal district court in
    Boston, Massachusetts, returned a verdict in favor of the
    plaintiff and against the defendant, Allied, in a breach of
    contract action. The jury concluded that, between 1997 and 2002,
    Allied had failed to deliver as much fiber recyclables as
    required under a contract, and the jury stated that damages were
    approximately $10.4 million. Under applicable law,
    prejudgment interest of 12% per year (approximately
    $10.5 million through December 31, 2008) is
    automatically added to the verdict amount when judgment is
    entered by the court. The jury verdict did not address all the
    claims pending in the lawsuit. A hearing before the judge on
    some of the remaining claims was scheduled to begin
    January 6, 2009. On January 5, 2009, the parties
    reached a settlement in which all claims in the lawsuit will be
    dismissed in exchange for a payment of $18.0 million from
    us to the plaintiff, which we have recorded as a liability as of
    December 31, 2008. The payment will be made in three
    installments during the first three quarters of 2009 and the
    second and third installments will bear interest at 3% per annum.

Carter Valley
    Matter

On April 12, 2006, federal agents executed a search warrant
    at BFI Waste Systems of Tennessee, LLC’s Carter Valley
    Landfill (the Landfill) and seized information regarding the
    Landfill’s receipt of special waste from one of its
    commercial customers. On the same date, the
    U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of
    Tennessee served a grand jury subpoena on Allied seeking related
    documents (the 2006 Subpoena). Shortly thereafter, the
    government agreed to an indefinite extension of the time to
    respond to the subpoena, and there were no further
    communications between Allied and the federal government until
    2008. In 2007, while the federal investigation was pending, the
    Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
    investigated the Landfill’s receipt of the same special
    waste, determined that there was not a sufficient basis to
    conclude that the Landfill had disposed of hazardous waste, and
    took no enforcement action. On April 2, 2008, the US
    Attorney’s Office issued a new grand jury subpoena seeking
    the same categories of documents requested in the 2006 Subpoena.
    We are currently producing documents in response to the 2008
    subpoena. On January 21, 2009, the DOJ sent a letter to us
    stating that it believed, based on its initial investigation,
    that certain unnamed employees at the Landfill had violated the
    RCRA and that we were liable for these criminal violations under
    the theory of

respondeat superior

. If convicted, pursuant
    to applicable law, we could be subject to a wide range of
    criminal or civil penalties. Criminal penalties are limited to
    the greater of a maximum of $50,000 for each day of violation, a
    calculation of twice the gross pecuniary gain from the offense
    or a maximum of $500,000. We could also be subject to civil
    penalties of $32,500 per day per violation. We intend to meet
    with the DOJ as soon as practicable to discuss the
    government’s investigation and understand the basis for the
    government’s belief that our employees violated RCRA.

Litigation
    Related to the Merger with Allied

On July 25, 2008, a putative class action was filed, and on
    August 15, 2008 was amended, in the Court of Chancery of
    the State of Delaware by the New Jersey Carpenters Pension and
    the New Jersey Carpenters Annuity Funds against us and the
    members of our Board of Directors, individually.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On August 21, 2008, a second putative class action was
    filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by David
    Shade against us, the members of Republic’s Board of
    Directors, individually, and Allied. On September 22, 2008,
    the New Jersey Carpenters and the Shade cases were consolidated
    by the Court of Chancery, and on September 24, 2008, the
    plaintiffs in the Delaware case, now known as In Re: Republic
    Services Inc. Shareholders Litigation, filed a verified
    consolidated amended class action complaint in the Court of
    Chancery of the State of Delaware.

On September 5, 2008, a putative class action was filed in
    the Circuit Court in and for Broward County, Florida, by the
    Teamsters Local 456 Annuity Fund against us and the members of
    Republic’s Board of Directors, individually.

Both the Delaware consolidated action and the Florida action
    were brought on behalf of a purported class of our stockholders
    and primarily sought, among other things, to enjoin the proposed
    transaction between Republic and Allied, as well as damages and
    attorneys’ fees. The actions also sought to compel us to
    accept the unsolicited proposals made by Waste Management, Inc.
    (Waste), or at least compel our Board of Directors to further
    consider and evaluate the Waste proposals, which proposals were
    subsequently withdrawn.

On September 24, 2008, the defendants in the Florida
    litigation filed a motion to stay or to dismiss the lawsuit in
    light of the consolidated Delaware class action.

On October 17, 2008, plaintiffs in the consolidated
    Delaware action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction
    seeking to require the defendants to make certain additional
    disclosures prior to the shareholder vote on the merger.

On October 29, 2008, the defendants entered into a
    memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs regarding the
    settlement of the Delaware and Florida actions. As part of this
    memorandum of understanding, we agreed to make certain
    additional disclosures to our stockholders and such disclosures
    were made by us in our Current Report on

Form 8-K

filed with the SEC on October 30, 2008. As of
    January 16, 2009, following completion of certain
    confirmatory discovery by counsel to plaintiffs, the parties
    executed a stipulation of settlement. The stipulation of
    settlement is subject to customary conditions, including court
    approval following notice to our stockholders. The stipulation
    of settlement provides that a hearing will be scheduled at which
    the court will consider the fairness, reasonableness and
    adequacy of the settlement which, if finally approved by the
    court, will resolve all of the claims that were or could have
    been brought in the actions being settled, including all claims
    relating to the merger transaction, the merger agreement, our
    rejections of the unsolicited Waste proposals, and any
    disclosures made in connection therewith. The stipulation of
    settlement also provides that plaintiffs’ counsel may
    petition the court for an award of attorneys’ fees and
    expenses to be paid by us. On February 20, 2009, the court
    preliminarily approved the settlement agreed to in the
    stipulation and set a final hearing to consider the fairness of
    the settlement for May 19, 2009. There can be no assurance
    that the court will approve the settlement agreed to in the
    stipulation of settlement. In such event, the settlement may be
    terminated.

On December 3, 2008, the DOJ and seven state attorneys
    general filed a complaint, Hold Separate Stipulation and Order,
    and competitive impact statement, together with a proposed final
    judgment, in the United States District Court for the District
    of Columbia, in connection with approval under the HSR Act of
    our merger with Allied. The court entered the Hold Separate
    Stipulation and Order on December 4, 2008, which terminated
    the waiting period under the HSR Act and allowed the parties to
    close the transaction subject to the conditions described in the
    Hold Separate Stipulation and Order. These conditions include
    the divestiture of certain assets. However, the final judgment
    can only be approved by the court after the DOJ publishes a
    notice in the Federal Register and considers comments it
    receives. During this period, if the DOJ believes that the final
    judgment is no longer in the public interest, the DOJ may
    withdraw its



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

support of the final judgment and seek to prevent the final
    judgment from becoming final in its present form. Likewise, the
    court may, in its discretion, modify the divestitures or other
    relief sought by the DOJ if the court believes that such
    modification is in the public interest. The precise timing for
    the confirmation of the final judgment is not known. Management
    believes that the court will enter the final judgment and that
    modifications to the final judgment, if any, will not be
    material.

Lease
    Commitments

We and our subsidiaries lease real property, equipment and
    software under various operating leases with terms from one
    month to twenty years. Rent expense during the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $19.3 million,

Restricted Cash
    and Other Financial Guarantees

We are required to provide financial assurance to governmental
    agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable
    environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations
    for capping, closure and post-closure costs, and our performance
    under certain collection, landfill and transfer station
    contracts. We satisfy the financial assurance requirements by
    providing surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies or
    trust deposits. The amount of the financial assurance
    requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs is
    determined by applicable state environmental regulations, which
    vary by state. The financial assurance requirements for capping,
    closure and post-closure costs can either be for costs
    associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire
    landfill. Generally, states will require a third-party
    engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping,
    closure and post-closure costs that are used to determine the
    required amount of financial assurance for a landfill. The
    amount of financial assurance required can, and generally will,
    differ from the obligation determined and recorded under GAAP.
    The amount of the financial assurance requirements related to
    contract performance varies by contract. Additionally, we are
    required to provide financial assurance for our self-insurance
    program and collateral for certain performance obligations.

We had the following financial instruments and collateral in
    place to secure our financial assurances at December 31,
    (in millions):

These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of
    business and are not debt. Since we currently have no liability
    for this financial assurance, it is not reflected in our
    consolidated balance sheets. However, we have recorded capping,
    closure and post-closure obligations and self-insurance reserves
    as they are incurred. The underlying financial assurance
    obligations, in excess of those already reflected in our
    consolidated balance sheets, would be recorded if it is probable
    that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations. We
    do not expect this to occur.

Our restricted cash deposits include, among other things,
    restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt
    facilities, and restricted cash pledged to regulatory agencies
    and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our
    performance related to our final capping, closure and

Guarantees

We enter into contracts in the normal course of business that
    include indemnification clauses. Indemnifications relating to
    known liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial
    statements based on our best estimate of required future
    payments. Certain of these indemnifications relate to contingent
    events or occurrences, such as the imposition of additional
    taxes due to a change in the tax law or adverse interpretation
    of the tax law, and indemnifications made in divestiture
    agreements where we indemnify the buyer for liabilities that
    relate to our activities prior to the divestiture and that may
    become known in the future. We do not believe that these
    contingent obligations will have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

We have entered into agreements with property owners to
    guarantee the value of certain property that is adjacent to
    certain of our landfills. These agreements have varying terms.
    These agreements are accounted for in accordance with
    FIN 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
    Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
    Indebtedness of Others.

We do not believe that these
    contingent obligations will have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Other
    Matters

Our business activities are conducted in the context of a
    developing and changing statutory and regulatory framework.
    Governmental regulation of the waste management industry
    requires us to obtain and retain numerous governmental permits
    to conduct various aspects of our operations. These permits are
    subject to revocation, modification or denial. The costs and
    other capital expenditures which may be required to obtain or
    retain the applicable permits or comply with applicable
    regulations could be significant. Any revocation, modification
    or denial of permits could have a material adverse effect on us.

We are subject to various federal, state and local tax rules and
    regulations. Our compliance with such rules and regulations is
    periodically audited by tax authorities. These authorities may
    challenge the positions taken in our tax filings. As such, to
    provide for certain potential tax exposures, we maintain
    liabilities for uncertain tax positions for our estimate of the
    final outcome of the examinations. For further information
    related to our liabilities for uncertain tax positions, see
    Note 10,

Income Taxes

.

We believe that the liabilities we have for uncertain tax
    positions recorded are adequate. However, a significant
    assessment against us in excess of the liabilities recorded
    could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON REPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.’S INTERNAL CONTROL
    OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We, as members of management of Republic Services, Inc. are
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
    Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
    management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable
    assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that
    could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control
    systems and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of
    the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
    of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
    issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

We excluded from our assessment of our effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting the
    internal controls of Allied Waste Industries, Inc. (Allied),
    which was acquired by us on December 5, 2008. Allied is
    included in the 2008 consolidated financial statements of
    Republic Services, Inc, and constituted $15,460.7 million
    and $(14.9) million of total assets and net assets,
    respectively, as of December 31, 2008, and $463.7 million
    and $(11.3) million of revenue and net income, respectively, for
    the year then ended. We will include the internal controls of
    Allied in our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting for 2009.

We, under the supervision of and with the participation of our
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
    Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, assessed the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria for effective
    internal control over financial reporting described in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, we concluded that
    we maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the specified
    criteria.

Our internal control over financial reporting has been audited
    by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is
    included herein.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(e),

and

15d-15(e))

as of the end of the



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon that
    evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective as of the end of the period covered by this
    Annual Report.

Changes in
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Based on an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, there has been no change in
    our internal control over financial reporting during our last
    fiscal quarter identified in connection with that evaluation,
    that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
