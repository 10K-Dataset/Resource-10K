PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Overview

We are the second largest provider of services in the domestic
    non-hazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue. We
    provide non-hazardous solid waste collection services for
    commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers
    through 348 collection companies in 40 states and Puerto
    Rico. We own or operate 204 transfer stations, 193 active solid
    waste landfills and 76 recycling facilities. We also operate
    73 landfill gas and renewable energy projects. We were
    incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1996.

Based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications,
    we believe that the United States non-hazardous solid waste
    services industry generates annual revenue of approximately
    $54 billion, of which approximately 60% is generated by
    publicly owned waste companies. We believe that we and one other
    public waste company generated in excess of 60% of the publicly
    owned companies’ total revenue. Additionally, industry data
    indicates that the non-hazardous waste industry in the United
    States remains fragmented as privately held companies and
    municipal and other local governmental authorities generate
    approximately 17% and 23%, respectively, of total industry
    revenue. In general, growth in the solid waste industry is
    linked to growth in the overall economy, including the level of
    new household and business formation and changes in residential
    and commercial construction activity.

Our operations are national in scope, but the physical
    collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business;
    therefore, the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our
    markets. By combining local operating management with
    standardized business practices, we can drive greater overall
    operating efficiency across the company, while maintaining

day-to-day

operating decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.
    We implement this strategy through an organizational structure
    that groups our operations within a corporate, region and area
    structure. We manage our operations through four geographic
    operating segments which are also our reportable segments:
    Eastern, Midwestern, Southern and Western. The boundaries of our
    operating segments may change from time to time. Each of our
    regions is organized into several operating areas and each area
    contains multiple operating locations. Each of our regions and
    substantially all our areas provide collection, transfer,
    recycling and disposal services. We believe this structure
    facilitates the integration of our operations within each
    region, which is a critical component of our operating strategy.
    It also allows us to maximize the growth opportunities in each
    of our markets and to operate the business efficiently, while
    maintaining effective controls and standards over operational
    and administrative matters, including financial reporting. See
    Note 14,

Segment Reporting,

to our consolidated
    financial statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for further discussion of our operating segments.

On December 5, 2008, we acquired all the issued and
    outstanding shares of Allied Waste Industries, Inc. (Allied) in
    a

stock-for-stock

transaction for an aggregate purchase price of
    $12.1 billion, which included $5.4 billion of debt, at
    fair value. The acquisition created a company with a strong,
    national operating platform. The foundation of this platform is
    our large network of disposal sites, which provides us with a
    far stronger vertically integrated operating structure than
    either company would have been able to achieve on its own. We
    believe that our improved vertically integrated operations will
    be a key driver of our future profitability.

We had revenue of $8.1 billion, $8.2 billion and
    $3.7 billion and operating income of $1.5 billion,
    $1.6 billion and $0.3 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition
    to the Allied acquisition, a number of items impacted our 2010,
    2009 and 2008 financial results. For a description of these
    items, see Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Overview and Consolidated Results of
    Operations,

included elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.



During the past several years, we supported our internal growth
    strategy with our presence in markets with higher than average
    population growth. We believe our presence in these markets
    positions us to experience growth at rates that are generally
    higher than those of declining population growth.

We continue to focus on enhancing stockholder value by
    implementing our operating and financial strategies. To ensure
    that our goals relative to these strategies are achieved, we
    have developed and implemented incentive programs that help
    focus our entire company on realizing key performance metrics,
    including increasing free cash flow, achieving targeted
    earnings, maintaining and improving returns on invested capital,
    and maintaining the integration synergies we have achieved. Our
    operating and financial strategies are described further herein.

Operating
    Strategy

We seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to
    increase operating margins and enhance stockholder value. Our
    operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the
    following:

•

using the extensive industry knowledge and experience of our
    executive management team,

•

using a decentralized management structure in overseeing

day-to-day

operations,

•

using our strong, integrated operating platform, and

•

implementing major initiatives aimed at improving the quality of
    our service and our operating margins.

Experienced
    Executive Management Team

We believe that we have one of the most experienced executive
    management teams in the solid waste industry.

Donald W. Slager became our CEO and remained our President on
    January 1, 2011, after having served as our President and
    Chief Operating Officer (COO) from the Allied acquisition in
    December 2008 until then. Prior to the acquisition,
    Mr. Slager worked for Allied from 1992 through 2008 and
    served in various management positions, including President and
    COO from 2004 through 2008 and Executive Vice President and COO
    from 2003 to 2004. From 2001 to 2003, Mr. Slager served as
    Senior Vice President, Operations. Mr. Slager held various
    management positions at Allied from 1992 to 2003, and was
    previously General Manager at National Waste Services, where he
    served in various management positions since 1985.
    Mr. Slager has over 30 years of experience in the
    solid waste industry. Mr. Slager has been a member of our
    Board of Directors since June 24, 2010.

Tod C. Holmes has served as our Chief Financial Officer since
    August 1998. Mr. Holmes served as our Vice President of
    Finance from June 1998 until August 1998 and as Vice President
    of Finance of our former parent company’s Solid Waste Group
    from January 1998 until June 1998. From 1987 to 1998,
    Mr. Holmes served in various management positions with
    Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc., including Vice President,
    Investor Relations from 1996 to 1998, Divisional Vice President,
    Collection Operations from 1995 to 1996, Divisional Vice
    President and Regional Controller – Northern Region
    from 1993 to 1995, and Divisional Vice President and Assistant
    Corporate Controller from 1991 to 1993. Mr. Holmes has over
    23 years of experience in the solid waste industry.

Kevin Walbridge has served as our Executive Vice
    President – Operations since October 1, 2010.
    Mr. Walbridge served as our Senior Vice President of
    Midwestern Operations from December 2008 until then, and served
    as our Central Region Vice President from the time he joined us
    in 1997 through December 2008. Before joining us,
    Mr. Walbridge served as the Vice President
    Operations/Co-Owner of National Serv All from 1996 to 1997, the
    President of Waste Management of Alameda County from 1993 to
    1996, and the Division President of Empire Waste Management
    from 1985 to 1993. Mr. Walbridge has over 28 years of
    experience in the solid waste industry.

Michael P. Rissman has served as our Executive Vice President,
    General Counsel and Corporate Secretary since August 2009.
    Previously, Mr. Rissman had served as acting General
    Counsel and Corporate Secretary



from March 2009. Mr. Rissman joined Allied as Vice
    President and Deputy General Counsel in July 2007 and continued
    in the same positions at Republic following the Allied
    acquisition in December 2008. Prior to joining Allied,
    Mr. Rissman was a partner at Mayer, Brown, Rowe &
    Maw, LLP, in Chicago, where he worked from 1990 until coming to
    Allied in 2007.

Our regional senior vice presidents have an average of
    25 years of experience in the industry.

Decentralized
    Management Structure

We rely on a decentralized management structure to minimize
    administrative overhead costs and to more efficiently manage our

day-to-day

operations. Our local management has extensive industry
    experience in growing, operating and managing solid waste
    companies and has substantial experience in their local
    geographic markets, allowing us to quickly respond to and meet
    our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local
    businesses and municipalities. Each regional management team
    includes a senior vice president, vice president-controller,
    vice president of human resources, vice president of sales, vice
    president of operations support, director of safety, director of
    engineering and environmental management, and director of market
    planning and development. We believe that our strong regional
    management teams allow us to more effectively and efficiently
    drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the
    organization. Our regional management teams and area presidents
    have extensive authority, responsibility and autonomy for
    operations within their respective geographic markets.
    Compensation for area management teams is primarily based on
    improving operating income, free cash flow and return on
    invested capital generated in each manager’s geographic
    area of responsibility. In addition, through long-term incentive
    programs, including stock options, we believe we have achieved
    one of the lowest turnover levels in the industry for our local
    management teams. As a result of retaining experienced managers
    with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local
    communities, we are proactive in anticipating customers’
    needs and adjusting to changes in our markets. We also seek to
    implement the best practices of our various regions and areas
    throughout our operations to continue improving operating
    margins.

Strong,
    Integrated Operating Platform

We believe that with the Allied acquisition we have created a
    company with a strong, national operating platform. Most
    previous attempts to consolidate the waste industry focused on a
    “roll up” strategy often involving relatively young
    companies solely focused on increasing revenue through
    acquisitions. We believe that the combination of Republic’s
    and Allied’s mature and proven business practices has been
    a critical component of our success and has driven the
    realization of approximately $190 million in annual
    run-rate synergies since completion of the acquisition. During
    2011, we will continue to monitor the synergies we believe we
    have achieved and we will implement additional initiatives aimed
    at further improving operating margins.

Separate from acquisition related integration activities, we
    seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling
    waste streams from the point of collection through disposal. Our
    fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of
    operations and more favorable cash flows than our non-integrated
    markets. Through acquisitions, landfill operating agreements and
    other market development activities, we create market-specific,
    integrated operations typically consisting of one or more
    collection companies, transfer stations and landfills. We
    consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with
    significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels
    of waste volumes.

We also seek to acquire solid waste collection companies in
    markets in which we own or operate landfills. In addition, we
    generate internal growth in our disposal operations by
    developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills
    from time to time in markets in which we have significant
    collection operations or in markets that we determine lack
    sufficient disposal capacity. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, approximately 67%, 68%
    and 58%, respectively, of the total waste volume that we
    collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate
    (internalization). This increase in internalization from 2008 to
    2009 is due to a higher concentration of integrated hauling and
    landfill operations acquired in the Allied acquisition. In a
    number of our larger markets, we and our competitors are
    required to take waste to government-controlled disposal
    facilities (flow-control). This provides us with an opportunity
    to effectively



compete in these markets without investing in landfill capacity.
    By further integrating operations in existing markets, we may be
    able to reduce our disposal costs.

We continue to invest in integrating and expanding our
    information systems and technology platform. Our platform
    consists of the best of the legacy systems from both Republic
    and Allied. During 2009, we converted the entire company to a
    single payable and general ledger system. During 2010, we
    converted to a single operating system and we transitioned the
    entire company to a single payroll and human resource system.
    Our future technology related initiatives will include customer
    relationship management, billing, productivity and maintenance
    systems. We believe that the combination of these systems will
    prove to be a competitive advantage for our company.

Major
    Initiatives

During 2010, we believe we completed the most successful
    integration and consolidation of two major companies in the
    waste industry. The integration process allowed us to select the
    best tools and systems and to adopt the best practices of these
    two successful companies. During 2011, we will continue or begin
    to implement the following major initiatives aimed at improving
    profitability:

•

Safety.

Safety remains our highest priority for all
    of our employees and the communities we serve. Our long-standing
    commitment to safety is unwavering and is evident in our mission
    statement. We will continue to improve the driver safety
    training program and reward our people for operating in a safe
    and conscientious manner in all our lines of business.

•

Customer Experience.

We strive to provide the
    highest level of customer service. Our policy is to periodically
    visit each commercial account to ensure customer service and
    satisfaction. In addition to visiting existing customers, a
    salesperson develops a base of prospective customers within each
    market. We also have municipal marketing representatives that
    are responsible for working with each municipality or community
    to which we provide residential service to ensure customer
    satisfaction. Additionally, the municipal representatives
    organize and drive the effort to obtain new or renew municipal
    contracts in their service areas.

We will continue to reinvest in our existing fleet of vehicles,
    equipment, landfills and other facilities to ensure the highest
    level of service to our customers and the communities we serve.
    In addition, we continue to focus on innovative waste disposal
    processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals
    related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste
    practices. We believe that these in turn will help us achieve
    profitable growth.

During 2011, we will continue to exceed our customers’
    expectations through the consistent delivery of high quality
    service and an expanded use of technology to make it easier to
    do business with us. Our technology eventually will allow more
    customers to access information and perform functions like
    change service requests and make payments over the internet that
    were previously done with the assistance of a customer service
    representative. By increasing the ease of use and functionality
    of our web-based market presence, we believe we will enhance
    customer satisfaction and retention while we lower our costs.

•

Economies of Scale, Cost Efficiencies and Asset
    Utilization.

We continue to identify and implement best
    practices throughout our organization with the goal of
    permanently improving overall operating and financial results.
    These best practice initiatives focus on critical areas of our
    operations such as landfill operations, truck routing,
    recycling, maintenance and related service efficiencies,
    purchasing and administrative activities. The consolidation of
    acquired businesses into existing operations reduces costs by
    decreasing capital and expenses used for truck routing,
    personnel, equipment and vehicle maintenance, inventories and
    back-office administration. Generally, we consolidate our
    acquired administrative centers to reduce our general and
    administrative costs. Our goal is to maintain our selling,
    general and administrative costs at no more than 10.0% of
    revenue, which we believe is appropriate given our existing
    business platform.



In addition, our procurement initiatives ensure that we
    negotiate volume discounts for goods and services purchased.
    Further, we have taken steps to maximize the utilization of our
    assets. For example, to reduce the number of collection vehicles
    and maximize the efficiency of our fleet and drivers, we use a
    route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve
    operating density. Additionally, in 2011 we will continue to
    convert certain of our residential routes to single driver
    side-load service, thereby increasing employee safety and
    increasing route efficiency and service times. We continue to
    invest in our material recovery facilities by converting certain
    facilities from dual to single stream sorting and by updating
    our technology and equipment, all resulting in higher levels of
    productivity and recovered materials from a more efficient
    collection and recovery process. By using assets more
    efficiently, operating expenses can be reduced.

•

Targeted Profitable Growth.

Our growth strategy
    focuses on increasing revenue, gaining market share and
    enhancing stockholder value through internal growth in price and
    volume as well as acquisitions. Our internal growth strategy
    focuses on retaining existing customers and obtaining new
    commercial, municipal and industrial customers through our
    well-managed sales and marketing activities.

Price Growth.

We seek to secure price increases necessary
    to offset increased costs, to improve our operating margins and
    to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in
    assets such as our landfills.

Volume Growth.

Growth through increases in our customer
    base and services provided is the most capital efficient means
    for us to build our business. We seek to obtain long-term
    contracts for collecting solid waste in markets with growing
    populations. These include exclusive franchise agreements with
    municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts.
    By obtaining such long-term agreements, we have the opportunity
    to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the
    underlying population growth in these markets. We believe it is
    important to have secured exclusive, long-term franchise
    agreements in growing market areas. We believe that this
    positions us to experience internal growth rates that are
    generally higher than our industry’s overall growth rate.
    In addition, we believe that by securing a base of long-term
    recurring revenue in growing population markets, we are better
    able to protect our market position from competition and our
    business may be less susceptible to downturns in economic
    conditions. Volume growth includes not only expanding landfill
    and transfer station capacity and investing in trucks and
    containers, but also includes investing in information tools and
    training needed to ensure high productivity and quality service
    throughout all functional areas of our business. We work to
    increase collection and disposal volumes while ensuring that
    prices charged for such services provide an appropriate return
    on our capital investment.

Sales and Marketing Activities.

We seek to manage
    our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on
    our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate.
    We provide a National Accounts program in response to the needs
    of our national clients, centralizing services to effectively
    manage their needs, such as minimizing their procurement costs.
    We currently have approximately 1,100 sales and marketing
    employees in the field who are compensated using a commission
    structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality
    revenue. Generally, these employees directly solicit business
    from existing and new business from prospective commercial,
    industrial, municipal and residential customers. In training
    sales personnel we emphasize increased price and cost structures
    as well as the use of a customer relationship management system
    that assists in tracking sales opportunities. It also tracks
    renewal periods for potential commercial, industrial and
    franchise contracts. We believe our National Accounts program
    offers an opportunity for sales growth over the next several
    years.

Development Activities.

We seek to identify
    opportunities to further our position as an integrated service
    provider in markets where we are not fully integrated. Where
    appropriate, we seek to obtain permits to build transfer
    stations, recycling facilities, and landfills that would provide
    vertically integrated waste services or expand the service areas
    for our existing disposal sites. Development projects, while
    generally less capital intensive than acquisitions, typically
    require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to
    complete with no assurance of success. We undertake development



projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of
    success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities
    are not available.

Acquisition Growth.

Our acquisition growth strategy
    focuses primarily on privately held solid waste and recycling
    companies and the waste and recycling operations of municipal
    and other local governmental authorities that complement our
    existing business platform. We believe our ability to acquire
    privately held companies is enhanced by increasing competition
    in the solid waste industry, increasing capital requirements due
    to changes in solid waste regulatory requirements, and the
    limited number of exit strategies for privately held companies.
    We also seek to acquire operations and facilities from
    municipalities that are privatizing, as they seek to raise
    capital and reduce risk. In addition, we will continue to
    evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that
    are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies. Our
    acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on the following:

•

acquiring privately held businesses that position us for growth,

•

acquiring well-managed companies and, when appropriate,
    retaining local management, and

•

acquiring operations and facilities from municipalities that are
    privatizing and from publicly owned companies that are divesting
    of assets.

In addition, we have and may continue to exchange businesses
    with other solid waste companies if by doing so there is a net
    benefit to our business platform. These activities allow us to
    increase revenue and market share, lower our cost of operations
    as a percentage of revenue, and consolidate duplicative
    facilities and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and
    economies of scale.

•

Durability.

We believe our decentralized management
    structure provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing
    us to quickly respond to and meet customer’s needs and to
    stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities. However,
    functions such as fleet maintenance and customer service are
    areas where we believe we can continue to build durable,
    consistent processes across all operating divisions. Through
    standardization of core functions, we believe we can minimize
    variability in our maintenance facilities resulting in a safer
    fleet of vehicles and lower costs. By automating the collection
    process, we believe we can improve safety, increase productivity
    and reduce labor costs, thereby increasing operating margins.

For certain risks related to our operating strategy, see
    Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

Financial
    Strategy

Key components of our financial strategy include generating and
    growing free cash flow and sustaining or improving our return on
    invested capital. Our definition of free cash flow, which is not
    a measure determined in accordance with United States generally
    accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is cash
    provided by operating activities less purchases of property and
    equipment, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as
    presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We
    believe that free cash flow is a driver of stockholder value and
    provides useful information regarding the recurring cash
    provided by our operations. Free cash flow also demonstrates our
    ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes
    reinvesting in capital assets to ensure a high level of customer
    service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our
    customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment
    grade credit ratings and reducing debt, paying cash dividends,
    repurchasing our stock, and maintaining and improving our market
    position through business optimization. Free cash flow is also a
    key metric used to determine management’s compensation.

We manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital
    expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light
    of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely
    managing our working capital, which consists primarily of
    accounts receivable and accounts payable.



We have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize
    stockholder value as well as our return on invested capital. Our
    Financial Strategy includes:

Market
    Growth and Optimization

Within our markets, our goal is to deliver sustainable,
    long-term profitable growth while efficiently operating our
    assets to generate acceptable rates of return. We allocate
    capital to businesses, markets and development projects to
    support growth in order to achieve acceptable rates of return.
    We develop previously non-permitted, non-contiguous landfill
    sites (greenfield landfill sites). We also expand our existing
    landfill sites, when possible. We supplement this organic growth
    with acquisitions of operating assets, such as landfills,
    transfer stations, material recovery facilities and tuck-in
    acquisitions of collection and disposal operations in existing
    markets. We continuously evaluate our existing operating assets
    and their deployment within each market to determine if we have
    optimized our position and to ensure appropriate investment of
    capital. Where operations are not generating acceptable returns,
    we examine opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and
    returns through the integration of additional assets. If such
    enhancements are not possible, we may ultimately decide to
    divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other
    markets.

Enhancing
    Stockholder Value

•

Dividends.

In July 2003, our Board of Directors
    initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share. Our
    quarterly dividend has increased from time to time thereafter,
    the latest increase occurring in the third quarter of 2010 to
    $0.20 per share, representing a compound annual growth rate of
    approximately 26%. We expect to continue paying quarterly cash
    dividends and may consider additional increases of our quarterly
    cash dividend if we believe it will enhance stockholder value.

•

Share Repurchase.

In November 2010, our board of
    directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which
    we may repurchase up to $400.0 million of our outstanding
    shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2010, we used
    $41.1 million under the program to repurchase
    1.4 million shares at an average cost per share of $28.46.
    We expect to use the remaining funds in this program to
    repurchase shares during 2011. We intend to execute our
    financial strategy while still maintaining flexibility to take
    advantage of market growth opportunities and still maintaining
    our investment grade credit ratings.

Capital
    Structure

•

Debt.

Following our December 5, 2008 Allied
    acquisition, we initiated a debt reduction program which, to
    date, has resulted in a net reduction in borrowings of
    $1.3 billion funded by cash flow from operations and
    proceeds from disposition of assets. We also refinanced
    $1.5 billion in senior notes and $677.4 million in
    tax-exempt financings which reduced the average coupon rate on
    our senior notes and tax-exempt financings, on a weighted
    average basis, by more than 125 basis points while
    extending our debt maturities and thereby giving greater
    stability to our capital structure. We anticipate taking further
    advantage of capital market opportunities to mitigate our
    financial risk by issuing new debt in 2011 and using the
    proceeds to repay existing debt. Any early extinguishment of
    debt may result in a charge in the period in which the debt is
    repurchased and retired.

•

Credit Ratings.

We believe that a key component of
    our financial strategy includes maintaining investment grade
    ratings on our senior debt, which was rated BBB by
    Standard & Poor’s, BBB by Fitch and Baa3 by
    Moody’s as of December 31, 2010. Such ratings have
    allowed us, and should continue to allow us, to readily access
    capital markets at competitive rates. Our cash utilization
    strategy will continue to focus on maintaining our investment
    grade credit ratings.

For certain risks related to our financial strategy, see
    Item 1A.

Operations

Our operations primarily consist of the collection, transfer and
    disposal of non-hazardous solid waste.



Collection Services.

We provide solid waste
    collection services to commercial, industrial, municipal and
    residential customers through 348 collection companies. In 2010,
    76.2% of our revenue was derived from collection services.
    Within the collection line of business, 35% of our revenue is
    from services provided to municipal and residential customers,
    40% is from services provided to commercial customers, and 25%
    is from services provided to industrial and other customers.

Our residential collection operations involve the curbside
    collection of refuse from small containers into collection
    vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to
    landfills. Residential solid waste collection services are
    typically performed under contracts with municipalities, which
    we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us
    exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the
    respective municipalities. These contracts or franchises usually
    range in duration from one to five years, although some of our
    exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods.
    Residential solid waste collection services may also be
    performed on a subscription basis, in which individual
    households contract directly with us. The fees received for
    subscription residential collection are based primarily on
    market factors, frequency and type of service, the distance to
    the disposal facility and the cost of disposal. In general,
    subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in
    advance by the residential customers receiving the service.

In our commercial and industrial collection operations, we
    supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes. We
    also rent compactors to large waste generators. Commercial
    collection services are generally performed under one- to
    three-year service agreements, and fees are determined by
    considerations such as market factors, collection frequency,
    type of equipment furnished, the type and volume or weight of
    the waste collected, transportation costs, the distance to the
    disposal facility and the cost of disposal.

We also provide waste collection services to industrial and
    construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms
    ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer. Our
    construction services are provided to the commercial
    construction and home building sectors. We collect the
    containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to
    a landfill or a transfer station for disposal.

We also provide recycling services in certain markets. These
    services include the curbside collection of residential
    recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of recycling
    services to commercial and industrial customers.

Transfer and Disposal Services.

We own or operate
    204 transfer stations. We deposit waste at these transfer
    stations, as do other private haulers and municipal haulers, for
    compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal
    sites or recycling facilities. In 2010, transfer and disposal
    services accounted for 18.2% of our revenue.

As of December 31, 2010, we owned or operated 193 active
    landfills, which had approximately 36,000 permitted acres and
    total available permitted and probable expansion disposal
    capacity of approximately 4.7 billion in-place cubic yards.
    The in-place capacity of our landfills is subject to change
    based on engineering factors, requirements of regulatory
    authorities, our ability to continue to operate our landfills in
    compliance with applicable regulations, and our ability to
    successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion
    permits at our sites. Some of our landfills accept non-hazardous
    special waste, including utility ash, asbestos and contaminated
    soils.

Most of our active landfill sites have the potential for
    expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted
    acreage. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal
    capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue
    an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste
    volumes and prices, market needs, remaining capacity and
    likelihood of obtaining an expansion. To satisfy future disposal
    demand, we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at
    certain of our landfills. However, we cannot assure you that all
    proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed.

We also have responsibility for 129 closed landfills, for which
    we have associated closure and post-closure obligations.



Landfill Gas and Renewable Energy
    Projects.

During 2010, we brought two new landfill
    gas to energy (LFGTE) projects on line, resulting in a total of
    73 active LFGTE projects. These projects consist of the
    following:

•

51 electric plants fueled by landfill gas;

•

14 medium British Thermal Unit (BTU) plants providing landfill
    gas to industrial users to be burned as fuel;

•

six high BTU plants that provide pipeline quality natural gas
    that ultimately could be used to fuel our natural gas
    fleet, and

•

two projects that burn landfill gas to evaporate leachate.

The beneficial use of landfill gas provides our economy and
    environment with significant benefits, including:

•

The use and destruction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas,
    which reduces air pollution; and

•

The use of landfill gas offsets the use of fossil fuels, thus
    reducing our dependence on foreign oil and use of our natural
    resources.

Our 51 generating projects produce 321 megawatts of electricity
    annually, which is enough power to supply the electric needs of
    189,530 homes. Our 22 other LFGTE projects process and produce
    55,950 cubic feet per minute of landfill gas annually, which
    provides an energy benefit equivalent to heating 190,151 homes.
    The environmental benefit of all of our projects removes the
    equivalent of 950,434 tons of methane emissions and 2,346,535
    tons of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere. This is
    equivalent to removing the emissions of approximately
    3.9 million cars from our highways.

One of the two new projects, a medium BTU use project at our
    Newton County Landfill, received the USEPA 2010 Project of the
    Year award.

In 2010, we also began the design and construction of new
    projects at nine landfills, which is comprised of seven electric
    plants, one medium BTU plant and one high BTU plant. The high
    BTU project, announced in the fall of 2010, will feature an
    industry first process of producing high BTU pipeline quality
    gas and using that gas to provide equivalent renewable
    compressed natural gas (CNG) to a portion of our expanding fleet
    of CNG refuse vehicles.

Recycling Facilities and Other Services.

We
    own or operate 76 materials recovery facilities and other
    recycling operations. These facilities sort recyclable paper,
    aluminum, glass and other materials. Most of these recyclable
    materials are internally collected by our residential collection
    operations. In some areas, we receive commercial and industrial
    solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable
    materials and non-recyclable waste. The recyclable materials are
    salvaged, repackaged and sold to third parties, and the
    non-recyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators.

Sales and
    Marketing

We seek to provide quality services that will enable us to
    maintain high levels of customer satisfaction. Our business is
    derived from a broad customer base, which we believe will enable
    us to experience stable growth. We focus our marketing efforts
    on continuing and expanding our business with existing
    customers, as well as attracting new customers.

We employ approximately 1,100 sales and marketing employees with
    a sales and marketing strategy of providing high-quality,
    comprehensive solid waste collection, recycling, transfer and
    disposal services to our customers at competitive prices. We
    target customers of all sizes, from small quantity generators to
    large “Fortune 500” companies and municipalities.

While most of our marketing activity is local in nature, we also
    provide a National Accounts program in response to the needs of
    national and regional customers. This National Accounts program
    is designed to provide the best total solution to our
    customers’ evolving waste management needs in an
    environmentally responsible manner. We partner with national
    clients to reach their sustainability goals, optimize waste
    streams,



balance equipment and service intervals, and provide customized
    reporting. The National Accounts program centralizes services to
    effectively manage customer needs, while helping minimize
    procurement costs. With our extended geographic reach, this
    program effectively serves our customers nationwide. As industry
    leaders, our mission is to utilize our strengths and expertise
    to exceed customer expectations by consistently delivering the
    best national program available.

Historically we have not always changed the trade names of the
    local businesses we acquired, and therefore we do not operate
    nationally under any one mark or trade name. The majority of our
    operations, however, are branded under either
    “Republic,” “Allied” or “BFI.”

Customers

We provide services to a broad base of commercial, industrial,
    municipal and residential customers. No single customer has
    individually accounted for more than 3% of our consolidated
    revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last
    three years.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. However, entry into
    our business and the ability to operate profitably require
    substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience.

Competition in the non-hazardous solid waste industry comes from
    a few other large, national publicly owned companies, including
    Waste Management, Inc., several regional publicly and privately
    owned solid waste companies, and thousands of small privately
    owned companies. In any given market, competitors may have
    larger operations and greater resources. In addition to national
    and regional firms and numerous local companies, we compete with
    municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal
    operations. These municipalities may have financial advantages
    due to the availability of tax revenue and tax-exempt financing.

We compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of
    price and the quality of our services. From time to time, our
    competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort
    to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal
    contract. Our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain
    markets may be impacted by the pricing policies of our
    competitors. This may have an impact on our future revenue and
    profitability.

Seasonality
    and Severe Weather

Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement
    or severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste
    collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding
    compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste,
    reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or
    delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and
    other facilities. Our operations also can be favorably affected
    by severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste in
    situations where we are able to charge for our additional
    services.

Regulation

Our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of
    federal, state and local requirements that regulate the
    environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use.
    Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals
    generally are required for landfills and transfer stations,
    certain solid waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and
    other facilities that we own or operate. These permits are
    subject to denial, revocation, modification and renewal in
    certain circumstances. Federal, state and local laws and
    regulations vary, but generally govern wastewater or storm water
    discharges, air emissions, the handling, transportation,
    treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous
    waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with the
    release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These
    laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with
    strict powers of enforcement, which include the ability to
    revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits, obtain
    injunctions, or impose fines or penalties in the event of
    violations, including



criminal penalties. The U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) and various other federal, state and local
    authorities administer these regulations.

We strive to conduct our operations in compliance with
    applicable laws, regulations and permits. However, in the
    existing climate of heightened environmental concerns, from time
    to time we have been issued citations or notices from
    governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to
    expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various
    landfills and other facilities. We cannot assure you that
    citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite
    our regulatory compliance efforts. We have established final
    capping, closure, post-closure and remediation reserves that we
    believe, based on currently available information, will be
    adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs.
    However, we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed
    our reserves. Refer to the Contractual Obligations table within
    Item 7.

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”

contained elsewhere herein for further information.

Federal Regulation.

The following summarizes
    the primary federal environmental and occupational health and
    safety-related statutes that affect our facilities and
    operations:

•

The Solid Waste Disposal Act, including the Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act

(RCRA). RCRA establishes
    a framework for regulating the handling, transportation,
    treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous
    solid waste, and requires states to develop programs to ensure
    the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills.

Subtitle D of RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the
    disposal of municipal solid waste. Regulations under Subtitle D
    currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management
    criteria and guidelines, including location restrictions,
    facility design and operating criteria, final capping, closure
    and post-closure requirements, financial assurance standards,
    groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action
    standards. All of the states in which we operate have
    implemented permit programs pursuant to RCRA and Subtitle D.
    These state permit programs may include landfill requirements
    which are more stringent than those of Subtitle D. Our failure
    to comply with the implementation of federal environmental
    requirements by state and local authorities at any of our
    locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an
    operating permit, which would result in costs in connection with
    securing new permits and reduced revenue from lost operational
    time.

All of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill
    development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed
    Subtitle D requirements. Operating and design criteria for
    existing operations have been modified to comply with these
    regulations. Compliance with Subtitle D regulations has resulted
    in increased costs and may in the future require substantial
    additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally
    associated with our waste management activities.

•

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980

(CERCLA). CERCLA, among other things,
    provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release
    or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the
    environment. CERCLA may impose strict joint and several
    liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural
    resources upon current owners and operators of a site, parties
    who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous
    substances were disposed of, parties who transported the
    hazardous substances to a site, and parties who arranged for the
    disposal of the hazardous substances at a site. Under the
    authority of CERCLA and its implementing regulations, detailed
    requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and
    remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances
    have been or are threatened to be released into the environment.
    Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the existence or
    disposal of only “hazardous wastes,” but also can be
    based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700
    “substances,” characterized by the EPA as
    “hazardous” many of which are found in common
    household waste.

Among other things, CERCLA authorizes the federal government to
    investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances
    have been or are threatened to be released into the environment
    or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the
    hazardous substances to do so themselves. In addition, the



EPA has established a National Priorities List of sites at which
    hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released
    and which require investigation or cleanup.

CERCLA liability is strict liability. It can be founded upon the
    release or threatened release, even as a result of
    unintentional, non-negligent or lawful action, of hazardous
    substances, including very small quantities of such substances.
    Thus, even if we have never knowingly transported or received
    hazardous waste, it is likely that hazardous substances have
    been deposited or “released” at landfills or other
    facilities that we presently or historically have owned or
    operated, or at properties owned by third parties to which we
    have transported waste. Therefore, we could be liable under
    CERCLA for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at
    such sites and for damages to natural resources, even if those
    substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired
    or operated them. The costs of a CERCLA cleanup can be very
    expensive and can include the costs of disposing remediation
    wastes at appropriately-licensed facilities. Given the
    difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment
    liability, such liability could have a material impact on our
    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

•

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972

(the
    Clean Water Act). This act regulates the discharge of pollutants
    from a variety of sources, including solid waste disposal sites,
    into streams, rivers and other waters of the United States.
    Runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is
    discharged into surface waters through discrete conveyances must
    be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to
    conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under certain
    circumstances, to reduce the quantity of pollutants in those
    discharges. Storm water discharge regulations under the Clean
    Water Act require a permit for certain construction activities
    and for runoff from industrial operations and facilities, which
    may affect our operations. If a landfill or transfer station
    discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly
    owned treatment works, the facility must comply with discharge
    limits imposed by that treatment works. In addition, states may
    adopt groundwater protection programs under the Clean Water Act
    or the Safe Drinking Water Act that could affect the manner in
    which our solid waste landfills monitor and control their waste
    management activities. Furthermore, in the event that
    development at any of our facilities alters or affects wetlands,
    we may be required to secure permits prior to such development
    commencing. In these situations, permitting agencies may require
    mitigation of wetland impacts.

•

The Clean Air Act.

The Clean Air Act imposes
    limitations on emissions from various sources, including
    landfills. In March 1996, the EPA promulgated regulations that
    require large municipal solid waste landfills to install
    landfill gas monitoring systems. These regulations apply to
    landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction or
    modification on or after May 30, 1991, and, principally, to
    landfills that can accommodate 2.5 million cubic meters or
    more of municipal solid waste. The regulations apply whether the
    landfill is active or closed. The date by which each affected
    landfill is required to have a gas collection and control system
    installed and made operational varies depending on calculated
    emission rates at the landfill. Efforts to curtail the emission
    of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effect of climate
    change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent
    emission controls and monitoring systems, with resulting capital
    or operating costs. In addition, our vehicle fleet may also
    become subject to higher efficiency standards or other
    carbon-emission restrictions. See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

– “Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions
    could impose costs on our operations, the magnitude of which we
    cannot yet estimate.” Many state regulatory agencies also
    currently require monitoring systems for the collection and
    control of certain landfill gas. Certain of these state agencies
    are also implementing greenhouse gas control regulations that
    would also apply to landfill gas emissions.

•

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970

(OSHA). OSHA authorizes the Occupational Safety and
    Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor to
    promulgate occupational safety and health standards. A number of
    these standards, including standards for notices of hazardous
    chemicals and the handling of asbestos, apply to our facilities
    and operations.

State and Local Regulation.

Each state in
    which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing
    solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most
    cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and
    liabilities for such matters. States also have adopted
    regulations governing the design, operation, maintenance and
    closure of landfills and transfer stations. Some counties,
    municipalities and other local governments have



adopted similar laws and regulations. Our facilities and
    operations are likely to be subject to these types of
    requirements. In addition, our operations may be affected by the
    trend in many states toward requiring the development of solid
    waste reduction and recycling programs. For example, several
    states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities
    to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce, through solid waste
    planning, composting, recycling or other programs, the volume of
    solid waste deposited in landfills. Additionally, laws and
    regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid
    waste landfills, including yard waste, newspapers, beverage
    containers, unshredded tires, lead-acid batteries, electronic
    wastes and household appliances, have been promulgated in
    several states and are being considered in others. Legislative
    and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction
    at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under
    consideration by the U.S. Congress and the EPA.

To construct, operate and expand a landfill, we must obtain one
    or more construction or operating permits, as well as zoning and
    land use approvals. These permits and approvals may be
    burdensome to obtain and to comply with, are often opposed by
    neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups, may be subject
    to periodic renewal, and are subject to denial, modification,
    non-renewal and revocation by the issuing agency. Significant
    compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these
    processes. In connection with our acquisition of existing
    landfills, we may be required to expend considerable time,
    effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into
    compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the
    permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity.

Other Regulations.

Many of our facilities own
    and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to
    store petroleum-based products. These tanks are generally
    subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that
    mandate their periodic testing, upgrading, closure and removal.
    In the event of leaks or releases from these tanks, these
    regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be
    remediated. We believe that all of our underground storage tanks
    meet all applicable regulations. If underground storage tanks we
    own or operate leak, we could be liable for response costs and,
    if the leakage migrates onto the property of others, we could be
    liable for damages to third parties. We are unaware of facts
    indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to
    underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows.

With regard to our solid waste transportation operations, we are
    subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board
    and are regulated by the Federal Highway Administration, Office
    of Motor Carriers, and by regulatory agencies in states that
    regulate such matters. Various state and local government
    authorities have enacted or promulgated, or are considering
    enacting or promulgating, laws and regulations that would
    restrict the transportation of solid waste across state, county,
    or other jurisdiction lines. In 1978, the U.S. Supreme
    Court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of

out-of-state

solid waste is unconstitutional; however, states have attempted
    to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and
    implicated by that ruling. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled that
    a flow control law, which attempted to restrict solid waste from
    leaving its place of generation, imposes an impermissible burden
    upon interstate commerce, and, therefore, is unconstitutional.
    In 2007, the Supreme Court upheld the right of a local
    government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly owned
    and publicly operated waste facility. A number of county and
    other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other
    regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across
    jurisdictional boundaries. Other governments may enact similar
    regulations in the future. These regulations may, in some cases,
    cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills
    or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal,
    thereby adversely affecting our operations.

Liabilities Established for Landfill and Environmental
    Costs.

We have established reserves for landfill
    and environmental costs, which include landfill site final
    capping, closure and post-closure costs. We periodically
    reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions
    regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of
    Subtitle D of RCRA, and we adjust our rates used to expense
    final capping, closure and post-closure costs accordingly. Based
    on current information and regulatory requirements, we believe
    that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental
    expenditures are adequate. However, environmental laws may
    change, and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will
    be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new
    environmental laws and regulations, future changes or
    interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or adverse
    environmental conditions previously unknown to us.



Liability
    Insurance and Bonding

The nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities
    arising out of our operations, including possible damages to the
    environment. Such potential liabilities could involve, for
    example, claims for remediation costs, personal injury, property
    damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be
    held responsible for the escape of harmful materials; claims of
    employees, customers or third parties for personal injury or
    property damage occurring in the course of our operations; or
    claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning
    or performance of work. We could also be subject to fines and
    civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged
    violations of regulatory requirements. Because of the nature and
    scope of the possible environmental damages, liabilities imposed
    in environmental litigation can be significant. Our solid waste
    operations have third party environmental liability insurance
    with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations,
    subject to certain limitations and exclusions. However, we
    cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance
    would be adequate, in scope or amount, in the event of a major
    loss, nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry
    excess environmental liability insurance should market
    conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs
    prohibitive.

We have general liability, vehicle liability, employment
    practices liability, pollution liability, directors and
    officers’ liability, workers’ compensation and
    employer’s liability coverage, as well as umbrella
    liability policies to provide excess coverage over the
    underlying limits contained in these primary policies. We also
    carry property insurance. Although we try to operate safely and
    prudently and we have, subject to limitations and exclusions,
    substantial liability insurance, we cannot assure you that we
    will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.

Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability, and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. Claims in excess of
    self-insurance levels are insured subject to the excess policy
    limits and exclusions. Accruals are based on claims filed and
    actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred
    but not reported. Due to the variable condition of the insurance
    market, we have experienced, and may experience in the future,
    increased self-insurance retention levels and increased
    premiums. As we assume more risk for self-insurance through
    higher retention levels, we may experience more variability in
    our self-insurance reserves and expense.

In the normal course of business, we post performance bonds,
    insurance policies, letters of credit, or cash or marketable
    securities deposits in connection with municipal residential
    collection contracts, closure and post-closure of landfills,
    environmental remediation, environmental permits, and business
    licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our
    performance. To date, we have satisfied financial responsibility
    requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or
    by obtaining bank letters of credit, insurance policies or
    surety bonds.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we employed approximately
    30,000 full-time employees, approximately 27% of whom were
    covered by collective bargaining agreements. From time to time,
    our operating locations may experience union organizing efforts.
    We have not historically experienced any significant work
    stoppages. We currently have no disputes or bargaining
    circumstances that we believe could cause significant
    disruptions in our business. Our management believes that we
    have good relations with our employees.

We
    have substantial indebtedness, which may limit our financial
    flexibility.

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    $7.0 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases
    outstanding. This amount of indebtedness and our debt service
    requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access
    additional capital and make capital expenditures and other
    investments in our business, to withstand economic downturns and
    interest rate increases, to plan for or react to changes in our
    business and our industry, and to comply with the financial and
    other restrictive covenants of our debt instruments. Further,
    our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants
    contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in
    economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond
    our control. If we do not comply with these covenants and
    restrictions, we may be required to take actions such as
    reducing or delaying capital expenditures, reducing dividends or
    stock repurchases, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing
    all or part of our existing debt, or seeking additional equity
    capital.

The
    downturn in the U.S. economy may continue to have an adverse
    impact on our operating results.

A weak economy generally results in decreases in the volumes of
    waste generated. In 2010, weakness in the U.S. economy had
    a negative effect on our revenue, operating results and
    operating cash flows. The current and previous economic
    slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection
    business servicing the manufacturing and construction
    industries. As a result of the global economic crisis, we may
    experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing
    pressure and customer turnover as well. We cannot assure you
    that worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring
    recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash
    flows. Furthermore, recovery in solid waste volumes historically
    has lagged behind recovery in the general economy and we cannot
    assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions
    will result in an immediate, or any, improvement in our
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash
    flows.



The
    downturn in the U.S. economy may expose us to credit risk for
    amounts due from governmental agencies, large national accounts
    and others.

The weak U.S. economy has reduced the amount of taxes
    collected by various governmental agencies. We provide services
    to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities.
    These governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties
    resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be
    unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us. In addition, the
    weak economy may cause other customers, including our large
    national accounts, to suffer financial difficulties and
    ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us.
    This could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The
    downturn in the U.S. economy and in the financial markets could
    expose us to counter-party risk associated with our
    derivatives.

To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in various commodities
    and interest rates, we have entered into a number of derivative
    agreements. These derivative agreements require us or the
    counter-party to such agreements to make payments to the other
    party if the price of certain commodities or interest rates vary
    from a specified amount. Although we only enter these agreements
    with investment grade-rated financial institutions, a continued
    downturn in the U.S. economy or in the financial markets
    could adversely impact the financial stability of the
    counter-parties with which we do business, potentially limiting
    their ability to fulfill their obligations under our derivative
    agreements. This could have a negative impact on our
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

The
    waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors
    that may have greater financial and operational resources,
    flexibility to reduce prices and other competitive advantages
    that could make it difficult for us to compete
    effectively.

We principally compete with large national waste management
    companies, numerous municipalities, and numerous regional and
    local companies for collection and disposal accounts.
    Competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price
    and the quality of services. Competition for disposal business
    is primarily based on disposal costs, geographic location and
    quality of operations. One of our competitors may have greater
    financial and operational resources than we do. Further, many
    counties and municipalities that operate their own waste
    collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax
    revenue or tax-exempt financing. Our ability to obtain solid
    waste volume for our landfills may also be limited by the fact
    that some major collection companies also own or operate
    landfills to which they send their waste. In markets in which we
    do not own or operate a landfill, our collection operations may
    operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors. As a
    result of these factors, from time to time we may have
    difficulty competing effectively in certain markets. If we were
    to lower prices to address these competitive issues, it could
    negatively impact our revenues and profitability.

Price
    increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased
    costs and may cause us to lose volume.

We seek to secure price increases necessary to offset higher
    costs (including fuel and environmental costs), to maintain or
    improve operating margins, and to obtain adequate returns on our
    substantial investments in assets such as our landfills. From
    time to time, our competitors may reduce their prices in an
    effort to expand their market share. Contractual, general
    economic or market-specific conditions also may limit our
    ability to raise prices. For example, many of our contracts have
    price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as
    the Consumer Price Index. Particularly in a weak
    U.S. economy such as the current one, our costs may
    increase in excess of the increase, if any, in the Consumer
    Price Index. This may continue to be the case even when the
    U.S. economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste
    industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the
    general economy. As a result, we may be unable to offset
    increases in costs, improve our operating margins and obtain
    adequate investment returns through price increases. We may also
    lose volume to lower-cost competitors.



Increases
    in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals will increase our
    operating expenses, and we cannot assure you that we will be
    able to recover fuel or oil cost increases from our
    customers.

We depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our
    collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for
    collection, transfer, and disposal. Fuel prices are
    unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on events
    beyond our control, including geopolitical developments, actions
    by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and
    other oil and gas producers, supply and demand for oil and gas,
    war, terrorism and unrest in oil-producing countries, and
    regional production patterns. Due to contractual or market
    factors, we may not be able to offset such volatility through
    fuel surcharges. For example, our fuel costs were
    $407.6 million in 2010, representing 5.0% of our revenue
    compared to $349.8 million in 2009, representing 4.3% of
    our revenue.

To manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices, we have
    entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make
    payments to counter-parties should the price of fuel vary from a
    specified amount. During 2010, approximately 7% of our fuel
    volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements. Additionally,
    we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers.
    For 2010, we were able to recover approximately 66% of our fuel
    costs with fuel recovery fees.

Over the last several years, regulations have been adopted
    mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor
    vehicles. In November 2010, EPA finalized its Renewable Fuel
    Standard for 2011, which mandates increasing volumes of
    renewable fuels and biofuels to be used in motor vehicles driven
    in the U.S. These regulations will likely affect the type of
    fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses and in the near-term increase
    the cost of that fuel. Our operations also require the use of
    products (such as liners at our landfills) whose costs may vary
    with the price of petrochemicals. An increase in the price of
    petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products, which
    would increase our operating and capital costs. We are also
    susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our
    vendors.

Fluctuations
    in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may
    adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results
    of operations and cash flows.

We process recyclable materials such as paper, cardboard,
    plastics, aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties.
    Our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or
    market requirements for recyclable materials. The resale and
    purchase prices of, and market demand for, recyclable materials
    can be volatile due to changes in economic conditions and
    numerous other factors beyond our control. These fluctuations
    may affect our consolidated financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows. We have in the past, and may in the
    future, enter into swap agreements whereby we receive or make
    payments to counter-parties if the price of commodities varies
    from a specified amount or range.

Adverse
    weather conditions may limit our operations and increase the
    costs of collection and disposal.

Our collection and landfill operations could be adversely
    impacted by extended periods of inclement weather, or by
    increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting in
    the future from climate change, any of which could increase the
    volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without
    corresponding compensation), interfere with collection and
    landfill operations, delay the development of landfill capacity
    or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers. In
    addition, adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary
    suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect our
    operating results in the affected regions during those periods.

We
    currently have matters pending with the Internal Revenue Service
    (the “IRS”), which could result in large cash
    expenditures and could have a material adverse impact on our
    operating results and cash flows.

During its examination of Allied’s 2002 tax year, the IRS
    asserted that a 2002 redemption of four partnership interests in

waste-to-energy

businesses should have been recharacterized as disguised sale
    transactions. This issue is currently before the Appeals
    Division of the IRS. The Company believes its position is
    supported by relevant technical authorities and strong business
    purpose and we intend to vigorously defend our position on



this matter. The potential tax and interest through
    December 31, 2010 (to the extent unpaid) have been fully
    reserved in our consolidated balance sheet. A disallowance would
    not materially affect our consolidated results of operations;
    however, a deficiency payment would adversely impact our cash
    flow in the period the payment was made. The accrual of
    additional interest charges through the time this matter is
    resolved will affect our consolidated results of operations. In
    addition, the successful assertion by the IRS of penalty and
    penalty-related interest in connection with this matter could
    have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Additionally, during its examination of Allied’s 2000
    through 2007 tax years, the IRS proposed that certain landfill
    costs be allocated to the collection and control of methane gas
    that is naturally emitted from landfills. The IRS’ position
    is that the methane gas emitted by a landfill constitutes a
    joint product resulting from landfill operations and, therefore,
    associated costs should not be expensed until the methane gas is
    sold or otherwise disposed. We believe we have several
    meritorious defenses, including the fact that methane gas is not
    actively produced for sale by us but rather arises naturally in
    the context of providing disposal services. Therefore, we
    believe that the resolution of this issue will not have a
    material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

For additional information on these matters, see Note 10,

Income Taxes,

to our consolidated financial statements in
    Item 8. of this

Form 10-K.

We may
    be unable to execute our financial strategy.

Our ability to execute our financial strategy depends on our
    ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt.
    The credit rating process is contingent upon a number of
    factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure
    you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade
    ratings in the future. Our interest expense would increase and
    our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be
    adversely affected should we fail to maintain investment grade
    ratings.

Our financial strategy is also dependent on our ability to
    generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing
    business, fund internal growth, acquire other solid waste
    businesses, pay dividends, repurchase stock, reduce indebtedness
    and minimize borrowings, and take other actions to enhance
    stockholder value. We cannot assure you that: we will be
    successful in executing our broad-based pricing program; we will
    generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy;
    we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate, we
    will be able to increase the amount of such dividends, or we
    will be able to continue our share repurchase program.

A
    downgrade in our bond ratings could adversely affect our
    liquidity by increasing the cost of debt and financial assurance
    instruments.

While downgrades of our bond ratings may not have an immediate
    impact on our cost of debt or liquidity, they may impact our
    cost of debt and liquidity over the near to medium term. If the
    rating agencies downgrade our debt, this may increase the
    interest rate we must pay to issue new debt, and it may even
    make it prohibitively expensive for us to issue new debt. If our
    debt ratings are downgraded, future access to financial
    assurance markets at a reasonable cost, or at all, also may be
    adversely impacted.

The
    solid waste industry is a capital-intensive industry and the
    amount we spend on capital expenditures may exceed current
    expectations, which could require us to obtain additional
    funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our
    business.

Our ability to remain competitive and to grow and expand our
    operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and
    access to capital. If our capital efficiency programs are unable
    to offset the impact of inflation and business growth, it may be
    necessary to increase the amount we spend. Additionally, if we
    make acquisitions or further expand our operations, the amount
    we expend on capital, capping, closure, post-closure and
    environmental remediation expenditures will increase. Our cash
    needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping,
    closure, post-closure and remediation activities increase above
    our current estimates, which may



occur over a long period due to changes in federal, state or
    local government requirements and other factors beyond our
    control. Increases in expenditures would negatively impact our
    cash flows.

Over the last several years, regulations have been adopted
    mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions. In May
    2010, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety
    Administration (“NHTSA”) finalized the first
    U.S. standards for GHG emissions from conventional
    automobiles, including large

pick-up

trucks. These regulations include increased fuel economy
    requirements and apply to new motor vehicles covering model
    years 2012 through 2016. We do not expect that this final rule
    will lead to a material increase in our capital costs. Later in
    2010 the EPA and the NHTSA proposed rules expanding the scope of
    GHG emission standards for motor vehicles to include heavy duty
    vehicles, including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor
    trailers. These rules would similarly include increased fuel
    economy standards for such vehicles and would apply to new
    heavy-duty motor vehicles covering model years 2014 through
    2018. Because the rule is still in the proposal stage, we cannot
    predict its effect on us but it could increase our capital
    costs. This also could cause an increase in vehicle operating
    costs or a reduction in operating efficiency.

We may
    be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand
    existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which could
    decrease our revenue and increase our costs.

We cannot assure you that we will successfully obtain or
    maintain the permits we require to operate our business because
    permits to operate non-hazardous solid waste landfills and to
    expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become
    more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. Permits
    often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and
    compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and
    other regulations. These permits are also often subject to
    resistance from citizen or other groups and other political
    pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent
    landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a
    permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits
    under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which
    we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for
    environmental damage. Responding to these challenges has, at
    times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with
    establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities.
    In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval
    may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding
    existing facilities. Our failure to obtain the required permits
    to operate our non-hazardous solid waste landfills could have a
    material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may have
    to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our
    competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to
    one of our other landfills, either of which could significantly
    increase our waste disposal costs.

The waste industry is subject to extensive government
    regulation, and existing or future regulations may restrict our
    operations, increase our costs of operations or require us to
    make additional capital expenditures.

If we
    inadequately accrue for landfill capping, closure and
    post-closure costs, our financial condition and results of
    operations may be adversely affected.

A landfill must be closed and capped, and post-closure
    maintenance commenced, once the permitted capacity of the
    landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized.
    We have significant financial obligations relating to capping,
    closure and post-closure costs at our existing owned or operated
    landfills, and will have material financial obligations with
    respect to any future owned or operated landfills. We establish
    accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping,
    closure and post-closure financial obligations. We could
    underestimate such accruals, and our financial obligations for
    capping, closure or post-closure costs could exceed the amount
    accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds
    established for this purpose. Such a shortfall could result in
    significant unanticipated charges to income. Additionally, if a
    landfill is required to be closed earlier than expected or its
    remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason, the accruals
    for capping, closure and post-closure could be required to be
    accelerated, which could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.



We
    cannot assure you that we will continue to operate our landfills
    at current volumes due to the use of alternatives to landfill
    disposal caused by state requirements or voluntary
    initiatives.

Most of the states in which we operate landfills require
    counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to
    reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through
    waste planning, composting and recycling, or other programs.
    Some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the
    source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes,
    such as yard waste, at landfills. Although such actions are
    useful in protecting our environment, these actions, as well as
    voluntary private initiatives by customers to reduce waste or
    seek disposal alternatives, have reduced and will in the future
    reduce the volume of waste going to landfills. Accordingly, we
    cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills
    at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill
    disposal services due to the decrease in demand for such
    services.

The
    possibility of landfill and transfer station site development
    projects, expansion projects or pending acquisitions not being
    completed or certain other events could result in a material
    charge to income.

We capitalize certain expenditures relating to development,
    expansion and other projects. If a facility or operation is
    permanently shut down or determined to be impaired, or a
    development or expansion project is not completed or is
    determined to be impaired, we will charge any unamortized
    capitalized expenditures to income relating to such facility or
    project that we are unable to recover through sale, transfer or
    otherwise. In future periods, we may incur charges against
    earnings in accordance with this policy, or other events may
    cause impairments. Such charges could have a material adverse
    impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

We are
    subject to costly environmental regulations and flow-control
    regulations that may affect our operating margins, restrict our
    operations and subject us to additional liability.

Complying with laws and regulations governing the use,
    treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous
    wastes and materials, air quality, water quality and the
    remediation of contamination associated with the release of
    hazardous substances is costly. Laws and regulations often
    require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify
    landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill. We
    cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price
    increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these
    laws and regulations. In addition, environmental regulatory
    changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping,
    closure and post-closure, and environmental and remediation
    activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend
    sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes.

Our collection, transfer, and landfill operations are, and may
    in the future continue to be, affected by state or local laws or
    regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste
    across state, county or other jurisdictional lines or that
    direct the flow of waste to a specified facility. Such laws and
    regulations could negatively affect our operations, resulting in
    declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate
    disposal.

In addition to the costs of complying with environmental
    regulations, we incur costs to defend against litigation brought
    by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in
    violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and
    regulations, or who assert claims alleging environmental damage,
    personal injury or property damage. As a result, we may be
    required to pay fines or implement corrective measures, or we
    may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked. A
    significant judgment against us, the loss of a significant
    permit or license, or the imposition of a significant fine could
    have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows. We establish
    accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our
    environmental obligations. We could underestimate such accruals
    and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued. Such
    shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to
    income.



Regulation
    of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our
    operations, the magnitude of which we cannot yet
    estimate.

Efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and
    to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to be
    debated on the federal, regional, and state level. Our landfill
    operations emit methane, identified as a GHG, and our vehicle
    fleets emit, among others, carbon dioxide, which has also been
    identified as a GHG. Conventional wisdom now suggests that
    passage of comprehensive, federal climate change legislation is
    highly unlikely. Nonetheless, should comprehensive federal
    climate change legislation be enacted, we expect it to impose
    costs on our operations, the materiality of which we cannot
    predict.

Absent comprehensive federal legislation to control GHG
    emissions, EPA is moving ahead administratively under its
    existing Clean Air Act authority. In October 2009, EPA published
    a Proposed Prevention of Significant Deterioration and
    Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule (PSD tailoring rule).
    EPA finalized the PSD tailoring rule on May 13, 2010. The
    finalized PSD tailoring rule establishes new thresholds for GHG
    emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits would be
    required and would “tailor” these programs to limit
    which facilities would be required to obtain permits. EPA’s
    legal authority to “tailor” this rule has been
    challenged. As of January 2, 2011, some of our landfills
    became subject to the PSD tailoring rule, which requires permit
    amendments and could require additional emission controls for
    GHGs when modifications are made to these landfills, which could
    increase our costs.

On October 25, 2010, EPA and the Department of
    Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety
    Administration (NHTSA), proposed rules to reduce GHG emissions
    from medium and heavy duty vehicles. These proposed rules, if
    finalized, would impose higher fuel economy standards of heavy
    duty vehicles. As such, the proposed rules could require us to
    expend additional capital on our vehicle fleet.

In addition to the obligations imposed by the PSD tailoring
    rule, as a result of EPA finding that six GHGs endanger public
    health in December 2009 EPA may impose additional GHG emissions
    controls on stationary sources. While EPA made its finding in
    the context of regulating air emissions from motor vehicles, now
    that it has made the endangerment finding, other provisions of
    the Clean Air Act provide EPA with the authority to impose
    further regulations upon stationary sources of GHG emissions,
    including landfills. We cannot predict the requirements or
    effective date of any additional stationary source rules that
    might apply to landfills as a result of the endangerment finding
    and, accordingly, we cannot assure you that further developments
    in this area will not have a material effect on our landfill
    operations or on our consolidated financial condition, results
    of operations, or cash flows.

We may
    have potential environmental liabilities that are not covered by
    our insurance. Changes in insurance markets also may impact our
    financial results.

We may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the
    environment as a result of our operations. We maintain high
    deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage.
    If we were to incur substantial liability for environmental
    damage, our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such
    liability. This could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Also, due to the variable condition of the insurance market, we
    may experience future increases in self-insurance levels as a
    result of increased retention levels and increased premiums. As
    we assume more risk for self-insurance through higher retention
    levels, we may experience more variability in our self-insurance
    reserves and expense.

Despite
    our efforts, we may incur additional hazardous substances
    liability in excess of amounts presently known and
    accrued.

We are a potentially responsible party at many sites under
    CERCLA, which provides for the remediation of contaminated
    facilities and imposes strict, joint and several liability for
    the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a
    facility at which there has been a release or a threatened
    release of a “hazardous substance.” CERCLA liability
    also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at
    the time hazardous substances were disposed, and on persons who
    arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility
    (i.e.,



generators of the waste and transporters who selected the
    disposal site). Hundreds of substances are defined as
    “hazardous” under CERCLA and their presence, even in
    minute amounts, can result in substantial liability.
    Notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable
    regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous
    substances, we may have additional liability under CERCLA, or
    similar state laws or RCRA, in excess of our current reserves
    because such substances may be present in waste collected by us
    or disposed of in our landfills, or in waste collected,
    transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have
    acquired. Actual costs for these liabilities could be
    significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these
    purposes, which could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows.

Currently
    pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could
    result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or
    settlements.

We are, and from time to time become, involved in lawsuits,
    regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal
    proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business.
    Many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual
    and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and
    complexities. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits,
    regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal
    proceedings is uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or
    resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or
    settlements, either of which could require substantial payments,
    adversely affecting our consolidated financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.

We may
    be unable to manage our growth effectively.

Our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial,
    operational and management resources. To continue our growth, we
    may need to add administrative and other personnel, and will
    need to make additional investments in operations and systems.
    We cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train
    qualified personnel, or do so on a timely basis, or expand our
    operations and systems to the extent, and in the time, required.

We may
    be unable to execute our acquisition growth
    strategy.

Our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on
    our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition
    candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate
    acquired operations into our business. The consolidation of our
    operations with those of acquired companies may present
    significant challenges to our management. In addition,
    competition among our competitors for acquisition candidates may
    prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates. As
    such, we cannot assure you that:

•

desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified;

•

we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified;

•

we will effectively consolidate companies we acquire; or

•

any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings.

If any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our
    growth strategy, our growth prospects could be adversely
    affected.

Businesses
    we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities.

In pursuing our acquisition strategy, our due diligence
    investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to
    discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition
    candidates. If we acquire a company having undisclosed
    liabilities such as environmental, remediation or contractual,
    as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed
    liabilities. We expect to try to minimize our exposure to such
    liabilities by conducting due diligence, by obtaining
    indemnification from each of the sellers of the acquired
    companies, by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase
    price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only
    specified assets. However, we cannot assure you that we will be
    able to obtain indemnification or that any



indemnification obtained will be enforceable, collectible or
    sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset any
    undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions.

Our
    consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and
    assumptions that may differ from actual results.

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP and necessarily include amounts
    based on estimates and assumptions made by management. Actual
    results could differ from these amounts. Significant items
    requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments
    about matters that are inherently uncertain include the carrying
    value of long-lived assets, the depletion and amortization of
    landfill development costs, accruals for final capping, closure
    and post-closure costs, valuation allowances for accounts
    receivable and deferred tax assets, liabilities for potential
    litigation, claims and assessments, and liabilities for
    environmental remediation, employee benefit and pension plans,
    deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions and self-insurance.

We cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for landfill
    and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the
    requirements of existing environmental regulations, future
    changes to or interpretations of existing regulations, or the
    identification of adverse environmental conditions previously
    unknown to management.

The
    introduction of new accounting rules, laws or regulations could
    adversely impact our results of operations.

Complying with new accounting rules, laws or regulations could
    adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows, or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our
    results of operations in future periods.

We may
    be subject to workforce influences, including work stoppages,
    which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our
    operations.

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 27% of our workforce
    was represented by various local labor unions. If our unionized
    workers were to engage in strikes, work stoppages or other
    slowdowns, we could experience a significant disruption of our
    operations and an increase in our operating costs, which could
    have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows. Additional groups of
    employees may seek union representation in the future and, if
    successful, the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements
    could divert management attention and result in increased
    operating costs. If a greater percentage of our workforce
    becomes unionized, our business and financial results could be
    materially and adversely impacted due to the potential for
    increased operating costs.

Our
    obligation to fund multi-employer pension plans to which we
    contribute may have an adverse impact on us.

We contribute to at least 28 multi-employer pension plans
    covering at least 22% of our current employees. We do not
    administer these plans and generally are not represented on the
    boards of trustees of these plans. The Pension Protection Act
    enacted in 2006 (the PPA) requires under-funded pension plans to
    improve their funding ratios. Based on the information available
    to us, we believe that some of the multi-employer plans to which
    we contribute are either “critical” or
    “endangered” as those terms are defined in the PPA. We
    cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding,
    if any, we may be required to make to these plans and,
    therefore, have not recorded any related liabilities. However,
    plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of
    operations or cash flows for a given period. Furthermore, under
    current law, upon the termination of a multi-employer pension
    plan, or in the event of a withdrawal by us (which we consider
    from time to time) or a mass withdrawal of contributing
    employers (each, a “Withdrawal Event”), we would be
    required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate
    share of the plan’s unfunded vested liabilities. We cannot
    assure you that there will not be a Withdrawal Event with
    respect to any of the multi-employer pension plans to which we
    contribute or that, in the event of such a Withdrawal Event, the
    amounts we would be



required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact
    on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows.

The
    costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding
    requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and
    fluctuating actuarial assumptions, and may have a material
    adverse impact on our results of operations and cash
    flows.

We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan which is funded with
    trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and
    equity securities. Our costs for providing such benefits and
    related funding requirements are subject to changes in the
    market value of plan assets. Our pension expenses and related
    funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial
    calculations and assumptions, which may differ materially from
    actual results due to changing market and economic conditions,
    interest rates and other factors. A significant increase in our
    pension obligations and funding requirements could have a
    material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.

The
    loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flows and growth prospects.

Our future success depends on the continued contributions of
    several key employees and officers. The loss of the services of
    key employees and officers, whether such loss is through
    resignation or other causes, or the inability to attract
    additional qualified personnel, could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash
    flows and growth prospects.

PROPERTIES

Our corporate office is located at 18500 North Allied Way,
    Phoenix, Arizona 85054, where we currently lease approximately
    145,000 square feet of office space. We also maintain
    regional administrative offices in all of our regions.

Our principal property and equipment consists of land,
    landfills, buildings, vehicles and equipment. We own or lease
    real property in the states in which we conduct operations. At
    December 31, 2010, we owned or operated 348 collection
    companies, 204 transfer stations, 193 active solid waste
    landfills and 76 recycling facilities in 40 states and
    Puerto Rico. In aggregate, our active solid waste landfills
    total approximately 97,000 acres, including approximately
    36,000 permitted acres. We also own or have responsibilities for
    129 closed landfills. We believe that our property and equipment
    are adequate for our current needs.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations
    and have implemented our own safeguards to respond to regulatory
    requirements. In the normal course of conducting our operations,
    we become involved in legal proceedings. Some of these actions
    may result in fines, penalties or judgments against us, which
    may impact earnings and cash flows for a particular period.
    Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any legal
    matter with certainty, except as described below or in
    Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements,

Income
    Taxes

, in the discussion of our outstanding tax dispute with
    the IRS, we do not believe that the outcome of our pending legal
    proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

As used herein,

legal proceedings

refers to litigation
    and similar claims against us and our subsidiaries, excluding:
    (i) ordinary course accidents, general commercial liability
    and workers compensation claims, which are covered by insurance
    programs, subject to customary deductibles, and which, together
    with self-insured employee health care costs, are discussed in
    Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements,

Other
    Liabilities-Self-Insurance Reserves

; (ii) tax-related
    matters, which are discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated
    financial



statements,

Income Taxes;

and (iii) environmental
    remediation liabilities, which are discussed in Note 8 to
    our consolidated financial statements,

Landfill and
    Environmental Costs.

Please see our consolidated financial
    statements included in this

Form 10-K

under Item 8 for information about these matters.

We accrue for legal proceedings when losses become probable and
    reasonably estimable. We have recorded an aggregate accrual of
    approximately $113 million relating to our outstanding
    legal proceedings as of December 31, 2010, including those
    described herein and others not specifically identified herein.
    As of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review
    each of our legal proceedings and, where it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred, we accrue for all probable and
    reasonably estimable losses. Where we are able to reasonably
    estimate a range of losses we may incur with respect to such a
    matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range
    that constitutes our best estimate. If we are able to reasonably
    estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a
    better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the
    low end of such range. If we used the high ends of such ranges,
    our aggregate potential liability would have been approximately
    $121 million higher than the amount recorded as of
    December 31, 2010.

General
    Legal Proceedings

Countywide
    Matter

In a suit filed on October 8, 2008 in the Tuscarawas County
    Ohio Court of Common Pleas, approximately 700 individuals and
    businesses located in the area around Countywide sued Republic
    Services, Inc. and Republic-Ohio for alleged negligence and
    nuisance. Republic-Ohio has owned and operated Countywide since
    February 1, 1999. Waste Management, Inc. and Waste
    Management Ohio, Inc., previous owners and operators of
    Countywide, have been named as defendants as well. Plaintiffs
    allege that due to the acceptance of a specific waste stream and
    operational issues and conditions, the landfill has generated
    odors and other unsafe emissions that have impaired the use and
    value of their property and may have adverse health effects. A
    second almost identical lawsuit was filed by approximately 82
    plaintiffs on October 13, 2009 in the Tuscarawas County
    Ohio Court of Common Pleas against Republic Services, Inc.,
    Republic-Ohio, Waste Management, Inc., and Waste Management
    Ohio, Inc. The court has consolidated the two actions. We have
    assumed both the defense and the liability of the Waste
    Management entities in the consolidated action. The relief
    requested on behalf of each plaintiff in the consolidated action
    is: (1) an award of compensatory damages according to proof
    in an amount in excess of $25,000 for each of the three counts
    of the amended complaint; (2) an award of punitive damages
    in the amount of two times compensatory damages, pursuant to
    applicable statute, or in such amount as may be awarded at trial
    for each of the three counts of the amended complaint;
    (3) costs for medical screening and monitoring of each
    plaintiff; (4) interest on the damages according to law;
    (5) costs and disbursements of the lawsuit;
    (6) reasonable fees for attorneys and expert witnesses; and
    (7) any other and further relief as the court deems just,
    proper and equitable. Plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated
    complaint on September 9, 2010, which no longer asserts a
    claim for medical monitoring. As a result of various dismissals
    of plaintiffs, this case presently consists of approximately 600
    plaintiffs. Discovery is ongoing. We will vigorously defend
    against the plaintiffs’ allegations in the consolidated
    action.

Luri
    Matter

On August 17, 2007, a former employee, Ronald Luri, sued
    Republic Services, Inc., Republic Services of Ohio Hauling LLC,
    Republic Services of Ohio I LLC, Jim Bowen and Ron Krall in the
    Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court in Ohio. Plaintiff alleges
    that he was unlawfully fired in retaliation for refusing to
    discharge or demote three employees who were all over
    50 years old. On July 3, 2008, a jury verdict was
    awarded against us in the amount of $46.6 million,
    including $43.1 million in punitive damages. On
    September 24, 2008, the Court awarded pre-judgment interest
    of $0.3 million and attorney fees and litigation costs of
    $1.1 million. Post-judgment interest accrued at a rate of
    8% for 2008 and 5% for 2009, and is accruing at a rate of 4% for
    2010. Management anticipates that post-judgment interest could
    accrue through the middle of 2011 for a total of
    $7.7 million. We have filed a notice of appeal, and the
    case has been fully briefed in the Court of Appeals. It is
    reasonably possible that following all appeals a final judgment
    of liability for compensatory and punitive damages may be
    assessed against us related to this matter.



Litigation
    Related to Fuel and Environmental Fees

On July 8, 2009, CLN Properties, Inc. and Maevers
    Management Company, Inc. filed a complaint against Republic
    Services, Inc. and Allied Waste Industries, Inc. in the United
    States District Court in Arizona, in which plaintiffs complain
    about fuel recovery fees and environmental recovery fees. The
    complaint purports to be filed on behalf of a nationwide class
    of similarly situated plaintiffs. The complaint asserts various
    legal and equitable theories of recovery and alleges in essence
    that the fees were not properly disclosed, were unfair, and were
    contrary to contract. The District Court denied plaintiffs’
    motion for class certification on December 13, 2010.
    Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of that ruling,
    which the District Court also denied. Plaintiffs have not filed
    a timely interlocutory appeal, but could file an appeal after
    any judgment in this case. Based on the District Court’s
    opinion and the small amounts at issue with respect to the 10
    remaining plaintiffs, we will no longer report on this case
    after this

Form 10-K.

On July 23, 2009, Klingler’s European Bake
    Shop & Deli, Inc., filed a complaint against BFI Waste
    Services, LLC in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama,
    in which plaintiff complains about fuel/environmental recovery
    fees and administrative fees charged. The complaint purports to
    be filed on behalf of a class of similarly situated plaintiffs
    in Alabama. This complaint asserts various legal and equitable
    theories of recovery and alleges in essence that the fees were
    not properly disclosed, were unfair, and were contrary to
    contract.

Class-certification-related

discovery is underway. Plaintiff’s deadline for moving for
    class certification is August 12, 2011.

The plaintiffs in both actions have not specified the amount of
    damages sought. Although the range of reasonably possible loss
    cannot be estimated, we do not believe that these matters will
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial positions,
    results of operations or cash flows. We will continue to
    vigorously defend the claims in both lawsuits.

Proxy
    Disclosure Matter

In late 2009, a stockholder sued Republic Services, Inc. in
    Federal court in Delaware challenging our disclosures in our
    2009 proxy statement with respect to the Executive Incentive
    Plan (EIP) that was approved by our stockholders at the 2009
    annual meeting. The lawsuit is styled as a combined proxy
    disclosure claim and derivative action. We are a defendant only
    with respect to the proxy disclosure claim, which seeks only to
    require us to make additional disclosures regarding the EIP and
    to hold a new stockholder vote prior to making any payments
    under the EIP. The derivative claim is purportedly brought on
    behalf of our company against all of our directors and the
    individuals who were executive officers at the time of the 2009
    annual meeting and alleges, among other things, breach of
    fiduciary duty. That claim also seeks injunctive relief and
    seeks to recoup on behalf of our company an unspecified amount
    of the incentive compensation that may be paid to our executives
    under the EIP, as well as the amount of any tax deductions that
    may be lost if the EIP does not comply with Section 162(m)
    of the Internal Revenue Code. Defendants’ motions to
    dismiss plaintiff’s complaint have been fully briefed. We
    believe the lawsuit is without merit and is not material and
    intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiff’s
    allegations.

Contracting
    Matter

We discovered actions of non-compliance by one of our
    subsidiaries with the subcontracting provisions of certain
    government contracts in one of our markets. We reported the
    discovery to, and have had further discussions with, law
    enforcement and other authorities. Such non-compliance could
    result in payments by us in the form of restitution, damages, or
    penalties, or the loss of future business in the affected market
    or other markets. Based on the information currently available
    to us, including our expectation that our self-disclosure will
    be viewed favorably by the applicable authorities, we presently
    believe that the resolution of the matter, while it may have a
    material impact on our results of operations or cash flows in
    the period in which it is recognized or paid, will not have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.



Congress
    Development Landfill Matters

Congress Development Co. (CDC) is a general partnership
    that owns and operates the Congress Landfill. The general
    partners in CDC are our subsidiary, Allied Waste Transportation,
    Inc. (Allied Transportation), and an unaffiliated entity, John
    Sexton Sand & Gravel Corporation (Sexton). Sexton was
    the operator of the landfill through early 2007, when Allied
    Transportation took over as the operator. The general partners
    likely will be jointly and severally liable for the costs
    associated with the following matters relating to the Congress
    Landfill.

In a suit originally filed on December 23, 2009 in the
    Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois and subsequently amended
    to add additional plaintiffs, approximately 2,300 plaintiffs
    sued our subsidiaries Allied Transportation and Allied Waste
    Industries, Inc., CDC and Sexton. The plaintiffs allege bodily
    injury, property damage and inability to have normal use and
    enjoyment of property arising from, among other things, odors
    and other damages arising from landfill gas leaking, and they
    base their claims on negligence, trespass, and nuisance.
    Following the court’s order in our favor striking the
    plaintiffs’ allegations requesting actual damages in excess
    of $50,000,000 and punitive damages in excess of $50,000,000,
    the amount of damages being sought is unspecified. The court
    entered an order dismissing Allied Waste Industries, Inc.
    without prejudice on October 26, 2010. We intend to
    vigorously defend against the plaintiffs’ allegations in
    this action.

Livingston
    Matter

On October 13, 2009, the Twenty-First Judicial District
    Court, Parish of Livingston, State of Louisiana, issued its Post
    Class Certification Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
    in a lawsuit alleging nuisance from the activities of the CECOS
    hazardous waste facility located in Livingston Parish,
    Louisiana. The court granted class certification for all those
    living within a six mile radius of the CECOS site between the
    years 1977 and 1990. We have filed a notice of appeal with
    respect to the class certification order and briefing is
    complete. The parties are currently attempting to resolve the
    matter through mediation. If the mediation does not resolve the
    matter, we intend to continue to defend this lawsuit vigorously.

Legal
    Proceedings Involving Governmental Authorities with Possible
    Sanctions of $100,000 or More

Item 103 of the SEC’s

Regulation S-K

requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a
    governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the
    proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions unless we
    reasonably believe that the monetary sanctions will not equal or
    exceed $100,000. We are disclosing the following matters in
    accordance with that requirement:

Forward
    Matters

The District Attorney for San Joaquin County filed a civil
    action against Forward, Inc. and Allied Waste Industries, Inc.
    on February 14, 2008 in the Superior Court of California,
    County of San Joaquin. The complaint seeks civil penalties
    of $2,500 for each alleged violation, but no less than
    $10.0 million, and an injunction against Forward and Allied
    for alleged permit and regulatory violations at the Forward
    Landfill. The District Attorney contends that the alleged
    violations constitute unfair business practices under the
    California Business and Professions Code section 17200, et
    seq., by virtue of violations of Public Resources Code
    Division 30, Part 4, Chapter 3, Article 1,
    sections 44004 and 44014(b); California Code of Regulations
    Title 27, Chapter 3, Subchapter 4, Article 6,
    sections 20690(11) and 20919.5; and Health and Safety Code
    sections 25200, 25100, et seq., and 25500, et seq. Although
    the complaint is worded very broadly and does not identify
    specific permit or regulatory violations, the District Attorney
    has articulated three primary concerns in past communications,
    alleging that the landfill: (1) used green waste containing
    food as alternative daily cover, (2) exceeded its daily
    solid waste tonnage receipt limitations under its solid waste
    facility permit, and (3) received hazardous waste in
    violation of its permit (i.e., auto shredder waste).
    Additionally, the District Attorney alleges that landfill gas
    measured by a monitoring probe at the property boundary has
    exceeded an action level of five percent methane. We are
    vigorously defending against the allegations.

On February 5, 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) Region IX delivered a Finding and Notice of
    Violation to the Forward Landfill as a result of alleged
    violations of the Title V permit issued under



the Clean Air Act. The facility is jointly regulated by the EPA
    and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District.
    The alleged violations include operating gas collection
    wellheads at greater than 15% oxygen, experiencing a subsurface
    oxidation event on multiple occasions, and submitting inaccurate
    compliance certifications. While a complaint has not yet been
    filed, on December 15, 2010, the District issued a

60-day

Notice of Intent to Sue based on these allegations. We are
    undergoing nonbinding mediation with the agencies as we continue
    to vigorously defend against the allegations.

Imperial
    Landfill Matter

On May 18, 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of
    Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the Allegheny County Health
    Department (ACHD) presented the Imperial Landfill a proposed
    consent order and agreement for a series of alleged violations
    related to landfill gas, leachate control, cover management, and
    resulting nuisance odor complaints, primarily in late 2008 and
    2009. On March 12, 2010, we signed a Consent Assessment of
    Civil Penalties (CACP) with the PADEP in connection with
    PADEP’s allegations of violations at the landfill through
    November 16, 2009. The total penalty amount in the CACP was
    $650,000. On April 12, 2010, additional orders were issued
    against us by both the PADEP and the ACHD for the allegedly
    continuing failure to bring the landfill’s odor issues
    under control. We have concluded settlements with both agencies.
    On November 22, 2010, we finalized a Consent Order and
    Agreement (COA) with the ACHD, in which we paid a penalty of
    $225,000 for all violations up to the date of the COA and agreed
    to certain operational requirements. The ACHD withdrew its April
    12, 2010 Order. On December 22, 2010, we executed a COA
    with the PADEP, pursuant to which we have paid a penalty of
    $142,000 for all violations of which PADEP was aware from
    November 17, 2009 through December 15, 2010. We also
    agreed to certain operational requirements.

Sunshine
    Canyon Matter

On November 17, 2009, the South Coast Air Quality
    Management District (SCAQMD) issued a Petition for an Order for
    Abatement (Petition) as a result of a series of odor complaints
    and notices of violation alleged to be associated with the
    operations at the Sunshine Canyon Landfill located in Sylmar,
    California (Sunshine Canyon). The Petition described eight
    notices of violation beginning in November 2008 and continuing
    to November 2009. The SCAQMD’s independent Hearing Board
    held a series of public hearings between December 2009 and March
    2010, after which it issued a final order (Order) that requires
    certain operational changes aimed at odor control, and further
    requires Sunshine Canyon to perform several studies regarding
    odor control techniques, equipment and site meteorology. In July
    2010, the Hearing Board approved an amended Order suspending
    certain operational requirements contained in the initial Order
    pending completion of additional odor control studies. While the
    District prosecutor’s office has stated its intention to
    assess a penalty on Sunshine Canyon, it has not indicated the
    amount or type of such a penalty. In September 2010, the County
    of Los Angeles Department of Public Works (Department) issued a
    directive to Sunshine Canyon requiring the implementation of
    certain corrective measures aimed at reducing odors. Sunshine
    Canyon, the SCAQMD Hearing Board and SCAQMD staff are currently
    attempting to resolve conflicting requirements between the
    County’s directive and the Hearing Board’s Order.

Lorain
    County Landfill Matter

Since 2006, the Lorain County Landfill located in Lorain, Ohio
    has agreed to two consensual Director’s Final Findings and
    Orders (DFFO’s) issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection
    Agency related to operational issues, including odor nuisances.
    The Ohio Attorney General’s office has advised us that it
    intends to initiate legal proceedings against our subsidiary,
    Lorain County Landfill, LLC, and against Lorain County LFG Power
    Station Energy Developments, Inc., which has operated and
    maintained the landfill’s gas collection system, for
    violations that are alleged to continue to occur in violation of
    the DFFOs and are related to continuing alleged nuisance odors.
    We are engaging in discussions with representatives of the
    Attorney General’s office to attempt to amicably resolve
    the State’s issues and to negotiate a consent order that
    would be filed with the common pleas court. While the Attorney
    General’s office has stated its intention to assess a
    penalty on Lorain County Landfill, LLC (as well as Lorain County
    LFG Power Station Energy Developments, Inc.), it has not
    indicated



the amount or type of penalty it will seek. The Attorney
    General’s office also has indicated it will seek injunctive
    relief, but has not yet indicated what such injunctive relief
    would entail. Discussions with the Attorney General’s
    office are ongoing.

Queen
    Creek Matter

The Maricopa County Air Quality Department issued a Notice of
    Violation (NOV) to the Maricopa County Solid Waste Department
    (Solid Waste Department) in March 2010 and to the Town of Queen
    Creek (“Queen Creek”) and Allied Waste Industries
    (Arizona), Inc. (Allied Waste) in October 2010 relating to the
    Queen Creek Landfill (Landfill). The NOV alleges violations of
    the Clean Air Act relating to the Landfill while it was in
    operation. The Landfill was owned by Maricopa County and
    operated by Allied Waste under contract with Queen Creek between
    1996 and 2006, at which time it was closed. The NOV alleges the
    failure to design, install and operate a landfill gas collection
    control system, failure to timely apply for an air quality
    permit, and failure to provide required reports relating to
    landfill capacity, status and closure. Under the terms of
    several intergovernmental agreements between Maricopa County and
    Queen Creek, Maricopa County agreed to be responsible for the
    activities that are the subject of the NOVs and to indemnify
    Queen Creek and its contractors for Maricopa County’s
    failure to meet its obligations under the agreements. The
    Company will vigorously defend against the allegations and seek
    indemnification from Maricopa County.

SELECTED
    FINANCIAL DATA

The following Selected Financial Data should be read in
    conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes
    thereto as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 and
    Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations

included
    elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

The Allied acquisition was effective December 5, 2008 and
    has been accounted for as an acquisition of Allied by Republic.
    The consolidated financial statements include the operating
    results of Allied from the date of the acquisition, and have not
    been retroactively restated to include Allied’s historical
    financial position or results of operations. In accordance with
    the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid has
    been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon
    their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the
    excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being
    recorded as goodwill.

Our shares, per share data and weighted average common and
    common equivalent shares outstanding have been retroactively
    adjusted for all periods prior to 2007 to reflect a

3-for-2

stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was effective
    on March 16, 2007.

See Notes 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10 and 12 of the notes to our
    consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
    our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes
    thereto, included elsewhere herein. This discussion may contain
    forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on
    management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We
    discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual
    results to differ from expectations in Item 1A. Risk
    Factors.

Overview

We are the second largest provider of services in the domestic
    non-hazardous solid waste industry, as measured by revenue. We
    provide non-hazardous solid waste collection services for
    commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers
    through 348 collection companies in 40 states and Puerto
    Rico. We own or operate 204 transfer stations, 193 active solid
    waste landfills and 76 recycling facilities. We also operate
    73 landfill gas and renewable energy projects. We completed
    our acquisition of Allied Waste Industries, Inc. (Allied) in
    December 2008. We believe that this acquisition creates a strong
    operating platform that will allow us to continue to provide
    quality service to our customers and superior returns to our
    stockholders.

Despite the challenging economic environment, our business has
    performed well during 2010 due in large part to the
    indispensable nature of our services and the scalability of our
    business. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010
    decreased by 1.1% or $92.5 million to $8,106.6 million
    as compared to $8,199.1 million during the comparable
    period in 2009. Due to the Allied acquisition, the DOJ required
    us to divest of certain assets and related liabilities. The
    resulting divestitures, as well as other divestitures in the
    normal course of business, decreased revenue by 1.1% for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Excluding divested revenue, core revenue
    for the year ended December 31, 2010 was unchanged,
    consisting of a 1.6% increase in core price, 1.4% increase in
    commodity price and a 0.5% increase in fuel charges, offset by a
    decrease of 3.5% in core volume due to the continued weak
    economy. The core price increase, together with operating
    efficiencies arising from the acquisition and cost control
    measures taken by our operations management to scale the
    business down for lower volumes, served to moderate profit
    margin declines.

During 2010, we completed the integration of Allied operations
    resulting in approximately $190 million of annual run-rate
    synergy savings, of which $161 million relates to operating
    synergies and $29 million relates to financing synergies,
    exceeding our original estimate of approximately
    $150 million by 26.7%. Since the acquisition in 2008, we
    have repaid $1.3 billion of net borrowings through
    December 31, 2010 and have refinanced $1.5 billion of
    senior notes and $677.4 million of tax-exempt financings at
    lower interest rates. Free cash flow generated from operations
    allowed us to increase our regular quarterly dividend 5% in the
    third quarter of 2010 and in November 2010, our board of
    directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which
    we may repurchase up to $400.0 million of our outstanding
    shares of common stock.



    Guidance

Our objectives for 2011 remain consistent with previous years
    and focus on enhancing stockholder value by increasing returns
    on invested capital and through the efficient use of free cash
    flow. Despite the challenging economy, we remain committed to
    continuing our broad-based pricing program across all lines of
    business to recover increasing costs and to expand our operating
    margins.

Our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does
    not assume any improvement or deterioration in the overall
    economy in 2011. Specific guidance follows:

Revenue

We expect 2011 revenue to increase by approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.
    This consists of the following:

Increase

(Decrease)

Core price

1.0 to 1.5%

Volume

0.0 to 0.5%

San Mateo and Toronto contract losses

(1.5)%

Fuel surcharges

0.5%

Commodities

0.5%

Total change

0.5 to 1.5%

Approximately 50% of our annual revenue is restricted as to the
    amount of certain pricing changes. Such restrictions on price
    increases include but are not limited to each of the following:

•

Price changes based upon fluctuation in a specific index as
    defined in the contract;

•

Fixed price increases based on stated contract terms; or

•

Price changes based on a cost plus a specific profit margin or
    other measurement.

Of these restricted pricing arrangements, approximately 70% are
    based on a consumer price index, 20% are fixed arrangements and
    the remainder are based upon a cost plus or other specific
    arrangement. The consumer price index varies from a single
    historical stated period of time or an average of trailing
    historical rates over a stated period of time. In addition, many
    pricing resets lag between the measurement period and the date
    the revised pricing goes into effect. As a result, current
    changes in a specific index, such as the consumer price index,
    may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several
    quarters into the future.

Property
    and Equipment

In 2011, we anticipate receiving $750 million of property
    and equipment. Purchases of property and equipment as reflected
    on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2011 are
    expected to be $870 million and represent amounts paid
    during 2011 for such expenditures. The difference between
    property and equipment received and purchases of property and
    equipment is adjustments for approximately $120 million of
    property and equipment received during 2010 but paid for in 2011.

Recent
    Developments

Subsequent to December 31, 2010, we: (i) entered into
    certain interest rate locks with an aggregate notional amount in
    excess of $550.0 million to manage exposure to fluctuations
    in interest rates in anticipation of a planned issuance of
    senior notes in the first half of 2011 and (ii) financed the
    maturity of our $262.9 million 5.750% senior notes
    with proceeds from our Credit Facilities.



Business
    Acquisitions and Divestitures

We make decisions to acquire, invest in or divest of businesses
    based on financial and strategic considerations. Businesses
    acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of
    accounting and are included in our consolidated financial
    statements from the date of acquisition.

On December 5, 2008, we acquired all the issued and
    outstanding shares of Allied in a

stock-for-stock

transaction for an aggregate purchase price of
    $12.1 billion, which included $5.4 billion of debt, at
    fair value. We completed the integration of the operations of
    the two companies and converted to one operating system during
    2010.

As a condition of the Allied acquisition, the DOJ required us to
    divest of certain assets and related liabilities. We completed
    all of the required divestitures during 2009.

Loss on extinguishment of debt.

During 2010, we
    refinanced $677.4 million and repaid $97.8 million of
    our tax-exempt financings resulting in a loss on extinguishment
    of debt of $28.5 million related to the write-off of
    unamortized debt discounts and professional fees to effectuate
    these transactions.

Additionally, during 2010, we issued $850.0 million of
    5.00% senior notes due 2020 and $650.0 million of
    6.20% senior notes due 2040 (collectively, the Notes). We
    used the net proceeds from the Notes as follows:
    (i) $433.7 million to redeem the 6.125% senior
    notes due 2014 at a premium of 102.042% ($425.0 million
    principal outstanding); (ii) $621.8 million to redeem
    the 7.250% senior notes due 2015 at a premium of 103.625%
    ($600.0 million principal outstanding); and (iii) the
    remainder to reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit
    Facilities and for general corporate purposes. We incurred a
    loss on extinguishment of debt of $132.1 million for
    premiums paid to repurchase debt, to write-off unamortized debt
    discounts and for professional fees paid to effectuate the
    repurchase of the senior notes. Separately, we incurred a loss
    of $0.2 million in 2010 related to the write-off of
    unamortized deferred issuance costs associated with the accounts
    receivable securitization program.

During 2009, we issued $1,250.0 million of senior notes,
    the proceeds of which were primarily used to purchase and retire
    outstanding senior notes maturing in 2010 through 2034.
    Additionally, we repurchased certain of our outstanding senior
    notes in the secondary market.

Costs to achieve synergies.

During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, we incurred $33.3 million of
    incremental costs to achieve our synergy plan that are recorded
    in selling, general and administrative expenses versus
    $41.8 million and $2.9 million for the comparable 2009
    and 2008 periods, respectively. These incremental costs
    primarily relate to a synergy incentive plan as well as other
    integration costs. In 2011, we do not expect to incur any
    additional costs to achieve synergies.

Restructuring charges.

During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, we incurred $11.4 million of
    restructuring and integration charges related to the Allied
    acquisition versus $63.2 million and $82.7 million for
    the comparable 2009 and 2008 periods, respectively. These
    charges consist of severance and other employee termination and
    relocation benefits as well as consulting and professional fees.
    Substantially all of these charges were recorded in our
    corporate segment. In 2011, we do not expect to incur any
    additional restructuring charges related to the Allied
    acquisition.

Remediation (recoveries) charges.

During 2009, we
    recovered $(12.0) million of insurance proceeds related to
    remediation costs at the Countywide facility, which were
    partially offset by additional charges of $5.2 million at
    our closed disposal facility in California. Remediation and
    related charges of $156.8 million during 2008 were
    attributable to changes to our cost estimates at the Countywide
    facility, our closed disposal facility in California, and the
    Sunrise Landfill in Nevada.



Loss (gain) on disposition of assets and impairments,
    net.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we
    recorded a net loss on the disposition of assets of
    $4.0 million as a result of business divestures, including
    transaction costs. Additionally, during 2010 we recorded an
    impairment loss of $15.1 million related to certain
    long-lived assets that are held and used.

During 2009, we recorded net gain on disposition of assets, net
    of costs to sell of $(137.0) million related to the
    mandatory disposition of assets as required by DOJ as well as
    discretionary dispositions. During 2008, we recorded asset
    impairments of $89.8 million primarily related to the
    Countywide facility, our former corporate office in Florida and
    impairment on sales of DOJ required divestitures.

Tax effect of permanent items in adjustments.

During
    2008, our effective tax rate was impacted by several expenses
    associated with the acquisition that were not tax deductible.

In addition to the items discussed above, we incurred the
    following charges during the year ended December 31, 2008:

•

Conforming adjustments for accounting
    policies.

During 2008, we recorded bad debt expense of
    $14.2 million related to conforming Allied’s
    methodology for recording the allowance for doubtful accounts
    for accounts receivable with our methodology and
    $5.4 million to provide for specific bankruptcy exposures.

•

Legal reserves.

During 2008, we incurred
    $24.3 million of charges related to our estimates of the
    outcome of various legal matters.

•

Landfill amortization.

During 2008, we recorded
    $2.8 million of incremental landfill amortization expense
    as compared to the amortization expense Allied would have
    recorded for the same period.

We believe that the presentation of adjusted pre-tax income,
    adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. and
    adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures
    determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provide an
    understanding of operational activities before the financial
    impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe
    investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing
    performance of our operations separate from items that have a
    disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period.
    Comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior
    periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be
    expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of
    adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to
    Republic Services, Inc. and adjusted diluted earnings per share
    may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by
    other companies.

These gains and charges affected our consolidated statements of
    income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, as follows (in millions):

Revenue

We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection
    operations. Our remaining revenue is from other services,
    including transfer stations, landfill disposal and recycling.
    Our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we
    receive from commercial, industrial, municipal and residential
    customers. Our



residential and commercial collection operations in some markets
    are based on long-term contracts with municipalities. Certain of
    our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses
    that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the
    consumer price index. We generally provide commercial and
    industrial collection services to customers under contracts with
    terms up to three years. Our transfer station, landfill and, to
    a lesser extent, our material recovery facilities generate
    revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties.
    In general, we integrate our recycling operations with our
    collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of
    recyclable materials. Other revenue consists primarily of
    revenue from sales of recyclable materials and revenue from
    National Accounts. National Accounts revenue included in other
    revenue represents the portion of revenue generated from
    nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas,
    and, as such, the associated waste handling services are
    subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially
    all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs,
    which are recorded in cost of operations.

    year’s presentation.



Revenue –
    2010 versus 2009

The decrease in revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 is due to the
    following:

•

Changes in core price increased revenue by 1.6% in 2010 compared
    to 3.0% in 2009. The lower core price increase in 2010 compared
    to 2009 is due primarily to the lower inflationary environment
    which limits our price increases on index based contracts,
    partially offset by our continued broad-based pricing
    initiatives.

•

Changes in fuel surcharges increased revenue by 0.5% in 2010
    compared to a decrease of 2.5% in 2009. Revenue benefited from
    fuel surcharges resulting from higher fuel costs that were
    passed along to our customers in 2010. The increase in fuel
    surcharges in 2010 compared to 2009 is directly attributable to
    an increase in fuel costs.

•

Changes in commodity prices increased revenue by 1.4% in 2010
    compared to a decrease of 1.7% in 2009. Revenue benefited from
    higher commodity prices for recovered materials in 2010 compared
    to 2009.

•

Changes in core volume decreased revenue by 3.5% in 2010
    compared to 9.5% in 2009. During 2010, we continued to
    experience negative core growth in all lines of business,
    especially in temporary roll-off within our industrial
    collection business in the first half of 2010. Core volume
    continued to decline throughout 2010, however, at a lower rate
    than earlier in the year or in 2009.

•

Changes in acquisitions and divestitures, net decreased revenue
    by 1.1% in 2010 compared to 1.4% in 2009. The DOJ required us to
    divest of certain assets and related liabilities in connection
    with the Allied acquisition. The resulting divestitures, as well
    as other divestitures in the normal course of business,
    decreased revenue by 1.1% in 2010 compared to 2009.

Revenue –
    2009 versus 2008

The increase in revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 is due to the
    Allied acquisition in December 2008. Additionally:

•

Changes in core price increased revenue by 3.0% and 4.4% in 2009
    and 2008, respectively, due to our broad-based pricing
    initiative which we started during 2003.

•

Changes in fuel surcharges decreased revenue by 2.5% in 2009
    compared to an increase of 1.8% in 2008. Revenue benefited from
    fuel surcharges resulting from high fuel costs that were passed
    along to our customers during 2008. The decline in fuel
    surcharges in 2009 compared to 2008 is directly attributable to
    a decline in fuel costs.

•

Changes in commodity prices decreased revenue by 1.7% in 2009
    compared to an increase of 0.1% in 2008. During 2009, lower
    market demand resulted in lower pricing for the commodities we
    sell.

•

Changes in core volume decreased revenue by 9.5% and 3.8% in
    2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, we experienced
    negative core volume growth in all lines of business, especially
    in our industrial collection and landfill businesses, as a
    result of the challenging economic environment.

Cost
    of Operations

Cost of operations includes labor and related benefits, which
    consists of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits,
    incentive compensation and payroll taxes. It also includes
    transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to
    third party disposal facilities and transfer stations;
    maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment and
    containers, including related labor and benefit costs;
    transportation and subcontractor costs, which include costs for
    independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal
    facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste
    handling services associated with our national accounts in
    markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which
    includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of
    fuel credits; disposal franchise fees and taxes consisting of
    landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees
    and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes landfill
    accretion, financial assurance, leachate



disposal and other landfill maintenance costs; risk management,
    which includes casualty insurance premiums and claims; cost of
    goods sold, which includes material costs paid to suppliers
    associated with recycling commodities; and other, which includes
    expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent and
    gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations.

The following table summarizes the major components of our cost
    of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our
    revenue):

The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and
    may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by
    other companies. As such, care should be taken when comparing
    our cost of operations by cost component to that of other
    companies.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    approximately 67%, 68% and 58%, respectively, of the total waste
    volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we
    own or operate (internalization). This increase in
    internalization from 2008 to 2009 is due to a higher
    concentration of integrated hauling and landfill operations
    acquired in the Allied acquisition.

Cost of
    Operations – 2010 versus 2009

Our cost of operations, as a percentage of revenue, decreased
    0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the
    year ended December 31, 2009, primarily as a result of the
    following:

•

Transfer and disposal, maintenance and repair, and
    transportation and subcontract costs continue to decrease versus
    the comparable 2009 period due to lower waste volumes and cost
    control measures.

•

Risk management costs decreased during 2010 as we continued to
    experience favorable actuarial developments primarily
    attributable to our continued focus on safety.

Partially offset by:

•

Fuel expenses increased by $57.8 million, or 16.5%, year
    over year. Average fuel costs per gallon for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 were $2.99, an increase of $0.52 or
    approximately 21% from the average price of $2.47 for the year
    ended December 31, 2009.

•

Landfill operating costs increased by $18.4 million, or
    15.6%, year over year. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, we recovered $12.0 million of insurance proceeds
    related to remediation costs at the Countywide facility which
    reduced our landfill operating costs during that period. There
    were no such recoveries during the comparable 2010 period. The
    remainder of the increase in landfill operating costs is due to
    adjustments recorded at several remediation reserve sites.



Cost of
    Operations – 2009 versus 2008

Our cost of operations, as a percentage of revenue, improved
    6.5% to 59.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared
    to 65.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as
    a result of the following:

•

Transfer and disposal costs decreased as a percentage of revenue
    primarily due to lower fuel and disposal costs. In addition,
    transfer and disposal costs were also favorably impacted by
    increased internalization of our waste streams into landfills
    either owned or operated by us.

•

Fuel costs decreased approximately 35% from an average of $3.80
    per gallon during 2008 to an average of $2.47 per gallon during
    2009.

•

Landfill operating costs decreased 3.8% as a percentage of
    revenue, primarily due to charges we recorded during 2008
    consisting of $98.0 million related to estimated costs to
    comply with Final Findings and Orders issued by the Ohio
    Environmental Protection Agency and the Agreed Order on Consent
    issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in response to
    environmental conditions at the Countywide facility,
    $21.9 million related to environmental conditions at our
    closed disposal facility in California and $34.0 million
    related to environmental conditions at the Sunrise Landfill.
    These charges increased our 2008 cost of operations as a
    percentage of revenue by 4.2% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

•

Other cost of operations increased 0.7% as a percentage of
    revenue primarily due to increases in occupancy and facility
    expenses as well as equipment rental expense.

Depreciation,
    Amortization and Depletion of Property and
    Equipment

The following table summarizes depreciation, amortization and
    depletion of property and equipment for the years ended

Depreciation,
    Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment –
    2010 versus 2009

The decrease in landfill depletion and amortization in aggregate
    dollars and as a percentage of revenue is due to a reduction of
    amortization expense associated with lower landfill volumes and
    assets divested as required by the DOJ. Depreciation and
    amortization of property and equipment, as a percentage of
    revenue, has remained consistent year over year.

Depreciation,
    Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment –
    2009 versus 2008

The increase in depreciation, amortization and depletion
    expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to
    increases in depreciation and depletion expense associated with
    equipment and landfills acquired from Allied and recorded at
    their fair values. We allocated $2.6 billion of fair value
    to the landfills we acquired from Allied. The increase in the
    landfill depletion and amortization in aggregate dollars is
    directly attributable to this allocation of fair value.

Amortization
    of Other Intangible and Other Assets

Expenses for amortization of intangible and other assets were
    $71.5 million, $70.6 million and $11.8 million,
    or, as a percentage of revenue, 0.9%, 0.9% and 0.3% for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Our other intangible and other assets primarily relate to
    customer lists, franchise agreements, municipal contracts, trade
    names, favorable lease assets and to a lesser extent non-compete
    agreements. The



increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a
    percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009
    versus 2008 is due to the amortization of intangible assets
    recorded as a result of the Allied acquisition.

Accretion
    Expense

Accretion expense was $80.5 million, $88.8 million and
    $23.9 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 1.0%, 1.1%
    and 0.7% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. The decrease in accretion expense in 2010
    compared to 2009 is primarily due to the decrease in our
    weighted average credit-adjusted risk-free rate used to accrete
    new layers of our capping, closure and post-closure liabilities
    and the divestiture of several landfills. The increase in such
    expenses in aggregate dollars in 2009 versus 2008 is primarily
    due to an increase in asset retirement obligations associated
    with the Allied acquisition. The asset retirement obligations
    acquired from Allied are recorded using a discount rate of
    9.75%, which is higher than the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate
    we have used historically to record such obligations.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries,
    health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for
    corporate and field general management, field support functions,
    sales force, accounting and finance, legal, management
    information systems and clerical and administrative departments.
    Other expenses include rent and office costs, fees for
    professional services provided by third parties, marketing,
    investor and community relations, directors’ and
    officers’ insurance, general employee relocation, travel,
    entertainment and bank charges, but excludes any such amounts
    recorded as restructuring charges.

The following table provides the components of our selling,
    general and administrative costs for the three years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in millions of dollars
    and as a percentage of revenue):

The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and
    may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by
    other companies. As such, care should be taken when comparing
    our selling, general and administrative expenses by cost
    component to that of other companies.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses – 2010 versus

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
    $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to 2009 and, as a percentage of revenue, remained
    consistent with 2009. Selling, general and administrative
    expenses includes an accrual for synergy bonus related to the
    Allied acquisition of approximately $33 million in 2010 and
    $34 million in 2009. In 2011, we do not expect to incur any
    additional costs to achieve synergies.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses – 2009 versus

Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009 include
    $41.6 million of costs to achieve synergies related to the
    Allied acquisition. These costs primarily consist of a synergy
    related bonus of approximately $34 million accrued in 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded
    $14.2 million of bad debt expense related to conforming
    Allied’s methodology for recording the allowance for
    doubtful accounts on accounts receivable with ours and
    $5.4 million to provide for specific bankruptcy exposures.
    We also recorded $24.3 million of settlement



charges related to our estimates of the outcome of various legal
    matters and a charge of $2.9 million related to the synergy
    related bonus.

Excluding charges for synergies, conforming accounting policies,
    bankruptcies and certain legal matters, selling, general and
    administrative expenses for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008 would have been $824.7 million,
    $838.8 million and $387.9 million, or 10.2%, 10.2% and
    10.5% as a percentage of revenue, respectively. With the
    completion of the integration of Allied, our goal is to maintain
    our selling, general and administrative costs at no more than
    10.0% of revenue, which we believe is appropriate given our
    existing business platform.

Loss
    (gain) on Disposition of Assets and Impairments,
    Net

Loss (gain) on disposition of assets and impairments, net of
    costs to sell was $19.1 million, $(137.0) million and
    $89.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

We divested certain assets throughout 2010 resulting in a net
    loss on disposition of assets of $4.0 million, including
    transaction costs. Additionally, we recorded an impairment loss
    of $15.1 million related to certain long-lived assets that
    are held and used.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we divested of
    certain assets as required by the DOJ as a condition of the
    Allied acquisition and recorded a gain of $153.5 million.
    Offsetting this gain was a loss of $10.2 million recognized
    in connection with the divestiture of a hauling operation in
    Miami-Dade County, Florida as well as $7.1 million of
    additional asset impairments, primarily related to our former
    corporate offices and other assets sold or held for sale.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a
    charge of $75.9 million related to the impairment of the
    Countywide facility. This impairment relates to the anticipated
    loss of permitted airspace associated with complying with
    F&Os issued by the OEPA and the AOC issued by the EPA based
    upon recent negotiations with the OEPA and the EPA. Also during
    the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded
    $7.8 million of other impairment charges, consisting
    primarily of charges related to our former corporate office in
    South Florida.

Restructuring
    Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred
    $11.4 million of restructuring and integration charges
    related to the integration of Allied, which consisted of charges
    and adjustments for severance, employee termination and
    relocation benefits. The remainder of the charges primarily
    related to consulting and professional fees. Substantially all
    of these charges were recorded in our corporate entities
    segment. We do not expect to incur any significant additional
    charges with respect to this plan. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, we incurred $63.2 million
    and $82.7 million, respectively, of such charges.

Interest

    including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts
    primarily associated with environmental and self-funded risk

The decrease in interest expense during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 versus 2009 is due to refinancing our
    higher interest rate debt during 2010 and in the second half of
    2009 and the net reduction of borrowings.



The increase in interest expense during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 versus 2008 is primarily due to the
    additional debt we assumed as a result of the Allied
    acquisition. Interest expense also increased as a result of
    accreting discounts applied to debt or imputing interest on
    environmental and risk reserves assumed from Allied.

The debt we assumed from Allied was recorded at fair value as of
    December 5, 2008. We recorded a discount of
    $624.3 million, which is amortized as interest expense over
    the applicable terms of the related debt instruments or
    written-off upon refinancing. The remaining unamortized
    discounts on the outstanding debt assumed from Allied as of
    December 31, 2010 are as follows (in millions):

Loss
    on Extinguishment of Debt

Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $160.8 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting from the
    following:

•

During 2010, we refinanced $677.4 million and repaid
    $97.8 million of our tax-exempt financings resulting in a
    loss on extinguishment of debt of $28.5 million related to
    charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees
    paid to effectuate these transactions.

•

In March 2010, we issued $850.0 million of
    5.000% senior notes due 2020 and $650.0 million of
    6.200% senior notes due 2040. We used the net proceeds from
    these senior notes as follows: (i) $433.7 million to
    redeem the 6.125% senior notes due 2014 at a premium of
    102.042% ($425.0 million principal outstanding);
    (ii) $621.8 million to redeem the 7.250% senior
    notes due 2015 at a premium of 103.625% ($600.0 million
    principal outstanding); and (iii) the remainder to reduce
    amounts outstanding under our Credit Facilities and for general
    corporate purposes. We incurred a loss of $132.1 million
    for premiums paid to repurchase debt, to write-off unamortized
    debt discounts and for professional fees paid to effectuate the
    repurchase of the senior notes.

•

Additionally in March 2010, we repaid all borrowings and
    terminated our accounts receivable securitization program with
    two financial institutions that allowed us to borrow up to
    $300.0 million on a revolving basis under loan agreements
    secured by receivables. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of
    debt of $0.2 million related to the charges for unamortized
    deferred issuance costs associated with this program.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $134.1 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting from the
    following:

•

In September 2009, we issued $650.0 million of
    5.500% senior notes due 2019 with an unamortized discount
    of $4.5 million at December 31, 2009. A portion of the
    net proceeds from these notes was used to purchase and retire
    $325.5 million of our outstanding senior notes maturing in
    2010 and 2011.



•

In November 2009, we issued $600.0 million of
    5.250% Senior Notes due 2021. The net proceeds from these
    notes as well as draws on our revolver were used to purchase and
    retire our 7.875% Senior Notes due 2013 (redeemed at
    102.625%), our 7.375% Senior Notes due 2014 (redeemed at
    103.688%), and our 4.250% Senior Subordinated Convertible
    Debentures due 2034 (redeemed at par).

•

In addition, during 2009 we repurchased and retired certain of
    our senior notes in the secondary market.

In the future we may chose to voluntarily retire certain
    portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity using
    cash from operations or additional borrowings. We also may
    explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions.
    The early extinguishment of debt may result in an impairment
    charge in the period in which the debt is repurchased and
    retired.

Income
    Taxes

Our provision for income taxes was $369.5 million,
    $368.5 million and $85.4 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our
    effective income tax rate was 42.1%, 42.6% and 53.6% for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Our effective income tax rate is adversely impacted by expenses
    incurred which are non-deductible for tax, disposition of assets
    that have little or no basis for tax, and accruals for penalties
    and interest on uncertain tax positions.

In the future we may choose to divest certain operating assets
    that have little or no tax basis, thereby resulting in a higher
    taxable gain than otherwise would be recognized. The higher
    taxable gain will increase our effective rate in the quarter in
    which the divestiture is consummated.

Reportable
    Segments

Our operations are managed and reviewed through four geographic
    regions that we designate as our reportable segments. Summarized
    financial information concerning our reportable segments for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is shown in

Corporate entities include legal, tax, treasury, information
    technology, risk management, human resources, corporate accounts
    and other typical administrative functions. National Accounts
    revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of
    revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside
    our operating areas, and, as such, the associated waste handling
    services are subcontracted to local operators. Consequently,
    substantially all of this revenue is offset with related
    subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations.

We completed the reorganization of our operating segments
    related to the Allied acquisition in the first quarter of 2009,
    and are providing internal and external reporting in accordance
    with our reorganized structure. Significant changes in the
    revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments
    comparing 2010 to 2009 and 2009 to 2008 are discussed in the
    following paragraphs. The results of our reportable segments
    were also affected by the disposition of certain assets and
    liabilities, as required by the DOJ, as well as in the normal
    course of business. Additionally, for 2010 compared to 2009, the
    decrease in revenue resulting from declines in volumes noted
    below is attributable to the continued economic slowdown. The
    increase in aggregate dollars in 2009 compared to 2008 for
    revenue, depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion,
    and operating income (loss) for each of our reportable segments
    is due to the Allied acquisition.

    compared to 2009

Eastern
    Region

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 benefited from
    core price growth in all lines of business. However, the
    increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by
    volume declines in our collection and transfer station lines of
    business while our landfill line of business reflected a modest
    increase. The year ended December 31, 2010 includes revenue
    of $20.8 million associated with divested locations. The
    year ended December 31, 2009 includes revenue of
    $61.9 million associated with divested locations. Excluding
    the effect of the divested revenue, revenue increased
    $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    versus 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, operating margins
    were 23.5% versus 22.8% in 2009. The increase in operating
    margins is due primarily to lower labor, benefits, disposal,
    transportation, repair and maintenance expenses as a result of
    lower volumes and cost control measures as well as lower risk
    insurance costs partially offset by the loss on the disposition
    of assets of $15.0 million in 2010 compared to the gain of
    $4.0 million in 2009, as well as higher fuel costs and
    costs of commodities sold and an $12.0 million recovery of
    insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at the
    Countywide facility that reduced our landfill operating costs
    during the third quarter of 2009.

Midwestern
    Region

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 benefited from
    core price growth in all lines of business except landfill.
    While price associated with municipal solid waste volumes
    increased during 2010, this increase was offset by a higher mix
    of special waste volumes. However, the increase in revenue from
    core price, for the year ended December 31, 2010 was more
    than offset by volume declines in our collection and transfer
    station lines of business. Landfill volumes increased for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to special waste
    event driven work. The year ended December 31, 2010
    includes revenues of $22.5 million associated with divested
    locations. The year ended December 31, 2009 includes
    revenue of $31.5 million associated with divested
    locations. Excluding the effect of the divested revenue, revenue
    decreased $1.1 million for the year ended December 31,
    2010 versus 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, operating margins
    were 22.8% versus 20.7% in 2009. The increase in operating
    margins is due primarily to lower labor, benefits, disposal,
    transportation, and repair and maintenance expenses as a result
    of lower volumes and cost control measures as well as lower risk
    insurance costs and a favorable adjustment to amortization
    expense for asset retirement obligations of $10.6 million
    in 2010 compared to a favorable adjustment of $1.4 million
    in 2009 partially offset by the lower gain on the disposition of
    assets of $9.3 million in 2010 compared to a gain of
    $27.1 million in 2009, as well as higher fuel costs and
    costs of commodities sold.



Southern
    Region

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 benefited from
    core price growth in all lines of business except transfer
    station. However, the increase in revenue from core price was
    more than offset by volume declines, especially in our
    collection and landfill lines of business. Contributing to the
    decline in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was
    $30.4 million of revenue associated with divested
    locations. Excluding the effect of the divested revenue, revenue
    decreased $38.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 versus 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, operating margins
    were 24.4% versus 25.6% in 2009. The decrease in operating
    margins is due primarily to the gain on disposition of assets of
    $1.8 million in the 2010 period compared to the gain of
    $29.8 million in 2009 as well as higher fuel costs and
    costs of commodities sold, partially offset by lower labor,
    benefits, disposal and repair and maintenance expenses as a
    result of lower volumes and cost control measures and lower risk
    insurance costs.

Western
    Region

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 benefited from
    core price growth in all lines of business. However, the
    increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by
    volume declines, especially in our collection and transfer
    station lines of business. Landfill volumes in 2010 increased
    primarily due to special waste event driven work. The year ended
    December 31, 2009 includes revenues of $11.0 million
    associated with divested locations. Excluding the divested
    revenue, revenue increased $29.6 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 versus 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, operating margins
    were 23.8% versus 26.8% in 2009. The decrease in operating
    margins is primarily attributed to the loss on disposition of
    assets of $0.9 million in 2010 compared to the gain of
    $88.1 million in 2009 as well as higher fuel costs and
    costs of commodities sold, partially offset by lower risk
    insurance costs and a favorable adjustment to amortization
    expense for asset retirement obligations of $6.0 million in
    2010 compared to an unfavorable adjustment of $6.4 million
    in 2009. Additionally, we recorded a $5.2 million
    remediation charge in 2009 related to environmental conditions
    at our closed disposal facility in California.

The changes in net revenue relates to our National Accounts
    program serviced by third parties. Included in our gain (loss)
    on disposition of assets and impairments, net, for the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are transaction related
    expenses from the disposition of assets in our other segments.
    Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we
    recorded an impairment loss of $14.4 million related to
    certain long-lived assets that are held and used.

Eastern
    Region

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 benefited from
    core price growth in all lines of business. However, the
    increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by
    volume declines in all lines of business, especially in our
    industrial and landfill lines of business. We also experienced
    declines in fuel surcharges.

In 2009, we realized a $4.0 million net gain from the
    disposition of assets, which increased operating margins by
    0.2%. We also recovered $12.0 million of insurance proceeds
    related to remediation costs at the Countywide facility in Ohio,
    which increased operating margins by 0.6%.

In 2008, we incurred a $99.9 million charge for
    environmental conditions at the Countywide facility, which
    reduced our operating margin for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 by 10.1%. We incurred a
    $75.9 million charge related to the anticipated loss of
    permitted airspace at Countywide based upon negotiations with
    the



OEPA and EPA, which reduced our operating margin by 7.7%. We
    also incurred $11.0 million in legal settlement costs,
    which decreased operating margins by 1.1%.

The remaining increase in operating margins is attributed to
    lower fuel, disposal, and selling, general and administrative
    expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and
    amortization costs resulting from assets acquired from Allied
    and higher labor and facilities expense.

Midwestern
    Region

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 benefited from

In 2009, we realized net gains from the disposition of assets of
    $27.1 million, which increased operating margins by 1.5%.
    Otherwise, the improvement in operating margin for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to lower
    transportation, fuel, and selling, general and administrative
    expenses. The increase in operating margin was partially offset
    by increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting
    from assets acquired from Allied and higher facilities expense.

    $8.8 million favorable adjustment to amortization expense
    for asset retirement obligations which increased our operating
    margin by 0.4%. Otherwise the improvement in operating margin
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, is primarily due to
    lower disposal, transport and fuel costs, partially offset by
    increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we realized gains
    from the disposition of assets of $88.1 million, which
    increased operating margins by 4.1%. Partially offsetting these
    gains was an unfavorable adjustment to amortization expense for
    asset retirement obligations of $6.4 million, reducing
    operating margin by 0.3%, and remediation charges totaling
    $5.2 million, reducing operating margin by 0.3% related to
    environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in
    California. In addition, lower landfill revenue (which has
    higher margins than our collection line of business) negatively
    impacted 2009 margins.

In the second quarter of 2008, we incurred a $34.0 million
    charge at the Sunrise Landfill and a $21.9 million charge
    at our closed disposal facility in California for environmental
    conditions at each of these locations. The charges reduced
    operating margin by 5.9%. Margins were favorably impacted by
    lower labor, fuel, transportation and selling, general and
    administrative expenses, offset by increased depreciation and
    amortization expense resulting from assets acquired from Allied
    and higher facilities expense.



Corporate
    Entities

The increase in net revenue relates to Allied’s National
    Accounts program. The increase in depreciation, amortization,
    depletion and accretion expense, and the increase in the
    operating loss are attributable to the Allied acquisition.
    Included in our gain (loss) on disposition of assets and
    impairments, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 are
    transaction related expenses of $8.2 million from the
    disposition of assets in the other segments and a
    $3.7 million charge for the asset impairment associated
    with our former corporate office in Florida.

Landfill
    and Environmental Matters

Our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of
    capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure
    and post-closure, and the legal and administrative costs of
    ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses
    include leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and
    groundwater monitoring and system maintenance, interim cap
    maintenance, and costs associated with the application of daily
    cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development
    costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to
    landfill development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct
    costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on
    the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These
    costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site,
    including excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction
    of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas
    collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater
    monitoring wells, and other costs associated with the
    acquisition and development of the site. Obligations associated
    with final capping, closure and post-closure are capitalized and
    amortized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed.

Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and
    accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense
    capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate
    to changes in costs, available airspace, inflation and
    applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include
    changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes
    due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we
    believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted.

Changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications
    to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a
    refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated
    information. Changes in design typically include significant
    modifications to a landfill’s footprint or vertical slopes.

As of December 31, 2010, we owned or operated 193 active
    solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity
    estimated to be 4.7 billion in-place cubic yards. Total
    available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated
    permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion
    airspace. These estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers using information provided by annual aerial surveys.
    As of December 31, 2010, total available disposal capacity
    is estimated to be 4.6 billion in-place cubic yards of
    permitted airspace plus 0.1 billion in-place cubic yards of
    probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included in an
    expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace
    and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available
    disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion criteria.
    See Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,

and Note 8,

Landfill and Environmental Costs

, to
    our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for further information. During 2010, total available airspace
    increased by a net 0.1 billion cubic yards primarily due to
    new expansions and net acquisitions offset by airspace consumed
    and divestitures.

During 2009, total available airspace decreased by a net
    0.3 billion cubic yards primarily due to divestitures,
    closures and airspace consumed, partially offset by new
    expansions.

During 2008, total available airspace increased by a net
    3.2 billion cubic yards due to the Allied acquisition in
    December, which contributed 157 active landfills representing
    3.3 billion cubic yards of permitted and probable expansion
    airspace. Excluding the Allied acquisition, total available
    airspace related to Republic’s pre-acquisition operations
    decreased by a net 0.1 billion cubic yards, primarily due
    to airspace consumed, changes in engineering estimates and
    changes in design. The decrease during 2008 due to changes in
    engineering estimates is primarily due to a reduction of
    remaining airspace at the Countywide facility.



At December 31, 2007, 11.1% of our total available
    airspace, or 0.2 billion cubic yards, consisted of probable
    expansion airspace at eleven of our landfills. At
    December 31, 2010, 3.1% of our total available airspace, or
    0.1 billion cubic yards, consisted of probable expansion
    airspace at eight of our landfills. Between December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2010, we received permits for 19 of
    our probable expansions, which demonstrates our continued
    success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace.

As of December 31, 2010, eight of our landfills meet all of
    our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in
    their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual
    volumes, these landfills have an estimated remaining average
    site life of 48 years, including probable expansion
    airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our
    landfills is 55 years. We have other expansion
    opportunities that are not included in our total available
    airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for
    probable expansion airspace.

    our active landfill sites based on available and probable

Final
    Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

As of December 31, 2010, accrued final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs were $1,046.5 million, of which
    $93.9 million is current and $952.6 million is
    long-term as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in
    accrued landfill and environmental costs.

Remediation
    and Other Charges for Landfill Matters

In December 2009, we finalized our purchase price allocation for
    the environmental liabilities we assumed as part of the Allied
    acquisition. These liabilities represent our estimate of costs
    to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by
    Allied or sites at which Allied, or a predecessor company that
    it had acquired, had been identified as a potentially
    responsible party. The remediation of these sites is in various
    stages of completion from having received an initial notice from
    a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the
    final stages of post remedial monitoring. See also Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
    Environmental Remediation Liabilities,

for further
    information. We have recorded these liabilities at their
    estimated fair values using a discount rate of 9.75%. Discounted
    liabilities are accreted to interest expense through the period
    that they are paid.

The following is a discussion of certain of our significant
    remediation matters:

Countywide Landfill.

In September 2009, Republic
    Services of Ohio II, LLC entered into Final Findings and Orders
    with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency that require us to
    implement a comprehensive operation and maintenance program to
    manage the remediation area at the Countywide Recycling and
    Disposal Facility (Countywide). The remediation liability for
    Countywide recorded as of December 31, 2010 is
    $68.4 million, of which $7.1 million is expected to be
    paid during 2011. We believe the reasonably possible range of
    loss for remediation costs is $59 million to
    $81 million.



West Contra Costa County Landfill.

In 2006, we were
    issued an Enforcement Order by the California Department of
    Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) for the Class 1 Hazardous
    waste cell at the West Contra Costa County Landfill (West
    County). Subsequently, we entered into a Consent Agreement with
    DTSC in 2007 at which time we agreed to undertake certain
    remedial actions. The remediation liability for West County
    recorded as of December 31, 2010 is $46.5 million, of
    which $2.5 million is expected to be paid during 2011. We
    believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation
    costs is $36 million to $63 million.

Sunrise Landfill.

In August 2008, Republic Services
    of Southern Nevada (RSSN), signed a Consent Decree with the EPA,
    the Bureau of Land Management and Clark County, Nevada related
    to the Sunrise Landfill. Under the Consent Decree, RSSN has
    agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the Sunrise
    Landfill for which RSSN and Clark County were otherwise jointly
    and severally liable. We also paid $1.0 million in
    sanctions related to the Consent Decree. RSSN is currently
    working with the Clark County Staff and Board of Commissioners
    to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the
    Consent Decree. However, we have not recorded any potential
    recoveries. The remediation liability for Sunrise recorded as of
    December 31, 2010 is $37.5 million, of which
    $23.0 million is expected to be paid during 2011. We
    believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation
    costs is $29 million to $44 million.

Congress Landfill.

In August 2010, Congress
    Development Company agreed with the State of Illinois to have a
    Final Consent Order (Final Order) entered by the Circuit Court
    of Illinois, Cook County. Pursuant to the Final Order, we have
    agreed to continue to implement certain remedial activities at
    the Congress Landfill. The remediation liability recorded as of
    December 31, 2010 is $82.6 million, of which
    $8.4 million is expected to be paid during 2011. We believe
    the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is
    $46 million to $146 million.

It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the
    liabilities noted above to reflect the effects of new or
    additional information, to the extent that such information
    impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions.
    Future changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration
    of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, our average
    compaction rate was approximately 1,800 pounds per cubic yard
    based on our three-year historical moving average as compared to
    1,700 pounds per cubic yard for the year ended December 31,
    2009 based on our three-year historical moving average. Our
    compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and
    decomposition of waste.

As of December 31, 2010, we expect to spend an estimated
    additional $6.1 billion on existing landfills, primarily
    related to cell construction and environmental structures, over
    their expected remaining lives. Our total expected investment,
    excluding non-depletable land, estimated to be
    $9.3 billion, or $1.96 per cubic yard, is used in
    determining our depletion and amortization expense based on
    airspace consumed using the

units-of-consumption

method.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The major components of changes in cash flows for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are discussed in the
    following paragraphs. The following table summarizes our cash
    flow from operating activities, investing activities and
    financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008:

Cash
    Flows Provided by Operating Activities

Certain of the more significant items affecting the comparison
    of our operating cash flows for 2010 and 2009 are summarized
    below:

Earnings increase.

Our net income increased by
    $11.0 million on a

year-over-year

basis.

Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from
    business acquisitions and divestitures.

Changes in
    assets and liabilities decreased our cash flow from operations
    by $360.9 million in 2010 versus a decrease of
    $251.9 million in 2009, an increase of $109.0 million,
    primarily as a result of the following:

•

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded a tax receivable
    of approximately $70 million primarily due to the effects
    of current deductions for property placed into service during
    the fourth quarter, referred to as “Bonus
    Depreciation.” We expect a refund of approximately
    $50 million in the first quarter of 2011.

•

During 2010, we paid $161.8 million to settle capping,
    closure, post-closure and remediation obligations, an increase
    of $4.7 million from $157.1 million we paid in 2009.
    The increase in cash paid for capping, closure, post closure and
    remediation activities is primarily due to the timing of
    obligations.



•

During 2010, we paid $20.0 million for restructuring and
    synergy related costs incurred in connection with the
    restructuring plan related to the Allied acquisition, a decrease
    of $46.5 million from $66.5 million we paid in 2009.
    The decrease in cash expenditures is due to a decrease in
    restructuring and synergy plan activities in 2010.

•

During 2010, we made income tax payments (net of refunds
    received) of approximately $418 million, of which
    approximately $111 million related to the settlement of
    certain tax liabilities regarding BFI risk management companies.
    During 2009, we made income tax payments (net of refunds
    received) of approximately $444 million, of which
    approximately $105 million related to taxes on our
    divestitures.

•

Cash paid for interest was $53.8 million lower during 2010
    versus 2009 due to reductions in debt balances and refinancing
    of our higher interest rate debt in the second half of 2009 and
    throughout 2010.

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our
    operating cash flows for 2009 and 2008 are summarized below:

Earnings increase.

Our net income increased by
    $422.6 million on a

year-over-year

basis, primarily due to the Allied acquisition in December 2008,
    which positively affected our cash flow from operations in 2009.

Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from
    business acquisitions and divestitures.

Changes in
    assets and liabilities decreased our cash flow from operations
    by $251.9 million in 2009 versus a decrease of
    $78.9 million in 2008, primarily as a result of the
    following:

•

During 2009, the cash we paid to settle our capping, closure,
    post-closure and remediation obligations increased by
    $85.9 million. The increase in cash paid for capping,
    closure, post closure and remediation activities is primarily
    due to the Allied acquisition.

•

During 2009, we paid $66.5 million for restructuring and
    synergy related costs incurred in connection with the
    restructuring plan related to the Allied acquisition.

•

During 2009, we made income tax payments (net of refunds
    received) of approximately $444 million, of which
    approximately $105 million related to taxes on our
    divestitures. During 2008, we made income tax payments (net of
    refunds received) of approximately $128 million. During
    2008, approximately $32 million of federal tax payments
    were deferred and paid in 2009 as a result of the Allied
    acquisition.

Cash
    Flows Used in Investing Activities

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our
    investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized
    below:

Capital expenditures.

Capital expenditures during
    2010 were $794.7 million, compared with $826.3 million
    in 2009 and $386.9 million in 2008. Capital expenditures in
    2009 were higher than 2008 due to the Allied acquisition in
    December 2008. During 2011, we expect our capital expenditures
    to approximate $870 million. However, we expect property
    and equipment received during 2011 to be $750 million,
    which excludes $120 million of property and equipment
    received during 2010 but paid during 2011.

Proceeds from sales of property and
    equipment.

Proceeds on sale of property and equipment
    during 2010 were $37.4 million, compared with
    $31.8 million in 2009 and $8.2 million in 2008.
    Proceeds on sale of property and equipment in 2010 were higher
    than 2009 due to the sale of our former headquarters building in
    Florida. Proceeds on sale of property in 2009 were higher than
    2008 due to the Allied acquisition in December 2008.

Cash used in acquisitions and development projects, net of
    cash acquired.

During 2010, we paid $58.9 million
    for eight acquisitions, including a landfill development
    project. Cash paid for acquisitions in 2008 includes the
    retirement of Allied’s credit facility, net of cash
    acquired, and $13.4 million of cash paid for other
    acquisitions.



Proceeds from divestitures.

Proceeds from
    divestitures (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets
    were $60.0 million in 2010, $511.1 million in 2009 and
    $3.3 million in 2008. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, we received $60.0 million in cash
    proceeds, net of cash divested, primarily related to certain
    hauling and transfer station assets sold in our Eastern Region.
    Proceeds received in 2009 were primarily the result of divesting
    certain assets as required by the DOJ as a condition of the
    Allied acquisition.

Change in restricted cash and marketable
    securities.

Changes in our restricted cash and
    marketable securities balances, which are largely related to the
    issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs and amounts
    held in trust as a guarantee of performance, contributed
    $66.3 million and $41.6 million to our investing
    activities in 2010 and 2009 compared to a $5.3 million use
    of cash in 2008. Funds received from issuances of tax-exempt
    bonds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding
    authority at the time of issuance. As we do not have the ability
    to use these funds for general operating purposes, they are
    classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance
    sheets. Proceeds from bond issuances into restricted trust
    accounts represent cash used in investing activities in our
    consolidated statements of cash flows. Reimbursements from the
    trust for qualifying expenditures are presented as cash provided
    by investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash
    flows. During 2010 and 2009, our reimbursements from restricted
    cash accounts exceeded funds received from the issuance of
    tax-exempt bonds.

We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions
    through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital
    expenditures, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit
    facilities, and tax-exempt bonds and other financings. We expect
    to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions.

Cash
    Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash
    flows from financing activities for the periods presented are
    summarized:

Net debt repayments or borrowings.

Payments of notes
    payable and long-term debt net of proceeds from notes payable
    and long-term debt and issuance of senior notes were
    $397.4 million in 2010 versus $865.9 million in 2009
    and net borrowing of $712.8 million in 2008. During 2010 we
    issued $850.0 million of 5.00% senior notes due 2020
    and $650.0 million of 6.20% senior notes due 2040. We
    used the net proceeds from the Notes as follows:
    (i) $433.7 million to redeem the 6.125% senior
    notes due 2014 at a premium of 102.042% ($425.0 million
    principal outstanding); (ii) $621.8 million to redeem
    the 7.250% senior notes due 2015 at a premium of 103.625%
    ($600.0 million principal outstanding); and (iii) the
    remainder to reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit
    Facilities and for general corporate purposes. During 2010, we
    also we repaid all borrowings and terminated our accounts
    receivable securitization program and we refinanced
    $677.4 million and repaid $97.8 million of our
    tax-exempt financings.

During 2009, we issued $650.0 million of 5.500% Senior
    Notes due 2019 and $600.0 million of 5.250% Senior
    Notes due 2021. The primary use of proceeds from the notes
    together with draws on our Credit Facilities was to purchase and
    retire: (i) $325.5 million of varied senior notes
    maturing in 2010 and 2011 pursuant to our September 2009 tender
    offer; (ii) $450.0 million of 7.875% of Senior Notes
    due 2013; (iii) $400.0 million of 7.375% Senior
    Notes due 2014; (iv) $230.0 million of
    4.250% Senior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2034
    and; (v) repurchase certain of our senior notes maturing in
    2010 and 2011 in the secondary market. Additionally, our senior
    unsecured notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.125%
    matured during 2009. We repaid the remaining principal balance
    of $99.3 million in May 2009. Net borrowings reflected in
    our cash flows provided by financing activities in 2008 were
    primarily related to the Allied acquisition. We used proceeds
    from our revolver to refinance extensions of credit under
    Allied’s senior credit facility, to pay fees and expenses
    in connection therewith, and to pay fees and expenses incurred
    in connection with the acquisition.

Premiums and fees paid to issue and retire senior
    notes.

Cash premiums and fees paid in connection with
    the issuance of our 2020 and 2040 notes, premiums paid for note
    redemptions and fees paid to issue tax-exempt indebtedness were
    $56.6 million during 2010. In connection with the issuance
    of our senior notes as well as purchasing and retiring certain
    indebtedness in 2009, we incurred cash premiums and fees
    totaling $61.6 million.



Purchase of common stock for treasury.

From 2000
    through 2008, our board of directors authorized the repurchase
    of up to $2.6 billion of our common stock. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had paid $2.3 billion to
    repurchase 82.6 million shares of our common stock, of
    which $138.4 million was paid during 2008 to repurchase
    4.6 million shares. The stock repurchase program was
    suspended in the second quarter of 2008 due to the pending
    Allied acquisition. In November 2010, our board of directors
    approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may
    repurchase up to $400.0 million of our outstanding shares
    of common stock through December 31, 2011. As of
    December 31, 2010, we have repurchased 1.4 million
    shares for $41.1 million at a weighted average cost per
    share of $28.46. We expect to use the remaining funds under this
    program to repurchase shares during 2011.

Cash dividends paid.

We initiated a quarterly cash
    dividend in July 2003. The dividend has been increased from time
    to time thereafter. In July 2010, the board of directors
    approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.20 per
    share. Dividends paid were $294.6 million,
    $288.3 million and $128.3 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Financial
    Condition

As of December 31, 2010, we had $88.3 million of cash
    and cash equivalents, and $172.8 million of restricted cash
    deposits and restricted marketable securities, including
    $39.8 million of restricted cash held for capital
    expenditures under certain debt facilities.

Our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility due April 2012
    and our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility due
    September 2013 (collectively, Credit Facilities) bear interest
    at a Base Rate, or a Eurodollar Rate, plus an applicable margin
    based on our Debt Ratings (all as defined in the agreements). As
    of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the interest rate for our
    borrowings under our Credit Facilities was 1.56% and 1.62%,
    respectively. Our Credit Facilities are also subject to facility
    fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the
    aggregate commitments, regardless of usage. Availability under
    our Credit Facilities can be used for working capital, capital
    expenditures, letters of credit and other general corporate
    purposes. We had $75.0 million and $300.0 million of
    Eurodollar Rate borrowings and nil and $15.4 million of
    Base Rate borrowings as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. We had $1,037.5 million and
    $1,634.0 million of letters of credit utilizing
    availability under our Credit Facilities, leaving
    $1,637.5 million and $800.6 million of availability
    under our Credit Facilities at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

The agreements governing our Credit Facilities require us to
    comply with certain financial and other covenants. We can pay
    dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance
    with these covenants. Compliance with these covenants is a
    condition for any incremental borrowings under our Credit
    Facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the
    lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans (which
    would adversely affect our liquidity). At December 31,
    2010, our EBITDA to interest ratio was 4.64 compared to the 3.00
    minimum required by the covenants, and our total debt to EBITDA
    ratio was 2.85 compared to the 3.25 maximum allowed by the
    covenants. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with
    the covenants of the Credit Facilities, and we expect to be in
    compliance during 2011.

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as defined in
    our Credit Facility agreements. In this context, EBITDA is used
    solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we
    are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to
    EBITDA used by other companies or used by us for other purposes.

In March 2010, we issued $850.0 million of
    5.00% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and
    $650.0 million of 6.20% senior notes due 2040 (the
    2040 Notes, and, together with the 2020 Notes, the Notes). The
    Notes are general senior unsecured obligations and mature on
    March 1, 2020 (in the case of the 2020 Notes) and
    March 1, 2040 (in the case of the 2040 Notes). Interest is
    payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1, beginning
    September 1, 2010. The Notes are guaranteed by each of our
    subsidiaries that also guarantees our Credit Facilities. These
    guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of our
    subsidiary guarantors.

We used the net proceeds from the Notes as follows:
    (i) $433.7 million to redeem the 6.125% senior
    notes due 2014 at a premium of 102.042% ($425.0 million
    principal outstanding); (ii) $621.8 million to redeem
    the



7.250% senior notes due 2015 at a premium of 103.625%
    ($600.0 million principal outstanding); and (iii) the
    remainder to reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit
    Facilities and for general corporate purposes. We incurred a
    loss of $132.1 million for premiums paid to repurchase
    debt, charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional
    fees paid to effectuate the repurchase of the senior notes.

In March 2010, we repaid all borrowings and terminated our
    accounts receivable securitization program with two financial
    institutions that allowed us to borrow up to $300.0 million
    on a revolving basis under loan agreements secured by
    receivables. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of
    $0.2 million related to unamortized deferred issuance costs
    associated with terminating this program.

To manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates,
    we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with
    investment grade-rated financial institutions. Our outstanding
    swap agreements have a total notional value of
    $210.0 million and require us to pay interest at floating
    rates based on changes in LIBOR and receive interest at a fixed
    rate of 6.75%. Our swap agreements mature in August 2011.

At December 31, 2010, we had $1,151.8 million of
    tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings outstanding.
    Borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest
    based on fixed or floating interest rates at prevailing market
    rates ranging from 0.28% to 8.25% at December 31, 2010 and
    have maturities ranging from 2012 to 2035. As of
    December 31, 2010, we had $39.8 million of restricted
    cash related to proceeds from tax-exempt bonds and other
    tax-exempt financings. This restricted cash will be used to
    reimburse capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we refinanced
    $677.4 million and repaid $97.8 million of our
    tax-exempt financings resulting in a loss on extinguishment of
    debt of $28.5 million related to charges for unamortized
    debt discounts and professional fees paid to effectuate these
    transactions.

We intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating
    activities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend
    payments, share repurchases and debt repayments. Debt repayments
    may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the
    secondary market or otherwise. We believe that our excess cash,
    cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving
    credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources
    to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing
    obligations as they come due.

In the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain
    portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates
    using cash from operations or additional borrowings. We may also
    explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions
    should market conditions be favorable. Any early extinguishment
    of debt may result in an impairment charge in the period in
    which the debt is repurchased and retired. The loss on early
    extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate
    the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note
    discounts and debt issue costs.

Fuel
    Hedges

We use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to
    manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices. We have
    entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel
    fuel purchases. The agreements qualified for, and were
    designated as, effective hedges of changes in the prices of
    forecasted diesel fuel purchases (fuel hedges).

If the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon
    of diesel fuel (average price) as published by the Department of
    Energy exceeds the contract price per gallon, we receive the
    difference between the average price and the contract price
    (multiplied by the notional gallons) from the counter-party. If
    the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of
    diesel fuel is less than the contract price per gallon, we pay
    the difference to the counter-party.

The fair values of our fuel hedges are obtained from third-party
    counter-parties and are determined using standard option
    valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being
    based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in
    the fair value hierarchy). The aggregated fair values of the
    outstanding fuel hedges at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were
    current assets of $1.6 million and $3.2 million,
    respectively, and accrued liabilities of $1.9 million and
    $4.9 million, respectively, and have been recorded in other
    current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated
    balance sheets, respectively.

The effective portions of the changes in fair values as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, net of tax, of
    $0.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, have been
    recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portions
    of the changes in fair values as of December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008 were immaterial and have been recorded in other income
    (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income.
    Realized (losses) gains of $(2.0) million,
    $(7.3) million and $5.9 million related to these fuel
    hedges are included in cost of operations in our consolidated
    statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

During 2010, approximately 7% of our fuel volume purchases were
    hedged with swap agreements. Additionally, we were able to
    recover approximately 66% of our fuel costs with fuel recovery
    fees from certain of our customers.

Recycling
    Commodity Hedges

Revenue from sale of recycling commodities is primarily from
    sales of old corrugated cardboard (OCC) and old newspaper (ONP).
    We use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars
    designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes
    in prices of these commodities. We have entered into multiple
    agreements related to the forecasted OCC and ONP sales. The
    agreements qualified for, and were designated as, effective
    hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted commodity
    sales (commodity hedges).

If the price per short ton of the hedging instrument (average
    price) as reported on the Official Board Market is less than the
    contract price per short ton, we receive the difference between
    the average price and the contract price (multiplied by the
    notional short tons) from the counter-party. If the price of the
    commodity exceeds the contract price per short ton, we pay the
    difference to the counter-party.

The fair values of our commodity swaps are obtained from
    third-party counter-parties and are determined using standard
    option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices
    being based on those observed in underlying markets
    (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).

On December 8, 2010, we entered into a two-year costless
    collar agreement on forecasted sales of 10,000 short tons of OCC
    a month. The agreement involves combining a purchased put option
    giving us the right to sell 10,000 short tons of OCC monthly for
    24 months at an established floor strike price with a
    written call option obligating us to deliver 10,000 short tons
    of OCC monthly for 24 months at an established cap strike
    price. The puts and calls have the same settlement dates, are
    net settled in cash on such date and have the same terms to
    expiration. The contemporaneous combination of options resulted
    in no net premium for us and represents a costless collar. Under
    the agreement, we will not make or receive any payment, as long
    as the settlement price is between the floor price and cap
    price. However, if the settlement price is above the cap, we
    would be required to pay the counterparty an amount equal to the
    excess of the settlement price over the cap times the monthly
    volumes hedged. Also, if the settlement price is below the
    floor, the counterparty would be required to pay us the deficit
    of the settlement price below the floor times the monthly
    volumes hedged. The objective of this agreement is to reduce the
    variability of the cash flows of the forecasted sales of OCC
    between two designated strike prices.

The costless collar hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at
    fair value. The fair values of the costless collars are obtained
    from the third-party counter-party and are determined using
    standard option valuation models with assumptions about
    commodity prices based upon forward commodity price curves in
    underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).

The aggregated fair values of the outstanding commodity hedges
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were current assets of
    $1.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, and
    current liabilities of $6.5 million and $0.8 million,
    respectively, and have been recorded in other current assets and
    other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets,
    respectively.

The effective portions of the changes in fair values of our
    commodity hedges as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, net of
    tax, of $(2.6) million and $0.6 million have been
    recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portions
    of the changes in fair values as of December 31, 2010 and
    2009 were immaterial and have been recorded in other income
    (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income.

Approximately 20% of our 2010 tonnage sales volume of
    commodities were subject to cash flow hedges.

We intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating
    activities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend
    payments, share repurchases and debt repayments. Debt repayments
    may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the
    secondary market or otherwise. We believe that our excess cash,
    cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving
    credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources
    to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing
    obligations as they come due.

In the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain
    portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates
    using cash from operations or additional borrowings. We also may
    explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions
    should market conditions be favorable.

The present value of capital lease obligations is included in
    our consolidated balance sheets.

The estimated remaining final capping, closure and post-closure
    and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated
    and not discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for
    liabilities incurred and recorded as of December 31, 2010.

Unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of
    (i) disposal related agreements which include fixed or
    minimum royalty payments, host agreements and

take-or-pay

and

put-or-pay

agreements and (ii) other obligations including committed
    capital expenditures and consulting service agreements.

In addition to the above, we have unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2010 of $222.8 million. Due to the
    uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows
    associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at



December 31, 2010, we are unable to make reasonably
    reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements.

We also have letters of credit of $1.1 billion, of which
    $1.0 billion utilize availability under our Credit
    Facilities at December 31, 2010.

Debt
    covenants

Our Credit Facilities contain financial covenants. We can pay
    dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance
    with these covenants. At December 31, 2010, we were in
    compliance with all financial and other covenants under our
    Credit Facilities. We were also in compliance with the
    non-financial covenants in the indentures relating to our senior
    notes as of December 31, 2010. We expect to be in
    compliance with our covenants during 2011.

Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under
    our Credit Facilities, as well as the occurrence of certain
    material adverse events, would constitute defaults and would
    allow the lenders under our Credit Facilities to accelerate the
    maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements. This
    could also have an adverse impact on the availability of
    financial assurances. In addition, maturity acceleration on our
    Credit Facilities constitutes an event of default under our
    other debt instruments, including our senior notes, and,
    therefore, our senior notes would also be subject to
    acceleration of maturity. If such acceleration were to occur, we
    would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the
    indebtedness. We would likely have to seek an amendment under
    our Credit Facilities for relief from the financial covenants or
    repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or
    equity, or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend
    our Credit Facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such
    obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated.

Financial
    assurance

We must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and
    a variety of other entities under applicable environmental
    regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping,
    closure and post-closure costs, and related to our performance
    under certain collection, landfill and transfer station
    contracts. We satisfy these financial assurance requirements by
    providing surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies or
    trust deposits. The amount of the financial assurance
    requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs is
    determined by applicable state environmental regulations. The
    financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and
    post-closure costs may be associated with a portion of the
    landfill or the entire landfill. Generally, states will require
    a third-party engineering specialist to determine the estimated
    capping, closure and post-closure costs that are used to
    determine the required amount of financial assurance for a
    landfill. The amount of financial assurance required can, and
    generally will, differ from the obligation determined and
    recorded under U.S. GAAP. The amount of the financial
    assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by
    contract.

Additionally, we must provide financial assurance for our
    insurance program and collateral for certain performance
    obligations. We do not expect a material increase in financial
    assurance requirements during 2011, although the mix of
    financial assurance instruments may change.

These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of
    business and are not considered company indebtedness. Because we
    currently have no liability for these financial assurance
    instruments, they are not reflected in our consolidated balance
    sheets. However, we record capping, closure and post-closure
    liabilities and self-insurance liabilities as they are incurred.
    The underlying obligations of the financial assurance
    instruments, in excess of those already reflected in our
    consolidated balance sheets, would be recorded if it is probable
    that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations. We
    do not expect this to occur.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other
    than financial assurance instruments and operating leases, that
    are not classified as debt. We do not guarantee any third-party
    debt.



Free Cash
    Flow

We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP, as cash provided by operating
    activities less purchases of property and equipment, plus
    proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in
    our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Our free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 is calculated as follows (in millions):

Purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our
    consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the
    free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the
    period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and
    equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows
    to property and equipment received during the period for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows

The adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash
    and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements
    of cash flows.

We believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides
    useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by
    operating activities after expenditures for property and
    equipment received, plus proceeds from sales of property and
    equipment. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our
    financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in existing
    capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service,
    investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer
    base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade
    rating and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends and
    repurchasing common stock, and maintaining and improving our
    market position through business optimization. In addition, free
    cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation. The
    presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Free
    cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for
    discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain
    expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such
    as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our
    definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly
    titled measures presented by other companies.

Critical
    Accounting Judgments and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP and necessarily include certain
    estimates and judgments made by management. The following is a
    list of accounting policies



that we believe are the most critical in understanding our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows and that may require management to make subjective or
    complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.
    Such critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments are
    applicable to all of our operating segments.

We have noted examples of the residual accounting and business
    risks inherent in the accounting for these areas. Residual
    accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks
    that we face after the application of our policies and processes
    that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast.

Accounting
    for the Allied Acquisition

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase
    method of accounting. The purchase method of accounting requires
    that the purchase price paid for an acquisition be allocated to
    the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
    estimated fair values as of the effective date of the
    acquisition, with the excess of the purchase price over the net
    assets acquired being recorded as goodwill. The consolidated
    financial statements of the acquirer include the operating
    results of the acquired business from the date of the
    acquisition, and are not retroactively restated to include the
    historical position or the results of operations of the acquired
    business. These estimates are revised during the allocation
    period when the information necessary to finalize the fair value
    estimates is received and analyzed, or if information regarding
    contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify
    the assets and liabilities acquired.

We have completed valuing all of the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed in the Allied acquisition. Adjustments, if
    any, to our estimates of fair values and the resulting purchase
    price allocation in future periods will be reflected in our
    consolidated statement of income. The significant areas of
    accounting where estimates of fair values are reflected in our
    consolidated financial statements include landfills and other
    property and equipment, other intangible assets, landfill asset
    retirement obligations, legal and environmental reserves,
    self-insurance reserves, income taxes, other non-current assets
    and long-term obligations, and assets held for sale. Our
    consolidated financial statements also include our estimates of
    restructuring costs incurred through December 31, 2010, a
    portion of which will be paid in future periods.

Residual risks:

•

The residual risks identified below related to critical
    accounting judgments and estimates are relevant to the fair
    value estimation processes for acquisitions. For discussion of
    other significant residual risks inherent in the accounting for
    acquisitions, see Item 1A.

Risk Factors

.

Landfill
    Accounting

Landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are
    not discussed further herein.

Our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two
    categories, each of which requires accounting judgments and
    estimates:

•

Landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset.

•

Landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping, closure
    and post-closure liabilities which result in a corresponding
    landfill retirement asset.

Landfill Development Costs

We use life-cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of
    the site. In life-cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and
    construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based
    on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace.
    Obligations associated with final capping, closure and
    post-closure are also capitalized, and amortized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are
    developed at least annually by engineers.

Site permits.

In order to develop, construct and
    operate a landfill, we are required to obtain permits from
    various regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal
    levels. The permitting process requires an initial site study to
    determine whether the location is feasible for landfill
    operations. The initial studies are reviewed by



our environmental management group and then submitted to the
    regulatory agencies for approval. During the development stage
    we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection
    but prior to the receipt of all required permits if we believe
    that it is probable that the site will be permitted.

Residual risks:

•

Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause
    changes to the landfill site permitting process. These changes
    could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a
    landfill permit.

•

Studies performed could be inaccurate, which could result in the
    denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting
    assumptions. Conditions could exist that were not identified in
    the study, which may make the location not feasible for a
    landfill and could result in the denial of a permit. Denial or
    revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the
    landfill asset.

•

Actions by neighboring parties, private citizen groups or others
    to oppose our efforts to obtain, maintain or expand permits
    could result in denial, revocation or suspension of a permit,
    which could adversely impact the economic viability of the
    landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill. As
    a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit, improved
    technical information as a project progresses, or changes in the
    anticipated economics associated with a project, we may decide
    to reduce the scope of or abandon a project, which could result
    in an asset impairment.

Technical landfill design.

Upon receipt of initial
    regulatory approval, technical landfill designs are prepared.
    The technical designs, which include the detailed specifications
    to develop and construct all components of the landfill
    including the types and quantities of materials that will be
    required, are reviewed by our environmental management group.
    The technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies
    for approval. Upon approval of the technical designs, the
    regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the
    landfill.

Residual risks:

•

Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require
    changes in the landfill technical design. These changes could
    make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards.

•

Technical design requirements, as approved, may need
    modifications at some future point in time.

•

Technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in
    increased construction costs, difficulty in obtaining a permit
    or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill
    development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not
    appropriate.

Permitted and probable landfill disposal
    capacity.

Included in the technical designs are factors
    that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill.
    These factors include the area over which the landfill will be
    developed, such as the depth of excavation, the height of the
    landfill elevation and the angle of the side-slope construction.
    The disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic
    yards. This measurement of volume is then converted to a
    disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site-specific
    expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating
    life of the landfill.

Residual risks:

•

Estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of
    changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements.

•

The density of waste may vary due to variations in operating
    conditions, including waste compaction practices, site design,
    climate and the nature of the waste.

•

Capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is
    measured in tons. The number of tons per cubic yard varies by
    type of waste and our rate of compaction.

Development costs.

The types of costs that are
    detailed in the technical design specifications generally
    include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction
    of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas



collection systems and monitoring probes, installation of
    groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate
    management facilities and other costs associated with the
    development of the site. We review the adequacy of our cost
    estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with
    third-party bids or contractual arrangements, reviewing the
    changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness, and
    comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior
    period costs. These development costs, together with any costs
    incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill, including
    capitalized interest, are recorded to the landfill asset on the
    balance sheet as incurred.

Residual risk:

•

Actual future costs of construction materials and third-party
    labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of
    the availability of the required materials and labor. Technical
    designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions,
    regulatory changes or legislative changes.

Landfill development asset amortization.

In order to
    match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue
    generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill
    development asset over its operating life on a per-ton basis as
    waste is accepted at the landfill. The landfill asset is fully
    amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life. The
    per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill
    development asset net book value plus estimated future
    development costs (as described above) for the landfill by the
    landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity. The
    expected future development costs are not inflated or
    discounted, but rather expressed in nominal dollars. This rate
    is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at
    amortization expense for the period.

Amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of
    the landfill, including acquisition costs, which in turn is
    determined by geographic location and market values. We secure
    significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and
    value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value.
    Amortization rates are also influenced by site-specific
    engineering and cost factors.

Residual risk:

•

Changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal
    capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization
    rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively. An
    unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction
    in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability
    of the landfill and result in asset impairment.

On at least an annual basis, we update the estimates of future
    development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each
    landfill. These costs and disposal capacity estimates are
    reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually.
    Changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected
    prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are
    updated annually.

Landfill
    Asset Retirement Obligations

We have two types of retirement obligations related to
    landfills: (1) capping and (2) closure and
    post-closure.

Obligations associated with final capping activities that occur
    during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping
    event. Obligations related to closure and post-closure
    activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations
    are recognized on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the
    landfill. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the
    related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the

units-of-consumption

method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or
    the airspace consumed within the entire landfill, depending on
    the nature of the obligation. All obligations are initially
    measured at estimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a
    present value basis using an inflation rate and our
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect at the time the
    liabilities were incurred. Future costs for final capping,
    closure and post-closure are developed at least annually by
    engineers, and are inflated to future value using estimated
    future payment dates and inflation rate projections.



Landfill capping.

As individual areas within each
    landfill reach capacity, we are required to cap and close the
    areas in accordance with the landfill site permit. These
    requirements are detailed in the technical design of the
    landfill site process previously described.

Closure and post-closure.

Closure costs are costs
    incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste, but prior
    to being certified as closed. After the entire landfill site has
    reached capacity and is certified closed, we are required to
    maintain and monitor the site for a post-closure period, which
    generally extends for 30 years. Costs associated with
    closure and post-closure requirements generally include
    maintenance of the site and the monitoring of methane gas
    collection systems and groundwater systems, and other activities
    that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste. Costs
    associated with post-closure monitoring generally include
    groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports,
    third-party labor associated with gas system operations and
    maintenance, transportation and disposal of leachate, and
    erosion control costs related to the final cap.

The initial liabilities recorded as part of the Allied
    acquisition were recorded using provisional amounts based upon
    information available at that time. During 2009, we gathered and
    assessed new information obtained about the facts and
    circumstances surrounding our remediation sites, and as a result
    increased the fair value of our closure and post-closure
    reserves by $72.3 million. Any further adjustments to our
    reserves resulting in changes in estimate or settlements will be
    reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the periods
    in which such adjustments become known.

Landfill retirement obligation liabilities and
    assets.

Estimates of the total future costs required to
    cap, close and monitor the landfill as specified by each
    landfill permit are updated annually. The estimates include
    inflation, the specific timing of future cash outflows, and the
    anticipated waste flow into the capping events. Our cost
    estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an
    estimate of inflation, which is updated annually and is based
    upon the ten year average consumer price index (2.5% in both
    2010 and 2009).

The present value of the remaining capping costs for specific
    capping events and the remaining closure and post-closure costs
    for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a per-ton basis.
    These liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed
    at the landfill.

Capping, closure and post-closure liabilities are recorded in
    layers and discounted using our credit-adjusted risk-free rate
    in effect at the time the obligation is incurred (5.5% in 2010
    and 7.5% in 2009).

Retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the
    passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average
    credit-adjusted risk-free rate that was used to calculate each
    layer of the recorded liabilities. This accretion is charged to
    operating expenses. Actual cash expenditures reduce the asset
    retirement obligation liabilities as they are made.

Corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the
    same value as the additions to the capping, closure and
    post-closure liabilities. The retirement obligation assets are
    amortized to expense on a per-ton basis as disposal capacity is
    consumed. The per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of
    each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book
    value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation
    asset by the remaining disposal capacity. A per-ton rate is
    determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal
    capacity relating to that event. Closure and post-closure
    per-ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the
    landfill.

Residual risks:

•

Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, including
    changes in capping, closure activities or post-closure
    monitoring activities, types and quantities of materials used,
    or term of post-closure care, could cause changes in our cost
    estimates.

•

Changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in
    the anticipated waste flow, changes in airspace compaction
    estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed
    landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are
    recorded in results of operations prospectively. This could
    result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense.



•

Actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from
    projected timing, causing differences in timing of when
    amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping,
    closure and post-closure liabilities.

•

Changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs
    and our total liabilities.

•

Changes in our capital structure or market conditions could
    result in changes to the credit-adjusted risk-free rate used to
    discount the liabilities, which could cause changes in future
    recorded liabilities, assets and expense.

•

Amortization rates could change in the future based on the
    evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill
    capping design, post-closure monitoring requirements, or the
    inflation or discount rate.

On an annual basis, we update our estimates of future capping,
    closure and post-closure costs and of future disposal capacity
    for each landfill. Revisions in estimates of our costs or timing
    of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or
    decreases to the capping, closure and post-closure liabilities
    and the corresponding retirement obligation assets. Changes in
    the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are
    applied prospectively, except for fully incurred capping events
    and closed landfills, where the changes are recorded immediately
    in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity
    has already been consumed.

In connection with the 2008 annual review of our calculations
    with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations, we made a
    change in estimate, which is considered to be a change in
    accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting
    principle. This change, which we believe is preferable, was made
    to better align the estimated amount of waste placed in an area
    to be capped (which is used to calculate our capping rates) with
    the physical operation of our landfills. The expected costs
    related to our capping events did not change and we will
    continue to use separate rates for each capping event. This
    change resulted in a $32.6 million decrease in our capping
    asset retirement obligations and related assets. These assets
    will be amortized to expense prospectively as a change in
    estimate. This change in estimate will not have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Permitted and probable disposal capacity.

As
    described previously, disposal capacity is determined by the
    specifications detailed in the landfill permit. We classify this
    disposal capacity as permitted. We also include probable
    expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity
    estimates, thus including additional disposal capacity being
    sought through means of a permit expansion. Probable expansion
    disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the
    applicable regulatory agencies, but we have determined that
    certain critical criteria have been met and the successful
    completion of the expansion is probable. We have developed six
    criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated
    as probable expansion airspace. We believe that satisfying all
    of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion
    airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be
    permitted. However, because some of these criteria are
    judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will
    eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will
    not be permitted. In either of these scenarios, our
    amortization, depletion and accretion expense could change
    significantly. Our internal criteria to classify disposal
    capacity as probable expansion are as follows:

•

We own the land associated with the expansion airspace or
    control it pursuant to an option agreement;

•

We are committed to supporting the expansion project financially
    and with appropriate resources;

•

There are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated
    with the project, including political impediments;

•

Progress is being made on the project;

•

The expansion is attainable within a reasonable time
    frame; and

•

We believe it is likely the expansion permit will be received.

After successfully meeting these criteria, the disposal capacity
    that will result from the planned expansion is included in our
    remaining disposal capacity estimates. Additionally, for
    purposes of calculating landfill



amortization and capping, closure and post-closure rates, we
    include the incremental costs to develop, construct, close and
    monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity.

Residual risk:

•

We may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable
    expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the
    final local, state or federal permits or due to other unknown
    reasons. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for
    probable expansion disposal capacity, or the disposal capacity
    for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated,
    both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be
    reduced, which generally increases the rates we charge for
    landfill amortization and capping, closure and post-closure
    accruals. An unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also
    cause an asset impairment.

Environmental
    Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to
    the protection of the environment, and we remediate sites in the
    ordinary course of our business. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation
    at sites that we either own or operate, including sites that we
    have acquired, or sites where we have (or a company that we have
    acquired has) delivered waste. Our environmental remediation
    liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating
    groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as
    controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related
    legal costs. To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites,
    we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of
    contamination at each identified site, the required remediation
    methods, the apportionment of responsibility among the
    potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of
    those parties. We accrue for costs associated with environmental
    remediation obligations when such costs are probable and
    reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss
    contingencies. We periodically review the status of all
    environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood
    of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary. Changes
    in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized
    currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is
    known. Adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the
    near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts. We have
    not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from
    other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies.

The environmental liabilities assumed from Allied relate to
    impacts at both owned and unowned sites. In the case of owned
    sites, we are actively working with the appropriate regulatory
    entity under the applicable regulations (typically RCRA or
    CERCLA) to characterize and remediate potential issues. At
    unowned sites, we are working within the regulatory and
    procedural framework established by CERCLA to characterize and
    remediate potential issues, in conjunction with other
    potentially liable parties at each location. Pursuant to the
    purchase method of accounting, we have recorded the
    environmental remediation liabilities assumed from Allied based
    upon estimates of their fair value, using an estimate of future
    cash flows or settlement. Previously, and consistent with our
    method of accounting, Allied recorded remediation liabilities
    based upon accounting for loss contingencies, however, amounts
    recorded under this method are generally not at fair value.

Since the date of acquisition, our process for deriving fair
    value for the environmental liabilities assumed from Allied
    included first identifying the population of remediation sites
    where we are either fully or partially responsible for
    remediation or potential remediation. The population of
    remediation sites was then stratified into categories based on
    (i) the maturity of the issue relative to recognized stages
    in the applicable regulation (typically CERCLA or RCRA) and
    (ii) the extent of our participation in the remediation
    activity. Using these categories, we applied one of the
    following multiple estimation processes to quantify fair value:

•

For sites with established responsibility but a high level of
    uncertainty with the outcome of the remedial process, we
    developed multiple remediation scenarios. We then probability
    weighted the remediation scenarios to develop a fair value
    estimate.

•

For sites where the level of responsibility was less defined, we
    developed a fair value estimate of the settlement costs based
    upon market participant assessments from external legal counsel.



•

For sites which we own and are in the earliest stages of the
    remedial process, we identified the most applicable standard
    remedial techniques and then probability weighted the use of
    each technique to develop a fair value estimate.

•

For the remaining sites with low levels of uncertainty, we
    developed a primary remedial strategy and cost estimate to
    determine the fair value of the liability.

The initial liabilities recorded as part of the Allied
    acquisition were recorded using provisional amounts based upon
    information available at that time. During 2009, we gathered and
    assessed new information obtained about the facts and
    circumstances surrounding Allied’s remediation sites. In
    certain situations, we used external engineers and attorneys to
    assist in the development of our fair value estimates. As a
    result of the process, we increased the fair value of our
    remediation reserves by $181.9 million. Any further
    adjustments to our remediation reserves resulting from changes
    in estimates or reserve settlements will be reflected currently
    in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments become
    known.

We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our
    environmental remediation liabilities. Our estimates of these
    liabilities require assumptions about future events that are
    uncertain. Consequently, our estimates could change
    substantially as additional information becomes available
    regarding the nature or extent of contamination, the required
    remediation methods, the final apportionment of responsibility
    among the potentially responsible parties identified, the
    financial viability of those parties, and the actions of
    governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the
    matter.

•

Actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a
    result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue
    the matter to ultimate resolution.

•

An unanticipated environmental liability that arises could
    result in a material charge to our consolidated statement of
    income.

Self-Insurance
    Reserves and Related Costs

Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. Accruals for
    self-insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates
    of claims incurred but not reported. We maintain high
    deductibles for commercial general liability, automobile
    liability and workers’ compensation coverage, ranging from
    $1.0 million to $3.0 million.

Residual risks:

•

Incident rates, including frequency and severity, and other
    actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and
    future actuarially determined obligations to change, which would
    be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the
    period in which such adjustment is known.

•

It is possible that recorded reserves may not be adequate to
    cover the future payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to
    estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments would
    be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the
    periods in which such adjustments are known.

•

The settlement costs to discharge our obligations, including
    legal and health care costs, could increase or decrease causing
    current estimates of our self-insurance reserves to change.

Loss
    Contingencies

We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and
    regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to
    significant uncertainty. We determine whether to disclose or
    accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether
    the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable, and
    whether it can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our
    litigation and regulatory matters based on available information
    to assess the potential liabilities. Management’s
    assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible
    outcomes under various strategies. We record and disclose loss
    contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for
    such matter.



We record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations
    or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on
    the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss
    contingency.

Residual risks:

•

Actual costs may vary from our estimates for a variety of
    reasons, including differing interpretations of laws, opinions
    on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages.

•

Loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are
    inherently subjective and generally involve business matters
    that are by their nature unpredictable. If a loss contingency
    results in an adverse judgment or is settled for a significant
    amount, it could have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, result of operations or cash
    flows in the period in which such judgment or settlement occurs.

Asset
    Impairment

Valuation methodology.

We evaluate our long-lived
    assets (other than goodwill) for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
    asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected
    cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing
    operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise
    dispose of the assets.

Residual risk:

•

If events or changes in circumstances occur, including
    reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations
    or determinations to divest assets, certain assets could be
    impaired which would result in a non-cash charge to earnings.

Evaluation criteria.

We test long-lived assets for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.
    Examples of such events could include a significant adverse
    change in the extent or manner in which we use a long-lived
    asset, a change in its physical condition, or new circumstances
    that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not
    that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long-lived asset
    significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
    life.

Residual risk:

•

Our most significant asset impairment exposure, other than
    goodwill (which is discussed below) relates to our landfills. A
    significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a
    result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments,
    revocation of an existing permit or denial of an expansion
    permit, or changes in our assumptions used to calculate disposal
    capacity, could trigger an impairment charge.

Recognition criteria.

If such circumstances arise,
    we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying
    amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the
    asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows
    expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. We
    generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from
    that asset to determine fair value.

Goodwill
    Recoverability

We annually test goodwill for impairment at December 31 or when
    an indicator of impairment exists. We test goodwill for
    impairment using the two-step process. The first step is a
    screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures
    the amount of the impairment, if any. The first step of the
    goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting
    unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.

We have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our
    operating segments: Eastern, Midwestern, Southern, and Western.
    In determining fair value, we primarily utilize discounted
    future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative
    multiple of earnings or revenues.



Significant estimates used in our fair value calculation
    utilizing discounted future cash flows include, but are not
    limited to: (i) estimates of future revenue and expense
    growth by reporting unit, which we estimate to range from 3% to
    5%; (ii) future estimated effective tax rates, which we
    estimate to be 40%; (iii) future estimated capital
    expenditures as well as future required investments in working
    capital; (iv) estimated discount rates, which we estimate
    to range between 8% and 10%; and (v) the future terminal
    value of the reporting unit, which is based on its ability to
    exist into perpetuity. Significant estimates used in the fair
    value calculation utilizing market value multiples include but
    are not limited to: (i) estimated future growth potential
    of the reporting unit; (ii) estimated multiples of revenue
    or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay; and
    (iii) estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely
    to pay.

In addition, we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if
    events or circumstances change between annual tests, indicating
    a possible impairment. Examples of such events or circumstances
    include: (i) a significant adverse change in legal factors
    or in the business climate; (ii) an adverse action or
    assessment by a regulator; (iii) a more likely than not
    expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion
    thereof will be sold; (iv) continued or sustained losses at
    a reporting unit; (v) a significant decline in our market
    capitalization as compared to our book value; or (vi) the
    testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within
    the reporting unit.

We assign assets and liabilities from our corporate reporting
    segment to our four operating segments to the extent that such
    assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting
    unit and would be included in determining the reporting
    unit’s fair value.

In preparing our annual test for impairment as of
    December 31, 2010, we determined that our indicated fair
    value of equity exceeded our market capitalization. We
    determined market capitalization as the fair value of our common
    shares outstanding at the closing market price on
    December 31, 2010. We believe one of the primary
    reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of
    equity and our market capitalization is due to a control
    premium. We believe the control premium represents the value a
    market participant could extract as savings and / or
    synergies by obtaining control, and thereby eliminating
    duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting from the
    consolidation of routes and internalization of waste streams.

As of December 31, 2010, we determined that the indicated
    fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value
    by a range of 120% to in excess of 170% and, as such, we noted
    no indicators of impairment at our reporting units.

We will continuously monitor market trends in our business, the
    related expected cash flows and our calculation of market
    capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators
    of impairment. If our book value per share exceeds our market
    price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment, we
    will be required to perform an interim step one impairment
    analysis, which may lead to a step two analysis and possible
    impairment of our goodwill. Additionally, we would then be
    required to review our remaining long-lived assets for
    impairment.

Our operating segments, which also represent our reporting
    units, are comprised of several vertically integrated
    businesses. When an individual business within an integrated
    operating segment is divested, goodwill is allocated to that
    business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of
    its operating segment.

Residual risks:

•

Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment
    indicators exist and that goodwill associated with acquired
    businesses is impaired.

•

The valuation of identifiable goodwill requires significant
    estimates and judgment about future performance, cash flows and
    fair value. Our future results could be affected if these
    current estimates of future performance and fair value change.
    For example, a reduction in long-term growth assumptions could
    reduce the estimated fair value of the operating segments to
    below their carrying values, which could trigger an impairment
    charge. Similarly, an increase in our discount rate could
    trigger an impairment charge. Any resulting impairment charge
    could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition
    and results of operations.



Income
    Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
    differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases
    of assets (other than non-deductible goodwill) and liabilities.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the
    income tax rate in effect during the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse.

We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these
    assets will more likely than not be realized. In making this
    determination, we consider all available positive and negative
    evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax
    liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning
    strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we
    determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income
    tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount,
    we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which
    would reduce our provision for income taxes.

Regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized in the financial statements, we record a tax benefit
    from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not
    that the position will be sustained upon examination, including
    resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes,
    based on the technical merits. We recognize interest and
    penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the
    provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of
    income. Accrued interest and penalties are included within other
    accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other
    long-term tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

Residual risks:

•

Income tax assets and liabilities established in purchase
    accounting for acquisitions are based on assumptions that could
    differ from the ultimate outcome of the tax matters. Such
    adjustments would be charged or credited to earnings, unless
    they meet certain remeasurement criteria and are allowed to be
    adjusted to goodwill.

•

Changes in the estimated realizability of deferred tax assets
    could result in adjustments to our provision for income taxes.

•

Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the
    realizability of net operating loss carryforwards for tax
    purposes are based on our judgment. If our judgments and
    estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability
    of net operating loss carryforwards are incorrect, our provision
    for income taxes would change.

•

We are currently under examination or administrative review by
    various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax
    years. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and income tax
    regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to
    interpret and apply. Positions taken in tax years under
    examination or subsequent years are subject to challenge.
    Accordingly, we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities
    arising from these audits if any positions taken by us or by
    companies we have acquired are disallowed by the taxing
    authorities.

•

We adjust our liabilities for uncertain tax positions when our
    judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new
    information not previously available. Due to the complexity of
    some of these uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may
    result in payments that are materially different from our
    current estimates of the tax liabilities. These differences will
    be reflected as increases or decreases to our provision for
    income taxes in the period in which they are determined.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans

We currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan,
    the BFI Retirement Plan (the Plan). The Plan covers certain
    employees in the United States, including some employees subject
    to collective bargaining agreements. The Plan’s benefit
    formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in
    the Plan document. The benefits of approximately 97% of the
    current plan participants were frozen upon Allied’s
    acquisition of BFI in 1999.



Our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding
    standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security
    Act of 1974 and IRC, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of
    2006.

The Plan’s assets are invested as determined by our
    Retirement Benefits Committee. At December 31, 2010, the
    plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds, equity
    funds and cash. We annually review and adjust the plan’s
    asset allocation as deemed necessary. Our unfunded benefit
    obligation for the Plan was $7.7 million as of
    December 31, 2010 compared to $31.4 million as of
    December 31, 2009.

Residual risk:

•

Changes in the plan’s investment mix and performance of the
    equity and bond markets and fund managers could impact the
    amount of pension income or expense recorded, the funded status
    of the plan and the need for future cash contributions.

Assumptions.

The benefit obligation and associated
    income or expense related to the Plan are determined based on
    assumptions concerning items such as discount rates, expected
    rates of return and average rates of compensation increases. Our
    assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed
    necessary.

We determine the discount rate based on a model which matches
    the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities
    of high quality bonds priced as of the Plan measurement date.
    Where that timing does not correspond to a published
    high-quality bond rate, our model uses an expected yield curve
    to determine an appropriate current discount rate. The yield on
    the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability.
    If the discount rate were to increase by 1%, our benefit
    obligation would decrease by approximately $33 million. If
    the discount rate were to decrease by 1%, our benefit obligation
    would increase by approximately $39 million.

In developing our expected rate of return assumption, we
    evaluate long-term expected and historical returns on the Plan
    assets, giving consideration to our asset mix and the
    anticipated duration of the Plan obligations. The average rate
    of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average
    pay increases over the periods benefits are earned. Less than 3%
    of participants in the Plan continue to earn service benefits.

Residual risks:

•

Our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in
    market-based interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate
    will increase our related benefit plan obligation.

•

Our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual
    return on plan assets were to vary from the expected return.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is
    changing interest rates in the United States and fluctuations in
    LIBOR. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of
    a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. The carrying
    value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because
    interest rates are variable and, accordingly, approximates
    current market rates for instruments with similar risk and
    maturities. The fair value of our debt is determined as of the
    balance sheet date and is subject to change. The



table below provides information about certain of our
    market-sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a

    value related to hedging transactions and adjustments to fair
    value recorded in purchase accounting totaling
    $274.0 million.

Fuel
    Price Risk

Fuel costs represent a significant operating expense. When
    economically practical, we may enter into new or renew
    contracts, or engage in other strategies to mitigate market
    risk. Where appropriate, we have implemented a fuel recovery fee
    that is designed to recover our fuel costs. While we charge
    these fees to a majority of our customers, we are unable to
    charge such fees to all customers. Consequently, an increase in
    fuel costs results in (1) an increase in our cost of
    operations, (2) a smaller increase in our revenue (from the
    fuel recovery fee) and (3) a decrease in our operating
    margin percentage, because the increase in revenue is more than
    offset by the increase in cost. Conversely, a decrease in fuel
    costs results in (1) a decrease in our cost of operations,
    (2) a smaller decrease in our revenue and (3) an
    increase in our operating margin percentage.

At our current consumption levels, a one-cent change in the
    price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately
    $1.5 million on an annual basis, which would be partially
    offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to
    our customers. Accordingly, a substantial rise or drop in fuel
    costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost
    of operations.

Our operations also require the use of certain
    petrochemical-based products (such as liners at our landfills)
    whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals. An
    increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost
    of those products, which would increase our operating and
    capital costs. We are also susceptible to increases in indirect
    fuel surcharges from our vendors.

Commodities
    Prices

We market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from
    our material recycling facilities. As a result, changes in the
    market prices of these items will impact our results of
    operations. Revenue from sales of these products in 2010, 2009
    and 2008 were approximately $307.1 million,
    $181.2 million and $121.1 million, respectively.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Republic Services,
    Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Republic Services, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
    31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of
    the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
    an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Republic Services, Inc. at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Republic Services, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Republic Services,
    Inc.:

We have audited Republic Services, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Republic Services,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of
    Management on Republic Services, Inc.’s Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Republic Services, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Republic Services, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended December 31, 2010 of Republic Services,
    Inc. and our report dated February 18, 2011 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION

Republic Services, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and its
    subsidiaries (also referred to collectively as Republic, we, us,
    our, or the Company in this report) is the second largest
    provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer,
    recycling and disposal services in the United States, as
    measured by revenue. We manage and evaluate our operations
    through four geographic regions – Eastern, Midwestern,
    Southern, and Western, which we have identified as our
    reportable segments. We acquired Allied Waste Industries, Inc.
    (Allied) on December 5, 2008, and have included all of the
    operating results of Allied starting on that date in our
    consolidated financial statements. See Note 3,

Business
    Acquisitions and Divestitures and Restructuring Charges,

for
    additional information.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Republic, its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (U.S. GAAP). We account for
    investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling
    financial interest under either the equity method or cost method
    of accounting, as appropriate. Our investments in variable
    interest entities are not material to our consolidated financial
    statements. All material intercompany accounts and transactions
    have been eliminated in consolidation.

For comparative purposes, certain prior year amounts have been
    reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. All
    amounts are in millions, except per share amounts and unless
    otherwise noted.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Management’s
    Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
    estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting,
    recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities,
    stockholders’ equity, revenue and expenses. We must make
    these estimates and assumptions because certain information that
    we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with
    a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot
    be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies.
    In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to
    determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In
    preparing our financial statements, the most difficult,
    subjective and complex estimates and assumptions that deal with
    the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for
    our long-lived assets, landfill development costs, and final
    capping, closure and post-closure costs, our valuation
    allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets, our
    liabilities for potential litigation, claims and assessments,
    our liabilities for environmental remediation, employee benefit
    plans, deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions and
    self-insurance, and our estimates of the fair values of the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition. Each
    of these items is discussed in more detail in the following
    discussion. Our actual results may differ significantly from our
    estimates.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

We consider liquid investments with an original maturity at the
    date of acquisition of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents.

We may have net book credit balances in our primary disbursement
    accounts at the end of a reporting period. We classify such
    credit balances as accounts payable in our consolidated balance
    sheets as checks presented for payment to these accounts are not
    payable by our banks under overdraft arrangements, and, as such,
    do not represent short-term borrowings. As of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, there were net book credit balances of
    $94.8 million and $89.9 million in our primary
    disbursement accounts which were reclassified as accounts
    payable on our consolidated balance sheets.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash
    equivalents, trade accounts receivable and derivative
    instruments. We place our cash and cash equivalents with high
    quality financial institutions. Such balances may be in excess
    of FDIC insured limits. To manage the related credit exposure,
    we continually monitor the credit worthiness of the financial
    institutions where we have deposits. Concentrations of credit
    risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due
    to the wide variety of customers and markets in which we provide
    services, as well as the dispersion of our operations across
    many geographic areas. We provide services to commercial,
    industrial, municipal and residential customers in the United
    States and Puerto Rico. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of
    our customers, but do not require collateral to support customer
    receivables. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts
    based on various factors including the credit risk of specific
    customers, age of receivables outstanding, historical trends,
    economic conditions and other information. No customer exceeded
    5% of our outstanding accounts receivable balance at
    December 31, 2010 or 2009.

Accounts
    Receivable, Net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable represent receivables from customers for
    collection, transfer, recycling, disposal and other services.
    Our receivables are recorded when billed or when the related
    revenue is earned, if earlier, and represent claims against
    third parties that will be settled in cash. The carrying value
    of our receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts,
    represents their estimated net realizable value. Provisions for
    doubtful accounts are evaluated on a monthly basis and are
    recorded based on our historical collection experience, the age
    of the receivables, specific customer information and economic
    conditions. We also review outstanding balances on an
    account-specific basis. In general, reserves are provided for
    accounts receivable in excess of ninety days old. Past due
    receivable balances are written-off when our collection efforts
    have been unsuccessful in collecting amounts due.

The following table reflects the activity in our allowance for
    doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008:

In 2008, subsequent to the Allied acquisition, we recorded a
    provision for doubtful accounts of $14.2 million to adjust
    the allowance acquired from Allied to conform to Republic’s
    accounting policies. We also recorded $5.4 million to
    provide for specific bankruptcy exposures in 2008.

Restricted
    Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities

As of December 31, 2010, we had $172.8 million of
    restricted cash and restricted marketable securities. We obtain
    funds through the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for the purpose
    of financing qualifying expenditures at our landfills, transfer
    stations, and collection and recycling facilities. The funds are
    deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding
    authorities at the time of issuance. As the use of these funds
    is contractually restricted, and we do not have the ability to
    use these funds for general operating purposes, they are
    classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets.

In the normal course of business, we may be required to provide
    financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of
    other entities in connection with municipal residential
    collection contracts, closure or post-



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

closure of landfills, environmental remediation, environmental
    permits, and business licenses and permits as a financial
    guarantee of our performance. At several of our landfills, we
    satisfy financial assurance requirements by depositing cash into
    restricted trust funds or escrow accounts.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for
    major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized,
    while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
    incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the
    related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
    accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the
    consolidated statements of income.

We revise the estimated useful lives of property and equipment
    acquired through business acquisitions to conform with our
    policies. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful
    lives of the assets involved using the straight-line method. We
    assume no salvage value for our depreciable property and
    equipment.

The
    estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are as
    follows:

Estimated

Useful

Lives

Buildings and improvements

7 - 40 years

Vehicles

5 - 12 years

Landfill equipment

7 - 10 years

Other equipment

3 - 15 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 - 12 years

Landfill development costs are also included in property and
    equipment. Landfill development costs include direct costs
    incurred to obtain landfill permits and direct costs incurred to
    acquire, construct and develop sites as well as final capping,
    closure and post-closure assets. These costs are amortized or
    depleted based on consumed airspace. All indirect landfill
    development costs are expensed as incurred. (For additional
    information, see Note 8,

Landfill and Environmental
    Costs.

)

Capitalized
    Interest

We capitalize interest on landfill cell construction and other
    construction projects if they meet the following criteria:

1.  Total construction costs are $50,000 or greater,

2.  The construction phase is one month or
    longer, and

3.  The assets have a useful life of one year or
    longer.

Interest is capitalized on qualified assets while they undergo
    activities to ready them for their intended use. Capitalization
    of interest ceases once an asset is placed into service or if
    construction activity is suspended for more than a brief period
    of time. Our interest capitalization rate is based on our
    weighted average cost of indebtedness. Interest capitalized was
    $6.3 million, $7.8 million and $2.6 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents,
    restricted cash and marketable securities, accounts receivable,
    accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt and the
    assets in our defined benefit plan. The

fair value hierarchy under U.S. GAAP distinguishes between
    assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an
    entity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The
    hierarchy consists of three levels:

•

Level one – Quoted market prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities;

•

Level two – Inputs other than level one inputs that
    are either directly or indirectly observable; and

•

Level three – Unobservable inputs developed using
    estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting
    entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant
    would use.

We have determined the estimated fair values of our financial
    instruments using available market information and commonly
    accepted valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment
    is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates
    of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not necessarily
    indicative of the amounts that we, or holders of the
    instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use
    of different assumptions or valuation methodologies could have a
    material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The fair
    value estimates are based on information available as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. These amounts have not been
    revalued since those dates, and current estimates of fair value
    could differ significantly from the amounts presented.

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash
    and marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable
    and accrued liabilities approximate their respective fair values
    due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. See
    Note 9,

Debt

, and Note 15,

Financial
    Instruments

, for the fair value disclosures related to our
    long-term debt and financial instruments, respectively.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments to manage our risk
    associated with changing interest rates and changing prices for
    commodities we frequently purchase or sell by creating
    offsetting market exposures. We use interest rate swap
    agreements to manage risk associated with fluctuations in
    interest rates. We have entered into multiple agreements
    designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate some of our exposure
    to changes in diesel fuel prices and prices of certain
    commodities.

All derivatives are measured at fair value and recognized in the
    balance sheet as assets or liabilities, as appropriate. For
    derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair
    value of the effective portions of derivative instruments are
    reported in stockholders’ equity as components of other
    comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or
    is not probable of occurring. When the forecasted transaction
    occurs or is not probable of occurring, the realized net gain or
    loss is then recognized in the consolidated statements of
    income. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of
    derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings.

The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements and the
    fair values of our diesel fuel and other commodity hedges are
    obtained from third-party counter-parties and are determined
    using standard valuation models with assumptions about prices
    and other relevant information based on those observed in the
    underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).
    The estimated fair values of derivatives used to hedge risks
    fluctuate over time and should be viewed in relation to the
    underlying hedged transactions.

Landfill
    and Environmental Costs

Life
    Cycle Accounting

We use life-cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the
    site. In life cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and
    construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based
    on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace.

Costs and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by
    engineers. We use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to
    deplete capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily
    relate to changes in available



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in
    available airspace include but are not limited to changes due to
    the addition of airspace lying in probable expansion areas,
    airspace consumed and changes in engineering estimates.

Probable
    Expansion Airspace

We classify landfill disposal capacity as either permitted
    (having received the final permit from the applicable regulatory
    agency) or as probable expansion airspace. Before airspace
    included in an expansion area is determined to be probable
    expansion airspace and, therefore, is included in our
    calculation of total available disposal capacity, all of the
    following criteria must be met:

•

We own the land associated with the expansion airspace or
    control it pursuant to an option agreement,

•

We are committed to supporting the expansion project financially
    and with appropriate resources,

•

There are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated
    with the project, including political impediments,

•

Progress is being made on the project,

•

The expansion is attainable within a reasonable time
    frame, and

•

We believe it is likely the expansion permit will be received.

Upon meeting our expansion criteria, the rates used at each
    applicable landfill to expense costs to acquire, construct, cap,
    close and maintain a site during the post-closure period are
    adjusted to include both the probable expansion airspace and the
    additional costs to be capitalized or accrued associated with
    that expansion airspace.

We have identified three steps that landfills generally follow
    to obtain expansion permits. These steps are as follows:

1.  Obtaining approval from local authorities,

2.  Submitting a permit application to state
    authorities, and

3.  Obtaining permit approval from state authorities.

We continually monitor our progress toward obtaining permits for
    each of our sites with probable airspace. If we determine that a
    landfill expansion area no longer meets our criteria, the
    probable expansion airspace is removed from the landfill’s
    total available capacity and the rates used at the landfill to
    deplete costs to acquire, construct, cap, close and maintain a
    site during the post-closure period are adjusted accordingly. In
    addition, any amounts capitalized for the probable expansion
    airspace are charged to expense in the period in which it is
    determined that the criteria are no longer met.

Capitalized
    Landfill Costs

Capitalized landfill costs include expenditures for land,
    permitting, cell construction and environmental structures.
    Capitalized permitting and cell construction costs are limited
    to direct costs relating to these activities, including legal,
    engineering and construction costs associated with excavation,
    natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate
    collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and
    monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells
    and other costs associated with the development of the site.
    Interest is capitalized on landfill construction projects while
    the assets are undergoing activities to ready them for their
    intended use. Capitalized landfill costs also include final
    capping, closure and post-closure assets and are depleted as
    airspace is consumed using the

units-of-consumption

method.

Costs related to acquiring land, excluding the estimated
    residual value of unpermitted, non-buffer land, and costs
    related to permitting and cell construction are depleted as
    airspace is consumed using the

units-of-consumption

method.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

Capitalized landfill costs may also include an allocation of
    purchase price paid for landfills. For landfills purchased as
    part of a group of assets, the purchase price assigned to the
    landfill is determined based on the estimated fair value of the
    landfill relative to the fair value of other assets within the
    acquired group. If the landfill meets our expansion criteria,
    the purchase price is further allocated between permitted
    airspace and expansion airspace based on the ratio of permitted
    versus probable expansion airspace to total available airspace.
    Landfill purchase price is amortized using the

units-of-consumption

method over the total available airspace including probable
    expansion airspace where appropriate.

Final
    Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

We have future obligations for final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs with respect to the landfills we own or
    operate as set forth in applicable landfill permits. Final
    capping, closure and post-closure costs include estimated costs
    to be incurred for final capping and closure of landfills and
    estimated costs for providing required post-closure monitoring
    and maintenance of landfills. The permit requirements are based
    on the Subtitle C and Subtitle D regulations of the Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as implemented and applied
    on a

state-by-state

basis. Obligations associated with monitoring and controlling
    methane gas migration and emissions are set forth in applicable
    landfill permits and these requirements are based on the
    provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended. Final
    capping typically includes installing flexible membrane and
    geosynthetic clay liners, drainage and compact soil layers, and
    topsoil, and is constructed over an area of the landfill where
    total airspace capacity has been consumed and waste disposal
    operations have ceased. These final capping activities occur as
    needed throughout the operating life of a landfill. Other
    closure activities and post-closure activities occur after the
    entire landfill ceases to accept waste and closes. These
    activities involve methane gas control, leachate management and
    groundwater monitoring, surface water monitoring and control,
    and other operational and maintenance activities that occur
    after the site ceases to accept waste. The post-closure period
    generally runs for up to 30 years after final site closure
    for municipal solid waste landfills and a shorter period for
    construction and demolition landfills and inert landfills.

Estimates of future expenditures for final capping, closure and
    post-closure are developed at least annually by engineers. These
    estimates are reviewed by management and are used by our
    operating and accounting personnel to adjust the rates used to
    capitalize and amortize these costs. These estimates involve
    projections of costs that will be incurred during the remaining
    life of the landfill for final capping activities, after the
    landfill ceases operations and during the legally required
    post-closure monitoring period. We currently retain post-closure
    responsibility for 129 closed landfills.

A liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in
    the period in which it is incurred and is initially measured at
    fair value. Absent quoted market prices, the estimate of fair
    value is based on the best available information, including the
    results of present value techniques. The offset to the liability
    is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related
    long-lived asset. Changes in the liabilities due to the passage
    of time are recognized as operating expenses in the consolidated
    statement of income and are referred to as accretion expense.
    Changes in the liabilities due to revisions to estimated future
    cash flows are recognized by increasing or decreasing the
    liabilities with the offsets adjusting the carrying amounts of
    the related long-lived assets, and may also require immediate
    adjustments to amortization expense in the consolidated
    statement of income.

Landfill asset retirement obligations include estimates of all
    costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure. Costs
    associated with daily maintenance activities during the
    operating life of the landfill, such as leachate disposal,
    groundwater and gas monitoring, and other pollution control
    activities, are charged to expense as incurred. In addition,
    costs historically accounted for as capital expenditures during
    the operating life of a landfill, such as cell development
    costs, are capitalized when incurred, and charged to expense
    using life cycle accounting and the

units-of-consumption

method based on the consumption of cubic yards of available
    airspace.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

We define final capping as activities required to permanently
    cover a portion of a landfill that has been completely filled
    with waste. Final capping occurs in phases as needed throughout
    the operating life of a landfill as specific areas are filled to
    capacity and the final elevation for that specific area is
    reached in accordance with the provisions of the operating
    permit. We consider final capping events to be discrete
    activities that are recognized as asset retirement obligations
    separately from other closure and post-closure obligations.
    These capping events generally occur during the operating life
    of a landfill and can be associated with waste placed in an area
    to be capped. As a result, we use a separate rate per ton for
    recognizing the principal amount of the liability and related
    asset associated with each capping event. We amortize the asset
    recorded pursuant to this approach as waste volume related to
    the capacity covered by the capping event is placed into the
    landfill based on the consumption of cubic yards of available
    airspace.

In connection with the 2008 annual review of our calculations
    with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations, we made a
    change in estimate, which is considered to be a change in
    accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting
    principle. This change, which we believe is preferable, was made
    to better align the estimated amount of waste to be placed in an
    area to be capped (which is used to calculate our capping rates)
    with the physical operation of our landfills. The expected costs
    related to our capping events did not change and we will
    continue to use separate rates for each capping event. This
    change resulted in a $32.6 million decrease in our capping
    asset retirement obligations and related assets. These assets
    will be amortized to expense prospectively. This change in
    estimate did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We recognize asset retirement obligations and the related
    amortization expense for closure and post-closure (excluding
    obligations for final capping) using the

units-of-consumption

method over the total remaining capacity of the landfill. The
    total remaining capacity includes probable expansion airspace.

In general, we engage third parties to perform most of our final
    capping, closure and post-closure activities. Accordingly, the
    fair value of these activities is based on quoted and actual
    prices paid for similar work. We also perform some of our final
    capping, closure and post-closure activities using internal
    resources. Where internal resources are expected to be used to
    fulfill an asset retirement obligation, we add a profit margin
    to the estimated cost of such services to better reflect their
    fair value. If we perform these services internally, the added
    profit margin is recognized as a component of operating income
    in the period the obligation is settled.

An estimate of fair value should include the price that
    marketplace participants are able to receive for bearing the
    uncertainties in cash flows. However, when utilizing discounted
    cash flow techniques, reliable estimates of market premiums may
    not be obtainable. In this situation, it is not necessary to
    consider a market risk premium in the determination of expected
    cash flows. While the cost of asset retirement obligations
    associated with final capping, closure and post-closure can be
    quantified and estimated, there is not an active market that can
    be utilized to determine the fair value of these activities. In
    the waste industry, there generally is not a market for selling
    the responsibility for final capping, closure and post-closure
    independent of selling the landfill in its entirety.
    Accordingly, we believe that it is not possible to develop a
    methodology to reliably estimate a market risk premium and have
    excluded a market risk premium from our determination of
    expected cash flow for landfill asset retirement obligations.

Our estimates of costs to discharge asset retirement obligations
    for landfills are developed in today’s dollars. These costs
    are inflated each year to reflect a normal escalation of prices
    up to the year they are expected to be paid. We use a 2.5%
    inflation rate, which is based on the ten-year historical moving
    average increase of the U.S. Consumer Price Index, and is
    the rate used by most waste industry participants.

These estimated costs are then discounted to their present value
    using a credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate. In general,
    the credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate we used for
    liability recognition was 5.5% and 7.5% for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which was based
    on the estimated all-in yield we would have needed to offer to
    sell thirty-year debt in the public market. However, as part of
    the initial



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

application of purchase accounting, our capping, closure and
    post-closure obligations acquired from Allied were recorded at
    their fair values as of the acquisition date, and were
    discounted using a rate of 9.75% due to market conditions at the
    time of the acquisition.

Changes in asset retirement obligations due to the passage of
    time are measured by recognizing accretion expense in a manner
    that results in a constant effective interest rate being applied
    to the average carrying amount of the liability. The effective
    interest rate used to calculate accretion expense is our
    credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate in effect at the time
    the liabilities were recorded.

Changes due to revisions of the estimates of the amount or
    timing of the original undiscounted cash flows used to record a
    liability are recognized by increasing or decreasing the
    carrying amount of the asset retirement obligation liability and
    the carrying amount of the related asset. Upward revisions in
    the amount of undiscounted estimated cash flows used to record a
    liability are discounted using the credit-adjusted, risk-free
    interest rate in effect at the time of the change. Downward
    revisions in the amount of undiscounted estimated cash flows
    used to record a liability are discounted using the
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate that existed when the original
    liability was recognized.

We review our calculations with respect to landfill asset
    retirement obligations at least annually. If there is a
    significant change in the facts and circumstances related to a
    landfill during the year, we will review our calculations for
    the landfill as soon as practical after the change has occurred.

Environmental
    Operating Costs

In the normal course of business, we expense as incurred various
    operating costs associated with environmental compliance. These
    costs include, among other things, leachate treatment and
    disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and systems
    maintenance, interim cap maintenance, costs associated with the
    application of daily cover materials, and the legal and
    administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance.

Environmental
    Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to
    the protection of the environment, and we remediate sites in the
    ordinary course of our business. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation
    at sites that we either own or operate, including sites that we
    have acquired, or sites where we have (or a company that we have
    acquired has) delivered waste. Our environmental remediation
    liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating
    groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as
    controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related
    legal costs. To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites,
    we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of
    contamination at each identified site, the required remediation
    methods, the apportionment of responsibility among the
    potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of
    those parties. We accrue for costs associated with environmental
    remediation obligations when such costs are probable and
    reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss
    contingencies. We periodically review the status of all
    environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood
    of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary. Changes
    in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized
    currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is
    known. Adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the
    near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts. We have
    not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from
    other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies.

The environmental liabilities assumed from Allied relate to
    impacts at both owned and unowned sites. In the case of owned
    sites, we are actively working with the appropriate regulatory
    entity under the applicable regulations (typically RCRA or
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
    Act of 1980 (CERCLA)) to characterize and remediate potential
    issues. At unowned sites, we are working within the regulatory
    and procedural framework established by CERCLA to characterize
    and remediate potential issues,



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

in conjunction with other potentially liable parties at each
    location. Pursuant to the purchase method of accounting, we have
    recorded the environmental remediation liabilities assumed from
    Allied based upon estimates of their fair value, using an
    estimate of future cash flows or settlement. Previously, and
    consistent with our method of accounting, Allied recorded
    remediation liabilities based upon accounting for loss
    contingencies, however, amounts recorded under this method are
    generally not at fair value.

Since the date of acquisition, our process for deriving fair
    value for the environmental liabilities assumed from Allied
    included first identifying the population of remediation sites
    where we are either fully or partially responsible for
    remediation or potential remediation. The population of
    remediation sites was then stratified into categories based on
    (i) the maturity of the issue relative to recognized stages
    in the applicable regulation (typically CERCLA or RCRA) and
    (ii) the extent of our participation in the remediation
    activity. Using these categories, we applied one of the
    following multiple estimation processes to quantify fair value:

•

For sites with established responsibility but a high level of
    uncertainty with the outcome of the remedial process, we
    developed multiple remediation scenarios. We then probability
    weighted the remediation scenarios to develop a fair value
    estimate.

•

For sites where the level of responsibility was less defined, we
    developed a fair value estimate of the settlement costs based
    upon market participant assessments from external legal counsel.

•

For sites which we own and are in the earliest stages of the
    remedial process, we identified the most applicable standard
    remedial techniques and then probability weighted the use of
    each technique to develop a fair value estimate.

•

For the remaining sites with low levels of uncertainty, we
    developed a primary remedial strategy and cost estimate to
    determine the fair value of the liability.

The initial liabilities recorded as part of the Allied
    acquisition were recorded using provisional amounts based upon
    information available at that time. During 2009, we gathered and
    assessed new information obtained about the facts and
    circumstances surrounding Allied’s remediation sites. In
    certain situations, we used external engineers and attorneys to
    assist in the development of our fair value estimates. As a
    result of that process, we increased the fair value of our
    remediation reserves assumed from Allied by $181.9 million.
    Any further adjustments to our remediation reserves resulting in
    changes in estimate or reserve settlements will be reflected
    currently in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments
    become known.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We annually test goodwill at December 31 for impairment or when
    an indicator of impairment exists. We test goodwill for
    impairment using a two-step process. The first step is a screen
    for potential impairment, while the second step measures the
    amount of the impairment, if any. The first step of the goodwill
    impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with
    its carrying amount, including goodwill.

We have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our
    operating segments: Eastern, Midwestern, Southern, and Western.
    In determining fair value, we primarily utilize discounted
    future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative
    multiple of earnings or revenues.

Significant estimates used in our fair value calculation
    utilizing discounted future cash flows include, but are not
    limited to: (i) estimates of future revenue and expense
    growth by reporting unit, which we estimate to range from 3% to
    5%; (ii) future estimated effective tax rates, which we
    estimate to be 40%; (iii) future estimated capital
    expenditures as well as future required investments in working
    capital; (iv) estimated discount rates, which we estimate
    to range between 8% and 10%; and (v) the future terminal
    value of the reporting unit, which is based on its ability to
    exist into perpetuity. Significant estimates used in the fair
    value calculation utilizing market value multiples include but
    are not limited to: (i) estimated future growth potential
    of the reporting unit; (ii) estimated multiples of revenue
    or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay; and
    (iii) estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely
    to pay.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

We evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or
    circumstances change between annual tests, indicating a possible
    impairment. Examples of such events or circumstances include:
    (i) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the
    business climate; (ii) an adverse action or assessment by a
    regulator; (iii) a more likely than not expectation that a
    reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold;
    (iv) continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit;
    (v) a significant decline in our market capitalization as
    compared to our book value or (vi) the testing for
    recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting
    unit.

We assign assets and liabilities from our corporate reporting
    segment to our four operating segments to the extent that such
    assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting
    unit and would be included in determining the reporting
    unit’s fair value.

In preparing our annual test for impairment as of
    December 31, 2010, we determined that our indicated fair
    value of equity exceeded our market capitalization. We
    determined market capitalization as the fair value of our common
    shares outstanding at the closing market price on
    December 31, 2010. We believe one of the primary
    reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of
    equity and our market capitalization is due to a control
    premium. We believe the control premium represents the value a
    market participant could extract as savings

and/or

synergies by obtaining control, and thereby eliminating
    duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting from the
    consolidation of routes and internalization of waste streams.

As of December 31, 2010, we determined that the indicated
    fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value
    by a range of 120% to in excess of 170% and, as such, we noted
    no indicators of impairment at our reporting units.

We will continuously monitor market trends in our business, the
    related expected cash flows and our calculation of market
    capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators
    of impairment. If our book value per share exceeds our market
    price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment, we
    will be required to perform an interim step one impairment
    analysis, which may lead to a step two analysis and possible
    impairment of our goodwill. Additionally, we would then be
    required to review our remaining long-lived assets for
    impairment.

Our operating segments, which also represent our reporting
    units, are comprised of several vertically integrated
    businesses. When an individual business within an integrated
    operating segment is divested, goodwill is allocated to that
    business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of
    its operating segment.

Other intangible assets include values assigned to customer
    relationships, long-term contracts, covenants not to compete and
    trade names, and are amortized generally on a straight-line
    basis over periods ranging from 2 to 23 years.

Asset
    Impairments

We continually consider whether events or changes in
    circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the
    estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets (other than
    goodwill) or whether the remaining balances of those assets
    should be evaluated for possible impairment. Long-lived assets
    include, for example, capitalized landfill costs, other property
    and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets. Events or
    changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset may be
    impaired include the following:

•

A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset
    group,

•

A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition,

•

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business

•

A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a
    history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or
    forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the
    use of a long-lived asset or asset group,

•

A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived
    asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of
    significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
    life, or

•

An impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit.

There are certain indicators listed above that require
    significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry
    when applied to landfill development or expansion. For example,
    a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit
    application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted.
    In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one
    landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill
    airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary
    course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators
    of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry.

If indicators of impairment exist, the asset or asset group is
    reviewed to determine whether its recoverability is impaired. We
    assess the recoverability of the asset or asset group by
    comparing its carrying value to an estimate (or estimates) of
    its undiscounted future cash flows over its remaining life. If
    the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group, we
    measure an impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The loss is recorded
    in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which
    such impairment is identified. Estimating future cash flows
    requires significant judgment, and our projections of future
    cash flows and remaining useful lives may vary materially from
    actual results.

Self-Insurance
    Reserves

Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general
    liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care
    benefits are effectively self-insured. Accruals for
    self-insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates
    of claims incurred but not reported. We consider our past claims
    experience, including both frequency and settlement amount of
    claims, in determining these estimates. It is possible that
    recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future
    payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to estimates recorded
    resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in the
    consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such
    adjustments are known. In general, our self-insurance reserves
    are recorded on an undiscounted basis. However, the
    self-insurance liabilities we acquired in the Allied acquisition
    have been recorded at estimated fair value, and, therefore, have
    been discounted to present value based on our estimate of the
    timing of the related cash flows.

As we are the primary obligor for payment of all claims, we
    report our insurance claim liabilities on a gross basis in other
    current and long-term liabilities and any associated recoveries
    from our insurers are recorded in other assets.

Business
    Combinations

We acquire businesses in the waste industry, including
    non-hazardous waste collection, transfer, materials recovery
    facilities and disposal operations, as part of our growth
    strategy. Businesses are included in the consolidated financial
    statements from the date of acquisition. For all acquisitions
    completed prior to December 31, 2008 (prior to the
    effective date of the new business combinations pronouncement),
    the cost of the acquired businesses was allocated to the assets
    acquired and the liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair
    values thereof. These estimates were revised during the
    allocation period as necessary if, and when, information
    regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and
    quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation
    period generally does not exceed one year. To the extent
    contingencies such as pre-acquisition environmental matters,
    litigation and related legal fees were resolved or settled
    during the allocation period or prior to December 31, 2008,
    such items were included in the revised allocation of the



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

purchase price. After December 31, 2008 or the expiration
    of the allocation period, whichever was later, the effect of
    changes in such contingencies is included in results of
    operations in the periods in which the adjustments are
    determined.

For all acquisitions completed after December 31, 2008, we
    recognize, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated
    acquisition-date fair values. We measure and recognize goodwill
    as of the acquisition date as the excess of: (i) the
    aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred, the
    fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (if
    any) and the acquisition-date fair value of our previously held
    equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over (ii) the
    fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If
    information about facts and circumstances existing as of the
    acquisition date is incomplete by the end of the reporting
    period in which a business combination occurs, we will report
    provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is
    incomplete. The measurement or allocation period ends once we
    receive the information we were seeking; however, this period
    will not exceed one year from the acquisition date. Any material
    adjustments recognized during the measurement period will be
    reflected retrospectively in the consolidated financial
    statements of the subsequent period. We will recognize
    third-party transaction related costs as expense currently in
    the period in which they are incurred.

Discontinued
    Operations

We analyze our operations that have been divested or classified
    as

held-for-sale

in order to determine if they qualify for discontinued
    operations accounting. Only operations that qualify as a
    component of an entity under U.S. GAAP can be included in
    discontinued operations. In addition, only components where we
    do not have significant continuing involvement with the divested
    operations would qualify for discontinued operations accounting.
    For our purposes, continuing involvement would include
    continuing to receive waste at our landfill or recycling
    facility from a divested hauling operation or transfer station
    or continuing to dispose of waste at a divested landfill or
    transfer station.

Costs
    Associated with Exit Activities

We record costs associated with exit activities such as employee
    termination benefits that represent a one-time benefit when
    management approves and commits to a plan of termination, and
    communicates the termination arrangement to the employees, or
    over the future service period, if any. Other costs associated
    with exit activities may include contract termination costs,
    including costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or
    subleased, and facility and employee relocation costs.

In addition, we account for costs to exit an activity of an
    acquired company and involuntary employee termination benefits
    associated with acquired businesses in the purchase price
    allocation of the acquired business if a plan to exit an
    activity of an acquired company exists, and those costs have no
    future economic benefit to us and will be incurred as a direct
    result of the exit plan, or the exit costs represent amounts to
    be incurred by us under a contractual obligation of the acquired
    entity that existed prior to the acquisition date. We recognize
    employee termination benefits as liabilities assumed as of the
    acquisition date when management approves and commits to a plan
    of termination, and communicates the termination arrangement to
    the employees, if the future service period for these employees
    is less than sixty days from their date of notification.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and
    regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to
    significant uncertainty. In general, we determine whether to
    disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment
    of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or
    probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated. We assess
    our potential liability relating to litigation and regulatory
    matters based on information available to us. Management’s
    assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible
    outcomes under various strategies. We accrue for loss
    contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

estimable. If a contingent liability is only reasonably
    possible, we disclose the potential range of the loss, if
    estimable.

Contingent liabilities recorded in purchase accounting are
    recorded at their fair values. These fair values may be
    different from the values we would have otherwise recorded, had
    the contingent liability not been assumed as part of an
    acquisition of a business.

Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income

Accumulated other comprehensive income is a component of
    stockholders’ equity and includes the effective portion of
    the net changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges which
    consist of prices for diesel fuel and other commodities, net of
    tax, and certain adjustments to liabilities associated with our
    employee benefit plan liabilities, net of tax.

Revenue
    Recognition

We generally provide services under contracts with
    municipalities or individual customers. Municipal and commercial
    contracts are generally long-term and often have renewal
    options. Advance billings are recorded as deferred revenue, and
    revenue is recognized over the period services are provided. No
    single customer has individually accounted for more than 3% of
    our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in
    any of the past three years.

We recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are
    met:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists such as a service
    agreement with a municipality, a hauling customer or a disposal
    customer,

•

Services have been performed such as the collection and hauling
    of waste or the disposal of waste at a disposal facility owned
    or operated by us,

•

The price of the services provided to the customer is fixed or
    determinable, and

•

Collectibility is reasonably assured.

Income
    Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and Puerto
    Rico. We record deferred income taxes to reflect the effects of
    temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities and their tax bases using enacted tax rates that we
    expect to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or
    recovered.

We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these
    assets will more likely than not be realized. In making these
    determinations, we consider all available positive and negative
    evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax
    liabilities, tax planning strategies, projected future taxable
    income and recent financial operating results. If we determine
    that we would be able to realize a deferred income tax asset in
    the future in excess of its net recorded amount, we would make
    an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the
    provision for income taxes.

A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized
    when it is more likely than not that the position will be
    sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related
    appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.
    Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not
    recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.

We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
    positions in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and
    penalties are included in other accrued liabilities, and
    deferred income taxes and other long-term tax liabilities, in
    the consolidated balance sheets.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plan

We currently have one qualified defined pension plan, the BFI
    Retirement Plan (the Plan). The Plan covers certain current and
    former employees of Allied in the United States, including some
    employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. The
    Plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of
    compensation as defined in the Plan document. However, the
    benefits of approximately 97% of the current plan participants
    were frozen upon Allied’s acquisition of BFI in 1999.

Our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding
    standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security
    Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as
    amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Plan’s
    assets have been invested as determined by our Retirement
    Benefits Committee. We annually review and adjust the
    Plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary.

The benefit obligation and associated income or expense related
    to the Plan are determined using annually established
    assumptions for discount rates, expected rates of return and
    average rates for compensation increases. We determine the
    discount rate based on a model that matches the timing and
    amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high
    quality bonds priced as of the pension plan measurement date.
    When that timing does not correspond to a published high-quality
    bond rate, our model uses an expected yield curve to determine
    an appropriate current discount rate. The yields on the bonds
    are used to derive a discount rate for the liability. In
    developing our expected rate of return assumption, we evaluate
    long-term expected and historical actual returns on the plan
    assets, giving consideration to our asset mix and the
    anticipated duration of our plan obligations. The average rate
    of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average
    pay increases over the periods benefits are earned. Our
    assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed
    necessary.

Equity-Based
    Compensation Plans

We recognize equity-based compensation expense on the estimated
    fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments
    issued as compensation to employees over the requisite service
    periods.

Cash flows resulting from tax benefits related to tax deductions
    in excess of those recorded for compensation expense, resulting
    from the exercise of stock options, are classified as cash flows
    from financing activities. All other tax benefits related to
    stock options have been presented as a component of cash flows
    from operating activities.

We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over
    the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion
    of the award, or to the employee’s retirement-eligible
    date, if earlier.

The fair value of each option on the date of grant is estimated
    using a lattice binomial option-pricing model based on certain
    valuation assumptions. Expected volatilities are based on our
    historical stock prices over the contractual terms of the
    options and other factors. The risk-free interest rates are
    based on the published U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
    at the time of the grant for instruments with a similar life.
    The dividend yield reflects our dividend yield at the date of
    grant. The expected life represents the period that the stock
    options are expected to be outstanding, taking into
    consideration the contractual terms of the options and our
    employees’ historical exercise and post-vesting employment
    termination behavior, weighted to reflect the job level
    demographic profile of the employees receiving the option
    grants. The estimated forfeiture rate used to record
    compensation expense is based on historical forfeitures and is
    adjusted periodically based on actual results.

Leases

We lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of our
    business. Our most significant lease obligations are for
    property and equipment specific to our industry, including real
    property operated as a landfill or transfer station and
    operating equipment. Our leases have varying terms. Some may
    include renewal or



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

purchase options, escalation clauses, restrictions, penalties or
    other obligations that we consider in determining minimum lease
    payments. The leases are classified as either operating leases
    or capital leases, as appropriate.

Operating
    Leases

Many of our leases are operating leases. This classification
    generally can be attributed to either (i) relatively low
    fixed minimum lease payments (including, for example, real
    property lease payments that are not fixed and vary based on the
    volume of waste we receive or process), or (ii) minimum
    lease terms that are much shorter than the assets’ economic
    useful lives. Management expects that, in the normal course of
    business, our operating leases will be renewed, replaced by
    other leases, or replaced with fixed asset expenditures.

Capital
    Leases

Assets acquired under capital leases are capitalized at the
    inception of each lease and are amortized to depreciation
    expense over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the
    lease term on either a straight-line or a

units-of-consumption

basis, depending on the asset leased. The present value of the
    related lease payments is recorded as a debt obligation.

Related
    Party Transactions

It is our policy that transactions with related parties must be
    on terms that, on the whole, are no less favorable than those
    that would be available from unaffiliated parties.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Fair
    Value Measurements

In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the
    disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring
    fair value measurements. The guidance requires new disclosures
    on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1
    and Level 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy,
    including the reasons and timing of the transfers, which we
    adopted effective January 1, 2010. Additionally, the
    guidance requires a rollforward of activities related to the
    purchases, sales, issuance and settlements of assets and
    liabilities measured using Level 3 fair value measurements.
    This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance will
    increase the level of disclosures in the financial statements
    related to fair value measurements.

Consolidation
    of Variable Interest Entities

In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and
    disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable
    interest entities (VIEs) and requires an enterprise to perform
    an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable
    interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest
    in a VIE. Under this new guidance, an enterprise has a
    controlling financial interest when it has (i) the power to
    direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact
    the entity’s economic performance and (ii) the
    obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to
    receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
    significant to the VIE. An enterprise is required to assess
    whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure
    that a VIE operates as designed when determining whether it has
    power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. It
    also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is
    the primary beneficiary of a VIE, requires enhanced disclosures
    and eliminates the scope exclusion for qualifying
    special-purpose entities. We adopted this new guidance on
    January 1, 2010 and the adoption did not have a material
    effect on our consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the
    accounting and reporting requirements for decreases in ownership
    of a subsidiary. This guidance requires that a decrease in the
    ownership interest of a subsidiary that does not result in a
    change of control be treated as an equity transaction. The
    guidance also expands the disclosure requirements about the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. We adopted this guidance
    effective January 1, 2010 and it did not have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

Goodwill
    Impairment Test

In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which
    modifies the requirements of Step 1 of the goodwill impairment
    test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
    This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2010, and we anticipate that it will not have
    a material impact on our consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

BUSINESS
    ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES AND RESTRUCTURING
    CHARGES

Acquisition
    of Allied Waste Industries, Inc.

Rationale
    for the Acquisition

We believe that the Allied acquisition results in a combined
    company that has greater financial strength, operational
    efficiencies, earning power and growth potential than either we
    or Allied would have on our own. We believe that there is a
    substantial strategic fit between the markets serviced by
    Republic, which are located predominantly in high-growth Sunbelt
    markets, and those served by Allied, which has a national
    footprint. Since our collection markets are highly
    complementary, the combined company is diversified across
    geographic markets, customer segments and service offerings.
    This balance will allow our combined company to capitalize on
    attractive business opportunities, mitigate geographic risk, and
    results in greater stability and predictability of revenue and
    free cash flow. We also believe that the acquisition will result
    in a number of important synergies, primarily from achieving
    greater operating efficiencies, capturing inherent economies of
    scale and leveraging corporate resources. Therefore, we believe
    that the premium we paid to effectuate the acquisition was
    reasonable.

Purchase
    Price

The purchase price paid for Allied, which was acquired on
    December 5, 2008, includes the value of Republic’s
    common stock issued in exchange for Allied’s outstanding
    common stock, the conversion of Allied’s outstanding stock
    options and unvested restricted stock awards into
    Republic’s equity-based awards, cash paid to retire
    Allied’s revolving credit facility, the fair value of
    Allied’s debt less cash assumed at closing and
    Republic’s transaction costs.

    these intangible assets are reflected in the previous table.
    Other intangible assets were identified that are considered to
    be components of either property and equipment or goodwill under
    U.S. GAAP, including the value of the permitted and
    probable airspace at Allied’s landfills (property and
    equipment), the going concern element of Allied’s business
    (goodwill) and its assembled workforce (goodwill). The going
    concern element represents the ability of an established
    business to earn a higher rate of return on an assembled
    collection of net assets than would be expected if those assets
    had to be acquired separately. A substantial portion of this
    going concern element

acquired is represented by Allied’s infrastructure of

Restructuring
    Charges

As a result of the 2008 Allied acquisition, we committed to a
    restructuring plan related to our corporate overhead and other
    administrative and operating functions. The plan included
    closing our corporate office in Florida, consolidating
    administrative functions to Arizona, the former headquarters of
    Allied, and reducing staffing levels. The plan also included
    closing and consolidating certain operating locations and
    terminating certain leases. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, we incurred $11.4 million,
    net of adjustments, and $63.2 million, respectively, of
    restructuring and integration charges related to our integration
    of Allied. These charges and adjustments primarily related to
    severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits
    and consulting and professional fees. Substantially all the
    charges are recorded in our corporate segment. We do not expect
    to incur additional charges to complete our plan. We expect that
    the remaining charges will be paid during 2011.

The initial legal contingencies recorded as part of the Allied
    acquisition were estimated using provisional amounts based upon
    information available at that time. During 2009, we gathered and
    assessed new information obtained about the facts and
    circumstances surrounding various Allied legal matters, and as a
    result increased the legal reserves by $53.9 million. Any
    further adjustments to our Allied legal matter reserves
    resulting from changes in estimates or reserve settlements will
    be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the
    periods in which such adjustments become known.

During 2009, we recorded additional liabilities for unfavorable
    contract and lease exit costs of $22.6 million and
    $7.7 million, respectively.

Divestitures

In 2010, we divested of solid waste businesses in our Eastern
    and Midwestern regions and recognized a net loss of
    $4.0 million.

In October 2009, we divested a hauling operation in our Southern
    region and recognized a loss of $10.2 million.

As a condition of the Allied acquisition, the Department of
    Justice (DOJ) required us to divest of certain assets and
    related liabilities. During 2009, we completed our required
    divestitures and recognized a net gain of $153.5 million.

Self-Insurance
    Reserves

In general, our self-insurance reserves are recorded on an
    undiscounted basis. However, our estimate of the self-insurance
    liabilities assumed in the Allied acquisition have been recorded
    at fair value, and, therefore, have been discounted to present
    value using a rate of 9.75%. Discounted reserves are accreted to
    interest expense through the period that they are paid.

Our liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims
    at December 31, 2010 (which includes claims for
    workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability
    and employee health care benefits) were $417.2 million
    under our current risk management program and are included in
    other accrued liabilities and self-insurance reserves, net of
    current portion in our consolidated balance sheets. While the
    ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future
    developments, we believe recorded reserves are adequate to cover
    the future payment of claims. However, it is possible that
    recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future
    payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to estimates recorded
    resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in our
    consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such
    adjustments are

The initial liabilities recorded as part of the Allied

    information available at that time. During 2009, we gathered and
    assessed new information about



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

the facts and circumstances surrounding our sites, and, as a
    result, increased the fair value of our closure and post-closure
    reserves by $72.3 million. The amounts we have recorded for
    these obligations are not comparable to the amounts Allied
    recorded. As part of the initial application of purchase
    accounting, we have recorded these obligations at their
    estimated fair values, inflated them to the expected payment
    date and then discounted the obligations using our
    credit-adjusted, risk-free rate at the time of the acquisition
    of 9.75%. Any further adjustments to our final capping, closure
    and post-closure liabilities will be reflected prospectively in
    our consolidated statement of income in the periods in which
    such adjustments become known.

We review our landfill asset retirement obligations annually. As
    a result, we recorded a net decrease in amortization expense of
    $10.2 million and $5.1 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and a net
    increase in amortization expense of $0.6 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, primarily related to changes
    in estimates and assumptions concerning the cost and timing of
    future final capping, closure and post-closure activities.

The fair value of assets that are legally restricted for
    purposes of settling final capping, closure and post-closure
    obligations was approximately $59.1 million at
    December 31, 2010 and is included in restricted cash in our
    consolidated balance sheet.

The expected future payments for final capping, closure and
    post-closure as of December 31, 2010 are as follows:

The estimated remaining final capping, closure and post-closure
    expenditures presented above are not inflated and not discounted
    and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities
    incurred and recorded as of December 31, 2010.

Environmental
    Remediation Liabilities

We accrue for remediation costs when they become probable and
    can be reasonably estimated. We believe that the amounts accrued
    for remediation costs are adequate. There can sometimes be a
    range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with
    remediation of a site. In these cases, we use the amount within
    the range that constitutes our best estimate. If no amount
    within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other,
    we use the amount that is at the low end of such range. It is
    reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the liabilities
    recorded for remediation to reflect the effects of new or
    additional information, to the extent such information impacts
    the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. If we
    used the reasonably possible high ends of our ranges, our
    aggregate potential remediation liability at December 31,
    2010 would be approximately $155 million higher than the
    amounts recorded. Future changes in our estimates of the cost,
    timing or duration of the required actions could have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

The following is a discussion of certain of our significant
    remediation matters:

Countywide Landfill.

In September 2009, Republic
    Services of Ohio II, LLC entered into Final Findings and Orders
    with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency that require us to
    implement a comprehensive operation and maintenance program to
    manage the remediation area at the Countywide Recycling and
    Disposal Facility (Countywide). The remediation liability for
    Countywide recorded as of December 31, 2010 is
    $68.4 million, of which $7.1 million is expected to be
    paid during 2011. We believe the reasonably possible range of
    loss for remediation costs is $59 million to
    $81 million.

West Contra Costa County Landfill.

In 2006, we were
    issued an Enforcement Order by the California Department of
    Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) for the Class 1 Hazardous
    waste cell at the West Contra Costa County Landfill (West
    County). Subsequently, we entered into a Consent Agreement with
    DTSC in 2007 at which time we agreed to undertake certain
    remedial actions. The remediation liability for West County
    recorded as of December 31, 2010 is $46.5 million, of
    which $2.5 million is expected to be paid during 2011. We
    believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation
    costs is $36 million to $63 million.

Sunrise Landfill.

In August 2008, Republic Services
    of Southern Nevada (RSSN), signed a Consent Decree with the EPA,
    the Bureau of Land Management and Clark County, Nevada related
    to the Sunrise Landfill. Under the Consent Decree, RSSN has
    agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the Sunrise
    Landfill for which RSSN and Clark County were otherwise jointly
    and severally liable. We also paid $1.0 million in
    sanctions related to the Consent Decree. RSSN is currently
    working with the Clark County Staff and Board of Commissioners
    to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the
    Consent Decree. However, we have not recorded any potential
    recoveries. The remediation liability for Sunrise recorded as of
    December 31, 2010 is $37.5 million, of which
    $23.0 million is expected to be paid during 2011. We
    believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation
    costs is $29 million to $44 million.

In August 2010, Congress
    Development Company agreed with the State of Illinois to have a
    Final Consent Order (Final Order) entered by the Circuit Court
    of Illinois, Cook County. Pursuant to the

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

Final Order, we have agreed to continue to implement certain
    remedial activities at the Congress Landfill. The remediation
    liability recorded as of December 31, 2010 is
    $82.6 million, of which $8.4 million is expected to be
    paid during 2011. We believe the reasonably possible range of
    loss for remediation costs is $46 million to
    $146 million.

It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the
    liabilities noted above to reflect the effects of new or
    additional information, to the extent that such information
    impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions.
    Future changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration
    of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Credit
    Facilities

The $1.0 billion revolving credit facility due April 2012
    and the $1.75 billion revolving credit facility due
    September 2013 (collectively, Credit Facilities) bear interest
    at a Base Rate, or a Eurodollar Rate, plus an applicable margin
    based on our Debt Ratings (all as defined in the agreements). As
    of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the interest rate for our
    borrowings under our Credit Facilities was 1.56% and 1.62%,
    respectively. Our Credit Facilities are also subject to facility
    fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the
    aggregate commitments, regardless of usage. Availability under
    our Credit Facilities can be used for working capital, capital
    expenditures, letters of credit and other general corporate
    purposes. The agreements governing our Credit Facilities require
    us to maintain certain financial and other covenants. We may pay
    dividends and repurchase common stock provided that we are in
    compliance with these covenants. We had $75.0 million and
    $300.0 million of Eurodollar Rate borrowings and nil and
    $15.4 million of Base Rate borrowings as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We had
    $1,037.5 million and $1,634.0 million of letters of
    credit utilizing availability under our Credit Facilities,
    leaving $1,637.5 million and $800.6 million of
    availability under our Credit Facilities at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. We were in compliance with the
    covenants under our Credit Facilities at December 31, 2010.

Receivables
    Secured Loans

In March 2010, we repaid all borrowings and terminated our
    accounts receivable securitization program with two financial
    institutions that allowed us to borrow up to $300.0 million
    on a revolving basis under loan agreements secured by
    receivables. During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded a
    loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million to write-off
    unamortized deferred issuance costs associated with this program.

Senior
    Notes and Debentures

In November 2010, our 6.50% senior notes matured. We used
    cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our Credit
    Facilities to repay $221.6 million of principal due on
    these notes.

In March 2010, we issued $850.0 million of
    5.00% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes), with an
    unamortized discount of $0.1 million at December 31,
    2010, and $650.0 million of 6.20% senior notes due
    2040 (the 2040 Notes, and, together with the 2020 Notes, the
    Notes), with an unamortized discount of $0.5 million at
    December 31, 2010. The Notes are general senior unsecured
    obligations and mature on March 1, 2020 (in the case of the
    2020 Notes) and March 1, 2040 (in the case of the 2040
    Notes). Interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and
    September 1. The Notes are guaranteed by each of our
    subsidiaries that also guarantees our Credit Facilities. These
    guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of our
    subsidiary guarantors.

We used the net proceeds from the Notes as follows:
    (i) $433.7 million to redeem the 6.125% senior
    notes due 2014 at a premium of 102.042% ($425.0 million
    principal outstanding); (ii) $621.8 million to redeem
    the 7.250% senior notes due 2015 at a premium of 103.625%
    ($600.0 million principal outstanding); and (iii) the
    remainder to reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit
    Facilities and for general corporate purposes. During the first
    quarter of 2010, we incurred a loss of $132.1 million for
    premiums paid to repurchase debt, to write-off unamortized debt
    discounts and for professional fees paid to effectuate the
    repurchase of the senior notes.

In December 2009 we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings
    under our Credit Facilities to redeem $400.0 million of our
    7.375% senior notes due 2014. The senior notes were
    redeemed at a price equal to 103.688% of the principal amount of
    the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We incurred a loss
    of $46.0 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt, to
    write-off unamortized debt discounts and for professional fees
    paid to effectuate the repurchase of the senior notes.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

In November 2009, we issued $600.0 million of
    5.250% senior notes due 2021. The notes are general senior
    unsecured obligations and mature on November 15, 2021.
    Interest is payable semi-annually on May 15 and
    November 15, beginning May 15, 2010. These senior
    notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also
    guarantees our Credit Facilities. These guarantees are general
    senior unsecured obligations of the subsidiary guarantors. We
    used the net proceeds from the notes, cash on hand or
    incremental borrowings under our Credit Facilities as follows:
    (i) to redeem $450.0 million of our 7.875% Senior
    Notes due 2013 at 102.625%, and (ii) to redeem
    $230.0 million of our 4.250% Senior Convertible
    Debentures due 2034 at par. We incurred a loss of
    $51.9 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt, to
    write-off unamortized debt discounts and for professional fees
    paid to effectuate the repurchase of the senior notes.

In September 2009, we issued $650.0 million of
    5.500% senior notes due 2019 with an unamortized discount
    of $4.2 million and $4.5 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. The notes are general senior
    unsecured obligations and mature on September 15, 2019.
    Interest is payable semi-annually on March 15 and
    September 15, beginning March 15, 2010. The notes are
    guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also guarantee our
    Credit Facilities. These guarantees are general senior unsecured
    obligations of subsidiary guarantors. We used the net proceeds
    from the notes, cash on hand or incremental borrowings under our
    Credit Facilities as follows: (i) to tender for
    $325.5 million of certain outstanding senior notes maturing
    in 2010 and 2011 that were issued by us or one of our
    subsidiaries; (ii) approximately $250 million to
    reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility, and
    (iii) approximately $105 million to remit estimated
    tax payments related to our divestiture of assets in connection
    with the Allied acquisition. We incurred a loss of
    $31.8 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt, to
    write-off unamortized debt discounts and for professional fees
    paid to effectuate the repurchase of the senior notes.

During 2009 we repurchased a portion of our senior notes
    maturing in 2010 and 2011 in the secondary market. As a result,
    we incurred additional losses on extinguishment of debt of
    $4.4 million related to premiums paid to repurchase debt,
    charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees
    paid to effectuate the repurchase. Also during 2009, we
    completed the required divestitures under the consent decree
    with the DOJ. Proceeds from the sales of the divested assets
    were primarily used to reduce amounts outstanding under our
    Credit Facilities. Additionally, our senior unsecured notes
    bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.125% matured during 2009.
    We repaid the remaining principal balance of $99.3 million
    in May 2009.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the following are our
    other senior notes and debentures:

•

    The redemption price is equal to the greater of the principal
    amount of the debentures and the present value of the future
    principal and interest payments discounted at a rate specified

Tax-Exempt
    Financings

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had
    $1,151.8 million and $1,223.7 million, respectively,
    of fixed and variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding
    with maturities ranging from 2012 to 2035. At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, the total of the unamortized adjustment to fair
    value recorded in purchase accounting for the assumed tax-exempt
    financings from the Allied acquisition was $21.9 million
    and $49.0 million, respectively, which is being amortized
    to interest expense over the remaining terms of the debt.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we refinanced
    $677.4 million and repaid $97.8 million of our
    tax-exempt financings resulting in a loss on extinguishment of
    debt of $28.5 million to write-off unamortized debt
    discounts and for professional fees paid to effectuate these
    transactions.

Approximately two-thirds of our tax-exempt financings are
    remarketed quarterly, weekly or daily by a remarketing agent to
    effectively maintain a variable yield. Certain of these variable
    rate tax-exempt financings are credit enhanced with letters of
    credit having terms in excess of one year issued by banks with
    credit ratings of AA or better. The holders of the bonds can put
    them back to the remarketing agent at the end of each interest
    period. To date, the remarketing agents have been able to
    remarket our variable rate unsecured tax-exempt bonds. These
    bonds have been classified as long term because of our ability
    and intent to refinance these bonds using availability under our
    revolving Credit Facilities, if necessary.

    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The carrying
    value of these fixed rate unsecured notes is $5.4 billion
    and $5.0 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The carrying amounts of our remaining notes
    payable and tax-exempt financing approximate fair value because
    interest rates are variable and, accordingly, approximate
    current market rates for instruments with similar risk and
    maturities. The fair value of our debt is determined as of the
    balance sheet date and is subject to change.

Guarantees

Substantially all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our
    obligations under the Credit Facilities.

Substantially all of our subsidiaries guarantee each series of
    senior notes issued by our parent company, Republic Services,
    Inc. Our parent company and substantially all of our
    subsidiaries guarantee each series of senior notes issued by our
    subsidiary Allied Waste North America, Inc. (AWNA notes) and
    each series of senior notes issued by our subsidiary
    Browning-Ferris Industries, LLC (successor to Browning-Ferris
    Industries, Inc.) (BFI notes). All of these guarantees would be
    automatically released upon the release of our subsidiaries from
    their guarantee obligations under the Credit Facilities, except
    the guarantee of Allied in the case of the AWNA notes, and the
    guarantees of Allied and Allied Waste North America, Inc. in the
    case of the BFI notes.

We have guaranteed some of the tax-exempt bonds of our
    subsidiaries. If a subsidiary fails to meet its obligations
    associated with tax-exempt bonds as they come due, we will be
    required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No
    additional liability has been recorded for these guarantees
    because the underlying obligations are reflected in our
    consolidated balance sheets.

Interest
    Rate Swap Agreements

Our ability to obtain financing through the capital markets is a
    key component of our financial strategy. Historically, we have
    managed risk associated with executing this strategy,
    particularly as it relates to fluctuations in interest rates, by
    using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. We also
    entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage risk
    associated with fluctuations in interest rates. The swap
    agreements have a total notional value of $210.0 million
    and mature in August 2011. This maturity is identical to our
    unsecured notes that also mature in 2011. Under the swap
    agreements, we pay interest at floating rates based on changes
    in LIBOR and receive interest at fixed rates of 6.75%. We have
    designated these agreements as hedges of changes in the fair
    value of our fixed-rate debt. We have determined that these
    agreements qualify for the short-cut method and, therefore,
    changes in the fair value of the agreements are assumed to be
    perfectly effective in hedging changes in the fair value of our
    fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, interest rate swap
    agreements are reflected at their fair value of
    $5.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively, and are
    included in other assets and as an adjustment to long-term debt
    in our consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded net interest
    income of $8.5 million, $8.7 million and
    $3.8 million, respectively, related to our interest rate
    swap agreements, which is included in interest expense in our
    consolidated statements of income.

The following table summarizes the impact of changes in the fair
    value of our derivatives and the underlying hedged items on our
    results of operations for the years ended December 31,

From time to time, we enter into treasury and interest rate
    locks for the purpose of managing exposure to fluctuations in
    interest rates in anticipation of future debt issuances. During
    the first quarter of 2010, we entered into interest rate lock
    agreements having an aggregate notional amount of
    $500.0 million to hedge interest rates in connection with
    the issuance of our $850.0 million 5.00% senior notes
    and our $650.0 million 6.20% senior notes. Upon
    issuance of the notes, we terminated the interest rate locks and
    paid $7.0 million to the counterparties. The effective
    portion of the interest rate locks, recorded as a component of

is scheduled to be amortized over the next twelve months as a
    yield adjustment to the 2020 and 2040 Notes. This transaction
    was accounted for as a cash flow hedge.

In September 2009, we entered into treasury lock agreements
    having an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million to
    hedge interest rates on 10 year U.S. Treasury Notes in
    connection with the issuance of our $650.0 million
    5.500% Senior Notes. Upon issuance of the notes we
    terminated the treasury locks and paid approximately
    $2.5 million to the counterparties. This amount, net of
    tax, was recorded as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income and is being amortized as an increase to
    interest expense over the life of the issued debt. This
    transaction was recorded as a cash flow hedge.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no treasury
    lock cash flow hedges outstanding.

Our effective income tax rate is adversely impacted by expenses

    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we incurred charges
    of $13.1 million and $13.5 million, respectively, for
    dispositions of goodwill that had no corresponding tax basis.
    During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred
    expenses that were not tax deductible as a result of the Allied
    acquisition, including a tax charge of $12.3 million
    related to non-deductible compensation payouts. In addition, for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, lower pre-tax earnings
    contributed to the increase in our effective tax rate.

We have state net operating loss carryforwards with an estimated
    tax effect of $127.5 million available at December 31,
    2010. These state net operating loss carryforwards expire at
    various times between 2011 and 2023. We believe that it is more
    likely than not that the benefit from certain state net
    operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. In
    recognition of this risk, at December 31, 2010, we have
    provided a valuation allowance of $110.1 million for
    certain state net operating loss carryforwards. In assessing the
    realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
    whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized after the initial
    recognition of the deferred tax asset. We also provide valuation
    allowances, as needed, to offset portions of deferred tax assets
    due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such
    deferred tax assets. We adjust the valuation allowance in the
    period management determines it is more likely than not that
    deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. At
    December 31, 2010, we have provided a valuation allowance
    of $10.0 million for certain deferred tax assets.

We made income tax payments (net of refunds received) of
    approximately $418 million, $444 million, and
    $128 million for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2008,

New accounting guidance for business combinations became
    effective for our 2009 financial statements. This new guidance
    changed the treatment of acquired uncertain tax liabilities.
    Under previous guidance, changes in acquired uncertain tax
    liabilities were recognized through goodwill. Under the new
    guidance, subsequent changes in acquired unrecognized tax
    liabilities are recognized through the income tax provision. As
    of December 31, 2010, $206.5 million of the
    $222.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax
    positions taken by Allied prior to the 2008 acquisition.

Included in the balance at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are
    approximately $209.1 million and $217.6 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits (net of the federal benefit on state
    issues) that, if recognized, would affect the effective income
    tax rate in future periods.

During 2010, the IRS concluded its examination of our 2005 and
    2007 tax years. The conclusion of this examination reduced our
    gross unrecognized tax benefits by approximately
    $1.9 million. We also resolved various state matters during
    2010 that, in the aggregate, reduced our gross unrecognized tax
    benefits by approximately $10.0 million.

During 2009, we settled our outstanding tax dispute related to
    Allied’s risk management companies (see –

Risk
    Management Companies

) with both the Department of Justice
    (DOJ) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This settlement
    reduced our gross unrecognized tax benefits by approximately
    $299.6 million. During 2009, we also settled with the IRS,
    through an accounting method change, our outstanding tax dispute
    related to intercompany insurance premiums paid to Allied’s
    captive insurance company. This settlement reduced our gross
    unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $62.6 million.
    In addition to these federal matters, we also resolved various
    state matters that, in the aggregate, reduced our gross
    unrecognized tax benefits during 2009 by approximately
    $5.8 million.

We recognize interest and penalties as incurred within the
    provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of
    income. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits previously
    noted, we accrued interest of $19.2 million during 2010
    and, in total as of December 31, 2010, have recognized a
    liability for penalties of $1.2 million and interest of
    $99.9 million. During 2009, we accrued interest of
    $24.5 million and, in total at December 31, 2009, had
    recognized a liability for penalties of $1.5 million and
    interest of $92.3 million. During 2008, we accrued
    penalties of $0.2 million and interest of $5.2 million
    and, in total at December 31, 2008, had recognized a
    liability for penalties of $88.1 million and interest of
    $180.0 million.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

The increase in accrued interest during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 was due to the additional accrual of
    interest on existing uncertain tax positions. The decrease in
    accrued interest and penalties between 2009 and 2008 was driven
    mainly by the settlements discussed previously.

Gross unrecognized tax benefits that we expect to settle in the
    following twelve months cannot be reasonably estimated. It is
    likely, however, that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits
    will increase or decrease in the next twelve months.

We and our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the
    U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as income tax in multiple
    state jurisdictions. We also have acquired Allied’s open
    tax periods as a result of the December 2008 acquisition. Allied
    is currently under examination or administrative review by
    various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax
    years, including federal income tax audits for calendar years
    2000 through 2007.

Prior to the 2008 acquisition, the IRS had commenced an
    examination of our 2005 through 2007 tax years. During 2010,
    this examination was completed. Currently, the IRS is examining
    our 2008 tax year. We are also under state examination in
    various jurisdictions for various tax years. These state audits
    are ongoing.

We are subject to numerous federal, foreign, state and local tax
    rules and regulations. Our compliance with such rules and
    regulations is periodically audited by tax authorities. These
    authorities may challenge the positions taken in our tax
    filings. As such, to provide for certain potential tax
    exposures, we maintain liabilities for uncertain tax positions
    for our estimate of the final outcome of the examinations.

We believe that the liabilities for uncertain tax positions
    recorded are adequate. However, a significant assessment against
    us in excess of the liabilities recorded could have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

Risk
    Management Companies

Prior to Allied’s acquisition of Browning-Ferris Industries
    (BFI) in July 1999, certain BFI operating companies, as part of
    a risk management initiative to manage and reduce costs
    associated with certain liabilities, contributed assets and
    existing environmental and self-insurance liabilities to six
    fully consolidated BFI risk management companies (RMCs) in
    exchange for stock representing a minority ownership interest in
    the RMCs. Subsequently, the BFI operating companies sold that
    stock in the RMCs to third parties at fair market value which
    resulted in a capital loss for tax purposes.

In 2001, the IRS designated this type of transaction and other
    similar transactions as a “potentially abusive tax
    shelter” under IRS regulations. During 2002, the IRS
    disallowed all of the previously claimed capital loss.
    Subsequent to the IRS disallowance, we challenged the issue at
    both IRS appeals and in federal court. In December 2009, we
    reached a settlement with both the DOJ and the IRS for all tax
    years impacted by the issue. Under the settlement, the company
    resolved all remaining liability (including federal and state
    tax, penalty and interest) for approximately $125 million.
    During 2010, we paid approximately $111 million related to
    this settlement and expect to pay the remaining amounts in 2011
    and 2012. While the final settlement amount was less than the
    amount previously accrued for this matter, the accrual and the
    adjustment thereto were reflected in our allocation of purchase
    price associated with the Allied acquisition and had no impact
    on our consolidated statement of income.

Exchange
    of Partnership Interests

In April 2002, Allied exchanged minority partnership interests
    in four

waste-to-energy

facilities for majority partnership interests in equipment
    purchasing businesses, which are now wholly owned subsidiaries.
    In November 2008, the IRS issued a formal disallowance to Allied
    contending that the exchange was instead a sale on which a
    corresponding gain should have been recognized. We believe our
    position is supported by relevant technical authorities and
    strong business purpose and we intend to vigorously defend our
    position on



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

this matter. Although we intend to vigorously defend our
    position on this matter, if the exchange is treated as a sale,
    we estimate it could have a potential federal and state cash tax
    impact of approximately $156 million plus accrued interest
    through December 31, 2010 of approximately
    $71 million. In addition, the IRS has asserted a penalty of
    20% of the additional income tax due. At December 31, 2010,
    the amount of the asserted penalty and penalty-related interest
    was approximately $49 million. The potential tax and
    interest (but not penalty or penalty-related interest) of a full
    adjustment for this matter have been fully reserved in our
    consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010. The
    successful assertion by the IRS of penalty and penalty-related
    interest in connection with this matter could have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and
    cash flows.

Methane
    Gas

As part of its examination of Allied’s 2000 through 2008
    federal income tax returns, the IRS reviewed Allied’s
    treatment of costs associated with its landfill operations. As a
    result of this review, the IRS has proposed that certain
    landfill costs be allocated to the collection and control of
    methane gas that is naturally produced within the landfill. The
    IRS’ position is that the methane gas produced by a
    landfill is a joint product resulting from operation of the
    landfill and, therefore, these costs should not be expensed
    until the methane gas is sold or otherwise disposed.

We have protested this matter to the Appeals Office of the IRS.
    We believe we have several meritorious defenses, including the
    fact that methane gas is not actively produced for sale by us
    but rather arises naturally in the context of providing disposal
    services. Therefore, we believe that the subsequent resolution
    of this issue will not have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

Stock-Based
    Compensation

In July 1998, we adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (1998
    Plan) to provide for grants of options to purchase shares of
    common stock, restricted stock and other equity-based
    compensation to our employees and non-employee directors who are
    eligible to participate in the 1998 Plan. The 1998 Plan expired
    on June 30, 2008. In February 2007, our board of directors
    approved the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (2007 Plan) to replace
    the 1998 Plan when it expired. The 2007 Plan was approved by our
    stockholders in May 2007. We believe that such awards better
    align the interests of our employees with those of our
    stockholders. There were 3.9 million shares reserved for
    future grants under the 2007 Plan as of December 31, 2010.

Options granted under the 1998 Plan and the 2007 Plan are
    non-qualified and are granted at a price equal to the fair
    market value of our common stock at the date of grant.
    Generally, options granted have a term of seven to ten years
    from the date of grant, and vest in increments of 25% per year
    over a four year period beginning on the first anniversary date
    of the grant. Options granted to non-employee directors have a
    term of ten years and are fully vested at the grant date.

In December 2008, the Board of Directors amended and restated
    the Republic Services, Inc. 2006 Incentive Stock Plan (formerly
    known as the Allied Waste Industries, Inc. 2006 Incentive Stock
    Plan (the 2006 Plan)). Allied’s stockholders approved the
    2006 Plan in May 2006. The 2006 Plan was amended and restated in
    December 2008 to reflect that Republic Services, Inc. is the new
    sponsor of the Plan, that any references to shares of common
    stock is to shares of common stock of Republic Services, Inc.,
    and to adjust outstanding awards and the number of shares
    available under the Plan to reflect the acquisition. The 2006
    Plan, as amended and restated, provides for the grant of
    non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, shares of
    restricted stock, shares of phantom stock, stock bonuses,
    restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance
    awards, dividend equivalents, cash awards, or other stock-based
    awards. Awards granted under the



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

2006 Plan prior to December 5, 2008 became fully vested and
    nonforfeitable upon the closing of the acquisition. Awards may
    be granted under the 2006 Plan, as amended and restated, after
    December 5, 2008 only to employees and consultants of
    Allied Waste Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries who were not
    employed by Republic Services, Inc. prior to such date. At
    December 31, 2010, there were approximately
    15.3 million shares of common stock reserved for future
    grants under the 2006 Plan.

Stock
    Options

We use a binomial option-pricing model to value our stock option
    grants. We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line
    basis over the requisite service period for each separately
    vesting portion of the award, or to the employee’s
    retirement eligible date, if earlier. Expected volatility is
    based on the weighted average of the most recent one-year
    volatility and a historical rolling average volatility of our
    stock over the expected life of the option. The risk-free
    interest rate is based on Federal Reserve rates in effect for
    bonds with maturity dates equal to the expected term of the
    option. We use historical data to estimate future option
    exercises, forfeitures and expected life of the options. When
    appropriate, separate groups of employees that have similar
    historical exercise behavior are considered separately for
    valuation purposes.

The
    weighted-average estimated fair values of stock options granted
    during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008
    were $5.28, $3.79 and $4.36 per option, respectively, which were
    calculated using the following weighted-average assumptions:

Stock options granted in 2008 primarily include stock options
    granted as part of our annual grant to employees in February
    2008, as part of our new annual grant program in December 2008
    and as grants of replacement options for Allied’s
    outstanding stock options as of the effective date of the
    acquisition, in accordance with the terms of the merger
    agreement. In December 2008, we replaced Allied’s
    outstanding, vested and unvested stock options with Republic
    stock options with similar terms and conditions, and recorded a
    credit to additional-paid-in-capital of $61.2 million as
    part of the purchase price paid for the acquisition.

Additionally, as of the effective date of the Allied
    acquisition, all of Republic’s unvested stock options
    outstanding were vested in accordance with the change in control
    provisions of the 1998 and 2007 Plans. We recorded compensation
    expense of $6.5 million in December 2008 to recognize the
    immediate vesting of the stock options.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    compensation expense for stock options was $12.8 million,
    $7.8 million and $14.0 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, total unrecognized compensation
    expense related to outstanding stock options was
    $10.1 million, which will be recognized over a weighted
    average period of 1.9 years. The total fair value of stock
    options that vested in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was
    $4.0 million, $3.9 million and $21.5 million,
    respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we awarded 92,894
    restricted stock units to our non-employee directors under our
    2007 Plan, of which 88,732 vested immediately. The remaining
    restricted stock units awarded during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 vest in three equal annual installments
    beginning on the anniversary date of the original grant. The
    directors receive the underlying shares only after their board
    service ends or a change in control occurs. During the year
    ended December 31, 2010, we awarded 210,437 restricted
    stock units to executives and other officers that vest in four
    equal annual installments beginning on the anniversary date of
    the original grant. The restricted stock units do not carry any
    voting or dividend rights, except the right to receive
    additional restricted stock units in lieu of dividends.

Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we
    awarded 64,579 shares of restricted stock to an executive
    that vest in four equal annual installments beginning on the
    anniversary date of the original grant. During the vesting
    period, the participant has voting rights and receives dividends
    declared and paid on the restricted stock, but the restricted
    stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise
    encumbered. Granted but unvested restricted stock awards are
    forfeited if the participant resigns employment with us for
    other than good reason.

During the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 we awarded
    320,354 and 36,000 restricted stock units, respectively, to our
    non-employee directors under our 1998 Plan. These restricted
    stock units vest immediately, but the directors receive the
    underlying shares only after their board service ends or a

occurs, as defined by the 1998 Plan. The restricted stock units
    do not carry any voting or dividend rights, except the right to
    receive additional stock units in lieu of dividends.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we awarded
    195,611 shares of restricted stock to executives and other
    officers and directors, of which 110,669 of the shares vested
    May 14, 2010 and 38,670 of the shares awarded vest
    effective January 31, 2012. Additionally,
    26,914 shares awarded vest in four equal annual
    installments beginning on the anniversary date of the original
    grant. The remaining 15,904 shares awarded vested during
    2009 and 3,454 shares vested during 2010. During the
    vesting period, the participants have voting rights and receive
    dividends declared and paid on the shares, but the shares may
    not be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise encumbered.
    Granted but unvested shares are forfeited if the participant
    resigns employment with us for other than good reason.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we awarded
    426,670 shares of restricted stock to our executive
    officers, of which 236,170 were granted as part of our 2007
    Stock Incentive Plan. As of the effective date of the Allied
    acquisition, all of Republic’s remaining unvested
    restricted stock outstanding was vested in accordance with the
    change in control provisions of the 1998 Plan.

The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is
    based on the closing market price on the date of the grant. The
    compensation expense related to restricted stock units and
    restricted stock is amortized ratably over the vesting period.

As of the effective date of the Allied acquisition, all of
    Republic’s outstanding and unvested restricted stock was
    vested in accordance with the change in control provisions of
    the 1998 and 2007 Plans. We recorded compensation expense of
    $5.3 million in December 2008 to recognize the immediate
    vesting of the restricted stock. In addition, the restricted
    stock units were vested and a cash payment was made totaling
    $4.0 million based on the fair value of the restricted
    stock units as of the date of vesting.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    compensation expense related to restricted stock units and
    restricted shares totaled $11.7 million, $7.2 million
    and $10.0 million, respectively.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plan

We currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan,
    the BFI Retirement Plan (the Plan). The Plan covers certain
    employees in the United States, including some employees subject
    to collective bargaining agreements.

The Plan benefits are frozen. Interest credits continue to be
    earned by participants in the Plan, and participants whose
    collective bargaining agreements provide for additional benefit
    accruals under the Plan continue to receive those credits in
    accordance with the terms of their bargaining agreements. The
    Plan was converted from a traditional defined benefit plan to a
    cash balance plan in 1993.

Prior to the conversion of the cash balance design, benefits
    payable as a single life annuity under the Plan were based on
    the participant’s highest five years of earnings out of the
    last ten years of service. Upon conversion to the cash balance
    plan, the existing accrued benefits were converted to a lump-sum
    value using the actuarial assumptions in effect at the time.
    Participants’ cash balance accounts are increased until
    retirement by certain benefit and interest credits under the
    terms of their bargaining agreements. Participants may elect
    early retirement with the attainment of age 55 and
    completion of 10 years of credited service at reduced
    benefits. Participants with 35 years of service may retire
    at age 62 without any reduction in benefits.

BFI Post
    Retirement Healthcare Plan

The BFI Post Retirement Healthcare Plan provides continued
    medical coverage for certain current and former employees
    following their retirement, including some employees subject to
    collective bargaining agreements. Eligibility for this plan is
    limited to certain employees who had ten or more years of
    service and were age 55



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO

or older as of December 31, 1998, and certain employees in
    California who were hired on or before December 31, 2005
    and who retire on or after age 55 with at least thirty
    years of service.

Multi-Employer
    Pension Plans

We contribute to 28 multi-employer pension plans under
    collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented
    employees. Approximately 22% of our total current employees are
    participants in such multi-employer plans. These plans generally
    provide retirement benefits to participants based on their
    service to contributing employers. We do not administer these
    multi-employer plans. In general, these plans are managed by a
    board of trustees with the unions appointing certain trustees
    and other contributing employers of the plan appointing certain
    members. We generally are not represented on the board of
    trustees.

Based on the information available to us, we believe that some
    of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute are either
    “critical” or “endangered” as those terms
    are defined in the Pension Protection Act enacted in 2006 (the
    PPA). The PPA requires underfunded pension plans to improve
    their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the
    level of their underfunding. Until the plan trustees develop the
    funding improvement plans or rehabilitation plans as required by
    the PPA, we are unable to determine the amount of assessments we
    may be subject to, if any. Accordingly, we cannot determine at
    this time the impact that the PPA may have on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Furthermore, under current law regarding multi-employer benefit
    plans, a plan’s termination, our voluntary withdrawal
    (which we consider from time to time), or the mass withdrawal of
    all contributing employers from any under-funded, multi-employer
    pension plan would require us to make payments to the plan for
    our proportionate share of the multi-employer plan’s
    unfunded vested liabilities. It is possible that there may be a
    mass withdrawal of employers contributing to these plans or
    plans may terminate in the near future. We could have
    adjustments to our estimates for these matters in the near term
    that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our pension expense for multi-employer plans was
    $46.9 million, $43.0 million and $21.8 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plan

Our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) provides
    retirement benefits to certain of Allied’s employees and
    former employees. SERP participants whose employment with us has
    been severed as a result of the acquisition received cash
    settlements six months following their respective separation
    dates. Benefits for SERP participants who remain with Republic
    were frozen as of the effective date of the acquisition.
    However, these active participants will continue to accrue
    interest credits at the annual rate of 6.0% until they are
    eligible for retirement. SERP participants who retired prior to
    the acquisition will continue to receive their benefits in
    accordance with the original plan provisions which allow for a
    maximum of ten years of retirement benefits equal to 60% of each
    participant’s respective average base salary during the
    three consecutive full calendar years of employment immediately
    preceding their date of retirement. At December 31, 2010,
    there were one retired and two active participants in the plan.
    As the SERP is frozen, no assumptions are made about future
    compensation levels, and as such, there is no difference between
    the projected benefit and the accumulated benefit obligation.

We also assumed post-retirement medical obligations associated
    with the SERP totaling $1.8 million as of the acquisition
    date. Medical liabilities were $1.4 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 and are included in the post
    retirement healthcare amounts in the table below.

We are required to separately recognize the overfunded or
    underfunded status of our pension and other post retirement
    employee benefit plans as an asset or liability. The funded
    status represents the difference between the projected benefit
    obligation (PBO) and the fair value of the plan assets. The PBO
    is the present value of



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the
    effect of assumed future salary increases, if any. The PBO is
    equal to the accumulated benefit obligation as the present value
    of these liabilities is not affected by assumed future salary
    increases. We use a measurement date that coincides with our
    year end of December 31.

The following table presents the accumulated benefit obligation
    and reconciliations of the changes in the projected benefit
    obligations, the plan assets and the accounting funded status of
    our defined benefit pension plan, SERP and post retirement
    healthcare plans for the years ended December 31, 2010 and
    2009.

We determine the discount rate used in the measurement of our
    obligations based on a model that matches the timing and amount
    of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds
    priced as of the pension plan measurement date. Where that
    timing does not correspond to a published high-quality bond
    rate, our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an
    appropriate current discount rate. The yields on the bonds are
    used to derive a discount rate for the liability. The term of
    our obligation, based on the expected retirement dates of our
    workforce, is approximately ten years.

In developing our expected rate of return assumption, we have
    evaluated the actual historical performance and long-term return
    projections of the Plan assets, which give consideration to the
    asset mix and the anticipated timing of the pension plan
    outflows. We employ a total return investment approach whereby a
    mix of equity and fixed income investments are used to maximize
    the long-term return of plan assets for what we consider a
    prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to
    minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over
    the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful
    consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and our
    financial condition. The investment portfolio contains a
    diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
    Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across
    U.S. and

non-U.S. stocks

as well as growth, value, and small and large capitalizations.
    Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient
    and timely manner. However, derivatives may not be used to
    leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying
    investments. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an
    ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic
    asset and liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio
    reviews.

A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost
    trend rate would not have a material impact on the service and
    interest costs and would increase our postretirement benefit
    obligation by $0.1 million at December 31, 2010. A one
    percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend
    rate would



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

decrease the service and interest costs by less than
    $0.1 million and would decrease our postretirement benefit
    obligation by $0.1 million at December 31, 2010.

Our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding
    standards established by Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the PPA. We
    made a $10.0 million voluntary contribution to the Plan in
    2010. No contributions were made in either 2009 or 2008, and we
    do not anticipate making any contributions during 2011.

The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to maintain a
    broadly diversified portfolio designed to achieve our target of
    an average long-term rate of return of 7.25%. While we believe
    we can achieve a long-term average return of 7.25%, we cannot be
    certain that the portfolio will perform to our expectations.
    Assets are strategically allocated among debt and equity
    portfolios in order to achieve a diversification level that
    dampens fluctuations in investment returns. Asset allocation
    target ranges and strategies are reviewed periodically with the
    assistance of an independent external consulting firm.

The pension assets are valued at fair value. The following is a
    description of the valuation methodologies used for the
    investments measured at fair value, including the general
    classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation
    hierarchy.

•

Money market accounts are valued at the net asset value of
    shares held by the Plan at year end. These investments are
    classified as Level 2 investments.

•

Registered Investment Companies are mutual funds and other
    commingled funds registered with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission. Mutual funds are traded actively on public
    exchanges. The share prices for mutual funds are published at
    the close of each business day. Holdings of mutual funds are
    classified as Level 1 investments. Other registered
    commingled funds are not publicly traded, but underlying assets
    (stocks and bonds) held in these funds are traded on active
    markets and the prices for these assets are readily observable.
    Holdings in other registered commingled funds are classified as
    Level 2 investments.

•

Limited partnerships invest in privately-held companies or
    privately held real estate assets. Due to the private nature of
    the partnership investments, pricing inputs are not readily
    observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general
    partners that manage the partnerships. These valuations are
    based on property appraisals, application of public market
    multiples to private company cash flows, utilization of market
    transactions that provide valuation information for comparable
    companies and other methods. Holdings of limited partnership
    interests are classified as Level 3 investments.

    which is a defined contribution plan covering all eligible
    employees. Under the provisions of the 401(k) Plan, participants
    may direct us to defer a portion of their compensation to the
    401(k) Plan, subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations. We
    provide for an employer matching contribution equal to 100% of
    the first 3% of eligible compensation and 50% of the next

In conjunction with the Allied acquisition, we acquired the
    Allied 401(k) Plan. Participants in the Allied 401(k) Plan are
    eligible for the same employer matching contribution as those
    under the 401(k) Plan effective January 1, 2009. Effective
    July 1, 2009, the 401(k) Plan and the Allied 401(k) Plan
    were merged to form the Republic Services, Inc. 401(k) Plan.

Total expense recorded for matching 401(k) contributions in
    2010, 2009 and 2008 was $32.8 million, $30.5 million
    and $16.8 million, respectively.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

Employees of Republic are eligible to participate in an employee
    stock purchase plan. The plan allows participants to purchase
    the Company’s common stock for 95% of its quoted market
    price on the last day of each calendar quarter. For the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, issuances under
    this plan totaled 123,523 shares, 49,918 shares and
    84,918 shares, respectively. At December 31, 2010,
    shares reserved for issuance to employees under this plan
    totaled 1.3 million and Republic held employee
    contributions of approximately $0.9 million for the
    purchase of common stock.

    Compensation Plans

Our compensation program includes a management incentive plan,
    which uses certain performance metrics such as free cash flow,
    earnings per share and return on invested capital to measure
    performance. In addition, in connection with the Allied
    acquisition, our board of directors has approved a synergy
    incentive plan that provides compensation that depends on our
    achieving targeted synergies of approximately $150 million
    by the end of 2010. Incentive awards are payable in cash.

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

From 2000 through 2008, our board of directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $2.6 billion of our common stock. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had paid $2.3 billion to
    repurchase 82.6 million shares of our common stock, of
    which 4.6 million shares were acquired during the year
    ended December 31, 2008 for $138.4 million. During the
    second quarter of 2008, we suspended our share repurchase
    program as a result of the pending Allied acquisition.

In November 2010, our board of directors approved a share
    repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to
    $400.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock.
    As of December 31, 2010, we used $41.1 million under
    the program to repurchase 1.4 million shares at an average
    cost per share of $28.46. We expect to use the remaining funds
    in this program to repurchase shares during 2011.

We initiated a quarterly cash dividend in July 2003. The
    dividend has been increased from time to time thereafter. In
    July 2010, the board of directors approved an increase in the
    quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share. Cash dividends declared
    were $298.8 million, $288.7 million and
    $168.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, we
    recorded a quarterly dividend payable of $76.7 million to
    stockholders of record at the close of business on
    January 3, 2011.

EARNINGS
    PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares (including
    restricted stock and vested but unissued restricted stock units)
    outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is
    based on the combined weighted average number of common shares
    and common share equivalents outstanding which include, where
    appropriate, the assumed exercise of employee stock

    restricted stock units. In computing diluted earnings per share,
    we utilize the treasury stock method.

Intercompany revenue reflects transactions within and between
    segments that are generally made on a basis intended to reflect
    the market value of such services.

Depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion includes net
    decreases in amortization expense of $10.2 and $5.1 million
    recorded during 2010 and 2009, respectively, and a net increase
    of $0.6 million in 2008, related to changes in estimates
    and assumptions concerning the cost and timing of future final
    capping, closure and post-closure activities.

The following items are included in the above segment
    information:

•

Eastern Region.

For the year ended

Other revenue consists primarily of sales of recycled materials
    and revenue from National Accounts acquired from Allied.
    National Accounts revenue included in other revenue represents
    the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in
    markets outside our operating areas, and, as such, the
    associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local
    operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is
    offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost
    of operations.

Fuel
    Hedges

We have entered into multiple swap agreements designated as cash
    flow hedges to mitigate some of our exposure related to changes
    in diesel fuel prices. The swaps qualified for, and were
    designated as, effective hedges of changes in the prices of
    forecasted diesel fuel purchases (fuel hedges).

If the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon
    of diesel fuel (average price) as published by the Department of
    Energy exceeds the contract price per gallon, we receive the
    difference between the average price and the contract price
    (multiplied by the notional gallons) from the counter-party. If
    the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of
    diesel fuel is less than the contract price per gallon, we pay
    the difference to the counter-party.

The fair values of our fuel hedges are obtained from third-party
    counter-parties and are determined using standard option
    valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being
    based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in
    the fair value hierarchy). The aggregated fair values of our
    outstanding fuel hedges at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were
    current assets of $1.6 million and $3.2 million,
    respectively, and current liabilities of $1.9 million and
    $4.9 million, respectively, and have been recorded in other
    current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated
    balance sheets, respectively.

The effective portions of the changes in fair values as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, net of tax, of
    $0.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, have been
    recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portions
    of the changes in fair values as of December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008 were immaterial and have been recorded in other income
    (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income.
    Realized (losses) gains of $(2.0) million,
    $(7.3) million and $5.9 million related to these fuel
    hedges are included in cost of operations in our consolidated
    statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2010,

Recycling
    Commodity Hedges

Our revenue from sale of recycling commodities is primarily from
    sales of old corrugated cardboard (OCC) and old newspaper (ONP).
    We use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars
    designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes
    in prices of these commodities. We have entered into multiple
    agreements related to the forecasted OCC and ONP sales. The
    agreements qualified for, and were designated as, effective
    hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted commodity
    sales (commodity hedges).

price (multiplied by the notional short tons) from the
    counter-party. If the price of the commodity exceeds the
    contract price per short ton, we pay the difference to the
    counter-party.

The fair values of our commodity swaps are obtained from
    third-party counter-parties and are determined using standard
    option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices
    being based on those observed in underlying markets
    (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).

On December 8, 2010, we entered into a two-year costless
    collar agreement on forecasted sales of 10,000 short tons of OCC
    a month. The agreement involves combining a purchased put option
    giving us the right to sell 10,000 short tons of OCC monthly for
    24 months at an established floor strike price with a
    written call option obligating us to deliver 10,000 short tons
    of OCC monthly for 24 months at an established cap strike
    price. The puts and calls have the same settlement dates, are
    net settled in cash on such dates and have the same terms to
    expiration. The contemporaneous combination of options resulted
    in no net premium for us and represents a costless collar. Under
    the agreement, no payment would be made or received by us, as
    long as the settlement price is between the floor price and cap
    price. However, if the settlement price is above the cap, we
    would be required to pay the counterparty an amount equal to the
    excess of the settlement price over the cap times the monthly
    volumes hedged. Also, if the settlement price is below the
    floor, the counterparty would be required to pay us the deficit
    of the settlement price below the floor times the monthly
    volumes hedged. The objective of this agreement is to reduce the
    variability of the cash flows of the forecasted sales of OCC
    between two designated strike prices.

The costless collar hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at
    fair value. The fair values of the costless collars are obtained
    from the third-party counter-party and are determined using
    standard option valuation models with assumptions about
    commodity prices based upon forward commodity price curves in
    underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).

The aggregated fair values of the outstanding commodity hedges
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were current assets of
    $1.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, and
    current liabilities of $6.5 million and $0.8 million,
    respectively, and have been recorded in other current assets and
    other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets,
    respectively.

The effective portions of the changes in fair values of our
    commodity hedges as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, net of
    tax, of $(2.6) million and $0.6 million have been
    recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portions
    of the changes in fair values as of December 31, 2010 and
    2009 were immaterial and have been recorded in other income
    (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In measuring fair values of assets and liabilities, we use
    valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs
    (Level 1) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    (Level 3). Also, we use market data or assumptions that we
    believe market participants would use in pricing an asset or
    liability, including assumptions about risk when appropriate.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our assets and
    liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
    include the following:

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

General
    Legal Proceedings

We are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations
    and have implemented our own safeguards to respond to regulatory
    requirements. In the normal course of conducting our operations,
    we become involved in legal proceedings. Some of these actions
    may result in fines, penalties or judgments against us, which
    may impact earnings and cash flows for a particular period.
    Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any legal
    matter with certainty, except as described below or in
    Note 10,

Income Taxes

, in the discussion of our
    outstanding tax dispute with the IRS, we do not believe that the
    outcome of our pending legal proceedings will have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

As used herein, legal proceedings refers to litigation and
    similar claims against us and our subsidiaries, excluding:
    (i) ordinary course accidents, general commercial liability
    and workers compensation claims, which are covered by insurance
    programs, subject to customary deductibles, and which, together
    with self-insured employee health care costs, are discussed in
    Note 7,

Other Liabilities-Self-Insurance Reserves

;
    (ii) tax-related matters, which are discussed in
    Note 10,

Income Taxes;

and (iii) environmental
    remediation liabilities, which are discussed in Note 8,

Landfill and Environmental Costs.

We accrue for legal proceedings when losses become probable and
    reasonably estimable. We have recorded an aggregate accrual of
    approximately $113 million relating to our outstanding
    legal proceedings as of December 31, 2010, including those
    described herein and others not specifically identified herein.
    As of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review
    each of our legal proceedings and, where it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred, we accrue for all probable and
    reasonably estimable losses. Where we are able to reasonably
    estimate a range of losses we may incur with respect to such a
    matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range
    that constitutes our best estimate. If we are able to reasonably
    estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a
    better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the
    low end of such range. If we used the high ends of such ranges,
    our aggregate potential liability would have been approximately
    $121 million higher than the amount recorded as of
    December 31, 2010.

Countywide
    Matters

In September 2009, Republic Services of Ohio II, LLC
    (Republic-Ohio) entered into Final Findings and Orders with the
    Ohio Environmental Protection Agency that require us to
    implement a comprehensive operation and maintenance program to
    manage the remediation area at the Countywide Recycling and
    Disposal Facility (Countywide). The remediation liability for
    Countywide recorded as of December 31, 2010 is
    $68.4 million, of which $7.1 million is expected to be
    paid during 2011. The reasonably possible range of loss for
    remediation costs is $59 million to $81 million.

In a suit filed on October 8, 2008 in the Tuscarawas County
    Ohio Court of Common Pleas, approximately 700 individuals and
    businesses located in the area around Countywide sued Republic
    Services, Inc. and Republic-Ohio for alleged negligence and
    nuisance. Republic-Ohio has owned and operated Countywide since
    February 1, 1999. Waste Management, Inc. and Waste
    Management Ohio, Inc., previous owners and operators of
    Countywide, have been named as defendants as well. Plaintiffs
    allege that due to the acceptance of a specific waste stream and
    operational issues and conditions, the landfill has generated
    odors and other unsafe emissions that have impaired the use and
    value of their property and may have adverse health effects. A
    second almost identical lawsuit was filed by approximately 82
    plaintiffs on October 13, 2009 in the Tuscarawas County
    Ohio Court of Common Pleas against Republic Services, Inc.,
    Republic-Ohio, Waste Management, Inc., and Waste Management
    Ohio, Inc. The court has consolidated the two actions. We have
    assumed both the defense and the liability of the Waste
    Management entities in the consolidated action. The relief
    requested on behalf of each plaintiff in the consolidated action
    is: (1) an award of compensatory damages according to proof
    in an amount in excess of $25,000 for each of the three counts
    of the amended complaint; (2) an award of punitive damages
    in the amount of two times compensatory damages, pursuant to
    applicable statute, or in such amount as may be awarded at trial
    for each of the three counts of the amended complaint;
    (3) costs for medical screening and monitoring of each
    plaintiff; (4) interest on the damages according to law;
    (5) costs and disbursements of the lawsuit;
    (6) reasonable fees for attorneys and expert witnesses; and
    (7) any other and further relief as the court deems just,
    proper and equitable. Plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated
    complaint on September 9, 2010, which no longer asserts a
    claim for medical monitoring. As a result of various dismissals
    of plaintiffs, this case presently consists of approximately 600
    plaintiffs. Discovery is ongoing. We will vigorously defend
    against the plaintiffs’ allegations in the consolidated
    action.

Luri
    Matter

On August 17, 2007, a former employee, Ronald Luri, sued
    Republic Services, Inc., Republic Services of Ohio Hauling LLC,
    Republic Services of Ohio I LLC, Jim Bowen and Ron Krall in the
    Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court in Ohio. Plaintiff alleges
    that he was unlawfully fired in retaliation for refusing to
    discharge or demote three employees who were all over
    50 years old. On July 3, 2008, a jury verdict was
    awarded against us in the amount of $46.6 million,
    including $43.1 million in punitive damages. On
    September 24, 2008, the Court awarded pre-judgment interest
    of $0.3 million and attorney fees and litigation costs of
    $1.1 million. Post-judgment interest accrued at a rate of
    8% for 2008 and 5% for 2009, and is accruing at a rate of 4% for
    2010. Management anticipates that post-judgment interest could
    accrue through the middle of 2011 for a total of
    $7.7 million. We have filed a notice of appeal, and the
    case has been fully briefed in the Court of Appeals. It is
    reasonably possible that following all appeals a final judgment
    of liability for compensatory and punitive damages may be
    assessed against us related to this matter.

Litigation
    Related to Fuel and Environmental Fees

On July 8, 2009, CLN Properties, Inc. and Maevers
    Management Company, Inc. filed a complaint against Republic
    Services, Inc. and Allied Waste Industries, Inc. in the United
    States District Court in Arizona, in which plaintiffs complain
    about fuel recovery fees and environmental recovery fees. The
    complaint purports to



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

be filed on behalf of a nationwide class of similarly situated
    plaintiffs. The complaint asserts various legal and equitable
    theories of recovery and alleges in essence that the fees were
    not properly disclosed, were unfair, and were contrary to
    contract. The District Court denied plaintiffs’ motion for
    class certification on December 13, 2010. Plaintiffs filed
    a motion for reconsideration of that ruling, which the District
    Court also denied. Plaintiffs have not filed a timely
    interlocutory appeal, but could file an appeal after any
    judgment in this case. Based on the strength of the District
    Court’s opinion and the small amounts at issue with respect
    to the 10 remaining plaintiffs, we will no longer report on this
    case after this

Form 10-K.

On July 23, 2009, Klingler’s European Bake
    Shop & Deli, Inc., filed a complaint against BFI Waste
    Services, LLC in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama,
    in which plaintiff complains about fuel/environmental recovery
    fees and administrative fees charged. The complaint purports to
    be filed on behalf of a class of similarly situated plaintiffs
    in Alabama. This complaint asserts various legal and equitable
    theories of recovery and alleges in essence that the fees were
    not properly disclosed, were unfair, and were contrary to
    contract.

Class-certification-related

discovery is underway. Plaintiff’s deadline for moving for
    class certification is August 12, 2011.

The plaintiffs in both actions have not specified the amount of
    damages sought. Although the range of reasonably possible loss
    cannot be estimated, we do not believe that these matters will
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial positions,
    results of operations or cash flows. We will continue to
    vigorously defend the claims in both lawsuits.

Contracting
    Matter

We discovered actions of non-compliance by one of our
    subsidiaries with the subcontracting provisions of certain
    government contracts in one of our markets. We reported the
    discovery to, and expect further discussions with, law
    enforcement authorities and other authorities. Such
    non-compliance could result in payments by us in the form of
    restitution, damages, or penalties, or the loss of future
    business in the affected market or markets. Based on the
    information currently available to us, including our expectation
    that our self-disclosure will be viewed favorably by the
    applicable authorities, we presently believe that the resolution
    of the matter, while it may have a material impact on our
    results of operations or cash flows in the period in which it is
    recognized or paid, will not have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial position.

Congress
    Development Landfill Matters

Congress Development Co. (CDC) is a general partnership
    that owns and operates the Congress Landfill. The general
    partners in CDC are our subsidiary, Allied Waste Transportation,
    Inc. (Allied Transportation), and an unaffiliated entity, John
    Sexton Sand & Gravel Corporation (Sexton). Sexton was
    the operator of the landfill through early 2007, when Allied
    Transportation took over as the operator. The general partners
    likely will be jointly and severally liable for the costs
    associated with the following matters relating to the Congress
    Landfill.

In August 2010, Congress Development Company agreed with the
    State of Illinois to have a Final Consent Order (Final Order)
    entered by the Circuit Court of Illinois, Cook County. Pursuant
    to the Final Order, we have agreed to continue to implement
    certain remedial activities at the Congress Landfill. The
    remediation liability recorded as of December 31, 2010 is
    $82.6 million, of which $8.4 million is expected to be
    paid during 2011. The reasonably possible range of loss for
    remediation costs is $46 million to $146 million.

In a suit originally filed on December 23, 2009 in the
    Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois and subsequently amended
    to add additional plaintiffs, approximately 2,300 plaintiffs
    sued our subsidiaries Allied Transportation and Allied Waste
    Industries, Inc., CDC and Sexton. The plaintiffs allege bodily
    injury, property damage and inability to have normal use and
    enjoyment of property arising from, among other things, odors
    and other damages arising from landfill gas leaking, and they
    base their claims on negligence, trespass, and nuisance.



REPUBLIC
    SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

Following the court’s order in our favor striking the
    plaintiffs’ allegations requesting actual damages in excess
    of $50,000,000 and punitive damages in excess of $50,000,000,
    the amount of damages being sought is unspecified. The court
    entered an order dismissing Allied Waste Industries, Inc.
    without prejudice on October 26, 2010. We intend to
    vigorously defend against the plaintiffs’ allegations in
    this action.

Livingston
    Matter

On October 13, 2009, the Twenty-First Judicial District
    Court, Parish of Livingston, State of Louisiana, issued its Post
    Class Certification Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
    in a lawsuit alleging nuisance from the activities of the CECOS
    hazardous waste facility located in Livingston Parish,
    Louisiana. The court granted class certification for all those
    living within a six mile radius of the CECOS site between the
    years 1977 and 1990. We have filed a notice of appeal with
    respect to the class certification order and briefing is
    complete. The parties have held one mediation session and expect
    to continue that session in April 2011. If the mediation is not
    successful, we intend to continue to defend this lawsuit
    vigorously.

Lease
    Commitments

We and our subsidiaries lease real property, equipment and
    software under various operating leases with terms from one
    month to twenty years. Rent expense during the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $51.6 million,
    $60.1 million and $19.3 million, respectively.

Future minimum lease obligations under non-cancelable operating
    leases with initial terms in excess of one year at
    December 31, 2010 are as follows:

Royalties

We have entered into agreements to pay royalties to prior
    landowners, lessors or host communities, based on waste tonnage
    disposed at specified landfills. These royalties are generally
    payable quarterly and amounts incurred, but not paid, are
    accrued in our consolidated balance sheets. Royalties are
    accrued as tonnage is disposed of in the landfills.

Disposal
    Agreements

We have several agreements expiring at various dates through
    2029 that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at
    third-party disposal facilities. Under these

put-or-pay

agreements, we are required to pay for

agreed-upon

minimum volumes regardless of the actual number of tons placed
    at the facilities.

Restricted
    Cash and Other Financial Guarantees

We must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and
    a variety of other entities under applicable environmental
    regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping,
    closure and post-closure costs, and our performance under
    certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts. We
    satisfy our financial assurance requirements by providing surety
    bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies or trust deposits.
    The amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping,
    closure and post-closure costs is determined by applicable state
    environmental regulations, which vary by state. The financial
    assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure
    costs can either be for costs associated with a portion of the
    landfill or the entire landfill. Generally, states will require
    a third-party engineering specialist to determine the estimated
    capping, closure and post-closure costs that are used to
    determine the required amount of financial assurance for a
    landfill. The amount of financial assurance required can, and
    generally will, differ from the obligation determined and
    recorded under GAAP. The amount of the financial assurance
    requirements related to contract performance varies by contract.
    Additionally, we are required to provide financial assurance for
    our self-insurance program and collateral for certain
    performance obligations.

We had the following financial instruments and collateral in
    place to secure our financial assurances at December 31:

1,673.5

Surety bonds

The letters of credit utilize $1,037.5 million and
    $1,634.0 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, of availability under our Credit Facilities.
    Surety bonds expire on various dates through 2038.

These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of
    business and are not debt. Because we currently have no
    liability for this financial assurance, it is not reflected in
    our consolidated balance sheets. However, we have recorded
    capping, closure and post-closure obligations and self-insurance
    reserves as they are incurred. The underlying financial
    assurance obligations, in excess of those already reflected in
    our consolidated balance sheets, would be recorded if it is
    probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related
    obligations. We do not expect this to occur.

Our restricted cash deposits include, among other things,
    restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt
    facilities, and restricted cash pledged to regulatory agencies
    and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our
    performance related to our final capping, closure and
    post-closure obligations at our landfills

We own a 19.9% interest in a company that, among other

    the solid waste industry. We account for this investment under
    the cost method of accounting. There have been no identified
    events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant
    adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. This
    investee company and the parent company of the investee had
    written surety bonds for us relating to our landfill operations
    for capping, closure and post-closure, of which
    $855.0 million and $775.2 million were outstanding as
    of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our
    reimbursement obligations under these bonds are secured by an
    indemnity agreement with the investee and letters of credit
    totaling $45.0 million and $67.4 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other
    than operating leases and the financial assurances discussed
    above, which are not classified as debt. We have no transactions
    or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed,
    consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial
    position or results of operations. We have not guaranteed any
    third-party debt.

Guarantees

We enter into contracts in the normal course of business that
    include indemnification clauses. Indemnifications relating to
    known liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial
    statements based on our best estimate of required future
    payments. Certain of these indemnifications relate to contingent
    events or occurrences, such as the imposition of additional
    taxes due to a change in the tax law or adverse interpretation
    of the tax law, and indemnifications made in divestiture
    agreements where we indemnify the buyer for liabilities that
    relate to our activities prior to the divestiture and that may
    become known in the future. We do not believe that these
    contingent obligations will have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

We have entered into agreements with property owners to
    guarantee the value of property that is adjacent to certain of
    our landfills. These agreements have varying terms. We do not
    believe that these contingent obligations will have a material
    effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Other
    Matters

Our business activities are conducted in the context of a
    developing and changing statutory and regulatory framework.
    Governmental regulation of the waste management industry
    requires us to obtain and retain numerous governmental permits
    to conduct various aspects of our operations. These permits are
    subject to revocation, modification or denial. The costs and
    other capital expenditures which may be required to obtain or
    retain the applicable permits or comply with applicable
    regulations could be significant. Any revocation, modification
    or denial of permits could have a material adverse effect on us.

Costs to achieve synergies relate to those incremental costs
    incurred primarily for our synergy incentive plan as well as
    other integration costs. We also recorded losses on early
    extinguishment of debt associated with premiums paid to
    repurchase debt, charges for unamortized debt discounts and
    professional fees paid to effectuate the repurchases.

CONDENSED
    CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We are the primary obligor under certain of the Senior Notes
    issued by us. However, we have no independent assets or
    operations, and therefore substantially all of our subsidiaries
    have jointly and severally guaranteed these notes. All of the
    subsidiary guarantors are 100% direct or indirect wholly owned
    subsidiaries of the parent, and all guarantees are full,
    unconditional and joint and several with respect to principal,
    interest and liquidated damages, if any. As such, we present
    condensed consolidating balance sheets as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and condensed consolidating statements of income
    and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008 for each of Republic Services, Inc. (Parent), guarantor
    subsidiaries and the other non-guarantor subsidiaries with any
    consolidating adjustments.

ITEM 9. CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON REPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.’S INTERNAL CONTROL
    OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We, as members of management of Republic Services, Inc. are
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
    Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
    management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable
    assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that
    could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control
    systems and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of
    the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
    of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
    issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

We, under the supervision of and with the participation of our
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
    Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, assessed the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria for effective
    internal control over financial reporting described in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, we concluded that
    we maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the specified
    criteria.

Our internal control over financial reporting has been audited
    by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is
    included herein.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(e),

and

15d-15(e))

as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based
    upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
    this Annual Report.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Based on an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, there has been no change in
    our internal control over financial reporting during our last
    fiscal quarter identified in connection with that evaluation,
    that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
