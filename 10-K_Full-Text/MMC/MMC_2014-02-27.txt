REGULATION

The Company's activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under United States federal and state laws, as well as laws of other countries in which the Company's subsidiaries operate. See Part I, Item 1A (“Risk Factors”) below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses.

Risk and Insurance Services

.  While laws and regulations vary from location to location, every state of the United States and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers (such as insurance brokers, agents and consultants, reinsurance brokers, managing general agents and third party administrators) to hold an individual and/or company license from a governmental agency or self-regulatory organization. Some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locally-owned business entities; in those instances, if the Company has no licensed subsidiary, it may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction. Such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process. Licensing of reinsurance intermediary brokers is generally less rigorous as compared to insurance regulation, and most jurisdictions require only corporate reinsurance intermediary licenses.

Beginning in January 2005, all European Union member states were required to implement the Insurance Mediation Directive. This Directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance and reinsurance intermediaries, including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence, financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance. The adoption by member states of the European Union of regulations to comply with the Directive has led our insurance intermediary operations in the European Union to become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements. In January 2005, as part of the implementation of the Directive in the United Kingdom, the power and responsibilities of the Financial Services Authority ("FSA") were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the United Kingdom. In April 2013, the FSA was superseded by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). In April 2014, the FCA’s responsibilities will be further expanded to include the regulation of consumer credit activities (such as offering financing for consumers to meet their premiums).


Insurance authorities in the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which the Company's subsidiaries do business, including the FCA in the United Kingdom, also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them, and generally apply to both the insurance and reinsurance business.  The rules in the United Kingdom are currently being reviewed by the FCA with changes intended to provide enhanced protection to customer funds expected in the first quarter of 2014.

Certain of the Company's Risk and Insurance Services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment, securities and futures licensing authorities. In the United States, Marsh and Guy Carpenter use the services of MMC Securities Corp., a broker-dealer, investment adviser and introducing broker, registered in the U.S. with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), the National Futures Association and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC"), primarily in connection with investment banking-related services relating to insurance-linked and alternative risk financing transactions. Also in the United States, Marsh uses the services of NIA Securities, LLC, a U.S. registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA and SIPC. In the United Kingdom, Marsh and Guy Carpenter utilize the expertise of GC Securities, part of MMC Securities (Europe) Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the FCA to provide advice on securities and investments, including mergers & acquisitions in the European Union. MMC Securities Corp., MMC Securities (Europe) Limited, NIA Securities, LLC, and Marsh Investment Services Limited are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

In some jurisdictions, insurance-related taxes may be due either directly from clients or from the insurance broker. In the latter case, the broker customarily looks to the client for payment.

Consulting

.

Certain of Mercer's retirement-related consulting and investment services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries, including by the SEC in the United States and the FCA in the United Kingdom. In addition, the trustee services, investment services (including advice to persons, institutions and other entities on the investment of pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities) and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are also subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions, including the Department of Labor and the CFTC in the United States, and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. In the United States, Mercer provides investment services through Mercer Investment Management, Inc. and Mercer Investment Consulting, Inc., each a registered investment adviser.  Mercer Trust Company, a New Hampshire chartered trust bank, provides services for Mercer’s benefits administration and investment management business in the United States. The benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our Risk and Insurance Services businesses. Mercer uses the services of MMC Securities Corp. with the provision of certain retirement and employee benefit services. Oliver Wyman Group uses the services of MMC Securities Corp. (in the United States) and MMC Securities (Europe) Limited (in the European Union), primarily in connection with corporate finance advisory services.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

The Company faces strong competition in all of its businesses from providers of similar products and services, including competition with regard to identifying and pursuing acquisition candidates. The Company also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees. In addition to the discussion below, see “Risks Relating to the Company Generally-Competitive Risks,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

Risk and Insurance Services

.  The Company's combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope. The principal bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance

businesses compete include the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. The Company encounters strong competition from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market,


distribute and service their insurance and reinsurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants, that provide risk-related services and products.

Certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance (including captive insurance companies) as a supplement or alternative to third-party insurance, thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements. Certain insureds also obtain coverage directly from insurance providers. There are also many other providers of affinity group and private client services, including specialized firms, insurance companies and other institutions.

.  The Company's consulting and HR outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies, as well as regional and local firms. These businesses compete generally on the basis of the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. Competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms, as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms.

Mercer's investments business faces competition from many sources, including multi-manager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions. In many cases, clients have the option of handling the services provided by Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group internally, without assistance from outside advisors.

Item 1A.      Risk Factors

You should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report. These risks have the potential to materially adversely affect the Company

'

s business, results of operations or financial condition.

RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY GENERALLY

Legal and Regulatory Issues

We are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from

“

errors and omissions

”

claims.

Our operating companies provide numerous professional services, including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting, actuarial and other services for corporate and public clients around the world. As a result of these activities, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions, or

“

E&O

”

claims. In our Risk and Insurance Services segment, such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to adequately place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients. In our Consulting segment, such claims include allegations of damages arising from our actuarial, consulting, investments, pension administration and other services, which frequently involve (1) assumptions and estimates concerning contingent future events, (2) drafting and interpretation of complex documentation governing pension plans, (3) calculating benefits within complicated pension structures and (4) the provision of investment advice and management of client assets. Given the long-tail nature of professional liability claims, E&O matters often relate to services provided by the Company dating back many years. E&O claims may seek damages, including punitive and treble damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant and subject us to liability for


monetary damages, negative publicity, and reputational harm and divert personnel and management resources. The Company has varying levels of third-party insurance coverage, with policy limits and coverage terms varying significantly by policy year.

In establishing liabilities for E&O claims in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic No.

450-20 (Contingencies

-

Loss Contingencies), the Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses. A liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Nevertheless, given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company

'

s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.

Further, as more fully described in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item

8 of this report, we are subject to legal proceedings, regulatory investigations and other contingencies other than E&O claims which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign laws and regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, the European Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, we are subject to regulation by foreign and domestic governments, regulatory agencies such as the SEC in the United States and the FCA in the United Kingdom, and self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA, as further described above under Part I, Item


-

Business (Regulation) of this report. The foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations are complex and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance, limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. These laws and regulations include trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and similar local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act in the U.S., as well as import and export restrictions.

We are subject to additional federal, state and other rules and regulations, including those required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  Compliance with the requirements of these laws and regulations, among others, may be costly and adversely affect our business.

While we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those referred to above, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, loss of an operating license or approval, increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company by exposing us to negative publicity and reputational damage or by harming our client or employee relationships.

In most jurisdictions, government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret or amend applicable laws and regulations, and have discretion to grant, renew and revoke various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities. Such authorities may require the Company to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations. In some areas of our businesses, we act on the basis of our own or the industry

'

s interpretations of applicable laws or regulations, which may conflict from


state to state or country to country. In the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities, we might be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities. Moreover, the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate, which could increase the likelihood of our businesses being non-compliant in one or more jurisdictions.

The method by which insurance intermediaries are compensated has received substantial scrutiny from regulators in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest. The potential for conflicts of interest arises when an intermediary is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions. The vast majority of the compensation that Marsh receives is in the form of retail commissions and fees. The amount of compensation that we receive from insurance companies, separate from retail commissions and fees, has increased substantially in the last several years. This compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions in parts of our operations. Future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these revenue streams. In addition, these revenues present potential regulatory, litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged conflicts of interest or allegations under antitrust, competition and other laws. Adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our client, insurer or other relationships.

Finally, government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could displace insurance or reinsurance currently available from the private market and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary data, whether due to human error, misuse of information by employees or vendors, or as a result of cyberattacks, could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could have an adverse effect on our business or operations.

We maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our company, our employees and our clients.  This information includes personally identifiable information, protected health information and financial information. In many jurisdictions, particularly in the U.S. and the European Union, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of this information. These laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third-party vendors.

Data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws, rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate. There is a growing body of international data protection laws, which, in part, includes security breach notification obligations, more stringent operational requirements and significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, legislators in the U.S. are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broad-based cyberattacks at a number of companies. These and similar initiatives around the world would add to our IT and compliance costs. Our failure to adhere to, or successfully implement processes in response to, changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage to our reputation in the marketplace, as well as the general risks described herein relating to our compliance systems and controls.

We maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance or cyberattacks that could result in improper access to or misuse of confidential, personal or proprietary information. In addition, significant costs are involved with maintaining system safeguards for our technology infrastructure. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, including in connection with the integration of acquisitions, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access.


With respect to our commercial arrangements with third-party vendors, we have processes designed to require third-party IT outsourcing, offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information. However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a vendor’s employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes, or a cyberattack on a vendor’s information systems.

We have experienced data incidents, including breaches, resulting from human error as well as attempts at unauthorized access to our systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our business or operations. In the future, the cost associated with human error, the misuse of information by employees or vendors, or a major cyberattack related to our systems (including costs relating to notification of data security breaches and costs of credit monitoring services) could be substantial. Furthermore, the use of mobile technologies and social media by employees and third parties, and the speed at which information can be widely distributed, increases the risks associated with the intentional or unintentional distribution of confidential, personal or proprietary information. Improper access to or disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts, as well as laws and regulations, resulting in increased legal and other costs, disruption of our operations and loss of revenue.

Financial Risks

Our pension obligations may cause the Company

'

s earnings and cash flows to fluctuate.

The Company has significant pension obligations to its current and former employees, totaling approximately $13.5 billion and related plan assets of approximately $13.6 billion at December 31, 2013. The Company

'

s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by U.S. law and the laws of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Company offers defined benefit plans. In the U.S., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines. Contribution rates for non-U.S. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ from measurements under U.S. GAAP. In the U.K., for example, contributions to defined benefit pension plans are determined through a negotiation process between the Company and the plans' trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans.

This process is governed by U.K. pension regulations. The assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for U.S. GAAP and currently result in a lower funded status than under U.S. GAAP.

During 2013, the Company contributed $26 million to its U.S. pension plans and $620 million to non-U.S. pension plans.  As more fully described in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, funding amounts will be impacted by future asset performance, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In accordance with ASC Topic No. 715, the Company reflects the over- or under-funded amount of its pension plans as assets or liabilities, respectively. Given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans, variations in any of the preceding factors could cause significant fluctuation in our earnings as well as our equity from year to year and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans, particularly in the U.K.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients

'

businesses and levels of business activity.

Global economic and political conditions affect our clients

'

businesses and the markets they serve. These economic conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Should it become necessary for us to restructure our business, including reducing our work force, as a result of market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services, our ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected.


Financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations and investing activities (including the financing of any future acquisitions).

Our cash investments, including those held in a fiduciary capacity, are subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the difficulties faced by financial institution counterparties. If the banking system or the fixed income, credit or equity markets deteriorate, the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected.

Our significant non-U.S. operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business.

We are subject to exchange rate risk because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies, and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Our U.S. operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in U.S. dollars. In certain jurisdictions, however, our Risk and Insurance Services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies, but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency. Due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations. Exchange rate risk could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

Increased counterparty risk and changes in interest rates could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial results.

During times of stress in the banking industry, counterparty risk can quickly escalate, potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors. In addition, we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments, and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels.

We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.

The Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses. In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to the Company, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock.

Further, the Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. Since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the U.S., it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries outside the U.S.

Funds from the Company's operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. are regularly repatriated to the U.S. via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings. A number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive, including, but not limited to, foreign exchange rates and tax-related costs.

In the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate.

Credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk.

Currently, the Company's senior debt is rated Baa2 by Moody's and A- by S&P.  The rating from S&P carries a Stable outlook, while the rating from Moody

’

s carries a Positive outlook.

If we need to raise capital in the future (for example, in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives), credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs, and could limit our access to financing sources. Further, we believe that a downgrade to a rating below investment-


grade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures.

Our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly.

Quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors. These include:

•

the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter;

•

the possibility that clients may decide to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress;

•

fluctuations in hiring and utilization rates and clients

'

ability to terminate engagements without penalty;

•

seasonality due to the impact of regulatory deadlines, policy renewals and other timing factors to which our clients are subject;

•

the success of our acquisitions or investments;

•

macroeconomic factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and global securities markets, particularly in the case of Mercer, where fees in certain business lines are derived from the value of assets under management or administration; and

•

general economic conditions, since results of operations are directly affected by the levels of business activity of our clients, which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve.

A significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term. Therefore, a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses.

If we are unable to collect our receivables, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for our work performed. Accounts receivable typically total about one-quarter of our total annual revenues. In most cases, we bill and collect on relatively short cycles. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could result in financial difficulties for our clients, which could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. Timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of, or be unable to collect, our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience an increase in the time it takes to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.

Concerns regarding the European debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the Euro could adversely affect the Company's operating results as well as the value of the Company's Euro-denominated assets.

Concerns persist regarding the ability of certain Eurozone countries to service their debt obligations.  As a result, a number of these countries have undertaken a variety of actions, such as cutting spending and raising taxes, designed to ease their future debt burdens. A potential consequence may be stagnant growth, or even recession, in the Eurozone economies and beyond. Any of these developments could lead to further contraction in the Eurozone economies, adversely affecting our operating results in the region. The Company may also face increased

credit risk as our clients and financial institution counterparties in the region find themselves with reduced resources to meet their obligations. Finally, the value of the Company's assets held in the Eurozone, including cash holdings, will decline if the currency devalues.


Global Operations

We are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations.

We do business worldwide. In 2013, 55% of the Company

'

s total revenue was generated from operations outside the United States, and over one-half of our employees are located outside the United States. We expect to expand our non-U.S. operations further.

The geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks. These include, among others, risks relating to:

•

economic and political conditions in foreign countries;

•

unexpected increases in taxes or changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws;

•

withholding or other taxes that foreign governments may impose on the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries;

•

potential transfer pricing-related tax exposures that may result from the allocation of U.S.-based costs that benefit our non-U.S. businesses;

•

potential conflicts of interest that may arise as we expand the scope of our businesses and our client base;

•

international hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters and infrastructure disruptions;

•

local investment or other financial restrictions that foreign governments may impose;

•

potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government agencies, some of which may conflict with U.S. or other sources of law;

•

potential costs and difficulties in complying, or monitoring compliance, with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad, including trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, as well as import and export restrictions;

•

limitations or restrictions that foreign or U.S. legislative bodies or regulators may impose on the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services;

•

limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries;

•

the length of payment cycles and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, particularly in light of the increasing number of insolvencies in the current economic environment and the numerous bankruptcy laws to which they are subject;

•

engaging and relying on third parties to perform services on behalf of the Company; and

•

potential difficulties in monitoring employees in geographically dispersed locations.

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an event, our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems would provide us with an important advantage. Nevertheless, we could still experience near-term operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel.

Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario.


We regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.

Competitive Risks

Each of the Company

'

s businesses operates in a highly competitive environment. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and results of operations will suffer.

As a global professional services firm, the Company faces acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors, including our geographic reach, the sophistication and quality of our services, our pricing relative to competitors and our customers

'

option to self-insure or utilize internal resources instead of consultants. If we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face, our business, results of operations and financial condition will suffer.

In addition, given the global breadth of the Company

'

s operations, the Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the United States.  Funds from the Company

'

s operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings to pay dividends to stockholders, fund share repurchases and for other corporate purposes. The Company

'

s consolidated tax rate is higher than a number of its key competitors that are domiciled outside the United States where corporate tax rates are lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The consolidated tax rate at which our earnings are taxed could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete with a number of our peers.

In our Risk and Insurance Services segment, in addition to the challenges posed by capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance, we compete intensely against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a global, regional, national or local scale for both client business and employee talent. We compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries, and with various other companies that provide risk-related services. This competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a

“

syndicated

”

or

“

distributed

”

approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services, whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client

'

s account.

In our Consulting segment, we compete for business and employee talent with numerous consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms around the world. Through these affiliations, such competitors may be able to offer more comprehensive coverage to potential clients.

The loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business.

Across all of our businesses, our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining the client relationships on which our revenues depend. It is therefore very important for us to retain significant revenue-producing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them. We face numerous challenges in this regard, including the intense competition for talent in all of our businesses and the general mobility of professionals in our businesses.

Losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company, some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services.


Our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes or to successfully implement strategic initiatives could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

To remain competitive in many of our business areas, we must identify the most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings. We also have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our growth strategy.  In addition to new platforms and systems, we are deploying new processes and many of our colleagues across the business are changing the way they perform certain roles to capture efficiencies. If we do not keep up with technological changes or execute well on our strategic initiatives, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Consolidation in the industries we serve could adversely affect our business.

Companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If two or more of our current clients merge

or consolidate and combine their operations, it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients. If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work. Any of these or similar possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business. Guy Carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

We face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses.

We have a history of making acquisitions, including a total of 49 acquisitions in the period 2009-2013 for aggregate purchase consideration of $1.9 billion. We have also exited various businesses, including the  sale of Kroll in 2010. We expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy. Our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue.

While we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations. Acquisitions involve special risks, including accounting, regulatory, compliance, information technology or human resources issues that could arise in connection with, or as a result of, the acquisition of the acquired company; the assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies; difficulties in integrating acquired businesses; and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect. In addition, if in the future, the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions, or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change, the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts. As of December

31, 2013, the Company

'

s consolidated balance sheet reflected $7.4 billion of goodwill and intangible assets, representing approximately 44% of the Company

'

s total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows: Risk and Insurance Services, $5.1 billion and Consulting, $2.3 billion. Given the significant size of the Company

'

s goodwill and intangible assets, an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period.

When we dispose of businesses, we are subject to the risk, contractually agreed or otherwise, of post-transaction liabilities. For example, as described in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item

8 of this report, we have retained certain contingent litigation liabilities relating to Kroll.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR RISK AND INSURANCE SERVICES SEGMENT

Our Risk and Insurance Services segment, conducted through Marsh and Guy Carpenter, represented 54% of the Company

'

s total revenue in 2013. Our business in this segment is subject to particular risks.


Results in our Risk and Insurance Services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity.

Demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows. This dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by Marsh and Guy Carpenter. To the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions, they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage, as applicable, which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue, the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets, property values, sales or number of employees, which may reduce our commission revenue, and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services, which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue. Moreover, insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Guy Carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place.

Volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability.

A significant portion of our Risk and Insurance Services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. Our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.

In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs. This trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to

“

self-insure,

”

the use of so-called

“

captive

”

insurers, and the advent of capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs. Further, the profitability of our Risk and Insurances Services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated, not only for insurance and reinsurance transactions, but also for the increasing analytical services and advice that we provide. If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services, our margins and profitability could suffer.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR CONSULTING SEGMENT

Our Consulting segment, conducted through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, represented 46% of our total revenue in 2013. Our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks.

Demand for our services might decrease for various reasons, including a general economic downturn, a decline in a client

'

s or an industry

'

s financial condition, or changes in government regulation.

Global economic conditions over the past several years have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions. Many of our clients, including financial institutions, corporations, governmental entities and pension plans, have been reducing expenses, including amounts spent on consulting services. The evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients may challenge our ability to increase revenues and profitability and may reduce demand for our services. If the economy or markets in which we operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, demand for many of Mercer

'

s benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules, which drive our clients

'

needs for benefits-related services. For example, significant changes in government regulations affecting the value, use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans, defined contribution plans, or defined benefit plans, may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of Mercer

'

s services.


Factors impacting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect Mercer.

Mercer currently provides corporate, multi-employer and public clients with actuarial, consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans. The nature of our work is complex.  Our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events, including interest rates used to discount future liabilities, estimated rates of return for a plan's assets, healthcare cost trends, salary projections and participants' life expectancies. Our consulting services involve the drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other complex documentation governing pension plans. Our administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures.  Clients dissatisfied with our services have brought, and may bring, significant claims against us, particularly in the

U.S. and the U.K. In addition, a number of Mercer's clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for Mercer's retirement business. These developments could adversely affect Mercer's business and operating results.

Our profitability may suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants.

The profitability of our Consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates (i.e., the percentage of our consultants

'

working hours devoted to billable activities). Our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors, including:

•

our ability to transition consultants promptly from completed projects to new assignments, and to engage newly-hired consultants quickly in revenue-generating activities;

•

our ability to continually secure new business engagements, particularly because a portion of our work is project-based rather than recurring in nature;

•

our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and workforces;

•

our ability to manage attrition;

•

unanticipated changes in the scope of client engagements;

•

the potential for conflicts of interest that might require us to decline client engagements that we otherwise would have accepted;

•

our need to devote time and resources to sales, training, professional development and other non-billable activities;

•

the potential disruptive impact of acquisitions and dispositions; and

•

general economic conditions.

If the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines, our profit margin and profitability could suffer.

In addition, the profitability of our Consulting businesses depends in part on the prices we are able to charge for our services. The prices we charge are affected by a number of factors, including:

•

clients

'

perception of our ability to add value through our services;

•

market demand for the services we provide;

•

our ability to develop new services and the introduction of new services by competitors;

•

the pricing policies of our competitors;

•

the extent to which our clients develop in-house or other capabilities to perform the services that they might otherwise purchase from us; and

•

general economic conditions.

If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services, our profit margin and profitability could suffer.

Item 2.      Properties.

Marsh & McLennan Companies and its subsidiaries maintain their corporate headquarters in and around New York City. We also maintain other offices around the world, primarily in leased space. In certain circumstances we may have space that we sublet to third parties, depending upon our needs in particular locations.

Marsh & McLennan Companies and certain of its subsidiaries own, directly and indirectly through special purpose subsidiaries, a 58% condominium interest covering approximately 900,000 square feet in a 44-story building in New York City. This real estate serves as the Company's headquarters and is occupied primarily by the Company and its affiliates for general corporate use. The remaining 42% condominium interest in this property is owned by an unaffiliated third party. The Company’s owned interest is financed by a 30-year loan that is non-recourse to the Company (except in the event of certain prohibited actions) and secured by a first mortgage lien on the condominium interest and a first priority assignment of leases and rents. In the event (1) the Company is downgraded below B/B2 (Stable) by any of S&P, Fitch and Moody’s or (2) an event of default under the loan has occurred and is continuing, the Company would be obligated to pre-fund certain reserve accounts relating to the mortgaged property, including a rent reserve account in an amount equal to three months’ rent for the entire occupancy of the mortgaged property.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

General

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a global professional services firm providing advice and solutions principally in the areas of risk, strategy and human capital. It is the parent company of a number of the world’s leading risk experts and specialty consultants, including: Marsh, the insurance broker, intermediary and risk advisor; Guy Carpenter, the risk and reinsurance specialist; Mercer, the provider of HR and related financial advice and services; and Oliver Wyman Group, the management, economic and brand consultancy. With approximately 55,000 employees worldwide and annual revenue of over $12 billion, the Company provides analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in more than 130 countries.

The Company conducts business through two segments:

•

Risk and Insurance Services

includes risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions) as well as insurance and reinsurance broking and services. We conduct business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter.

•

Consulting

includes Health, Retirement, Talent and Investments consulting and services and products, and specialized management and economic consulting services. We conduct business in this segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group.

We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of segment financial results. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8 in this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements.

This Management's Discussion & Analysis ("MD&A") contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the outset of this report.


Consolidated Results of Operations

Consolidated operating income increased 14% to $2.1 billion in 2013 compared with $1.8 billion in 2012   driven by a 3% increase in revenue on both a reported and underlying basis, with growth in each operating company. Expenses increased 1% on both a reported and underlying basis as the Company continues its efforts to manage expenses and improve operating efficiency.

Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $87 million or 7% in 2013 compared with 2012. Revenue increased 4%, or 3% on an underlying basis, to $6.6 billion in 2013 reflecting underlying revenue growth of 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter.

Consulting operating income increased $153 million or 22% to $845 million in 2013 compared with 2012 due to the combined effects of increased revenue at Mercer and lower expenses in the segment.

Consolidated operating income in 2012 was $1.8 billion compared with $1.6 billion in 2011.

Risk and Insurance Services operating income in 2012 increased $134 million or 11% to $1.3 billion compared with 2011, resulting from revenue growth at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter.

Consulting operating income in 2012 increased $75 million or 12% to $692 million compared with 2011, primarily due to increased revenue at Mercer and improved operating efficiency.

Discontinued operations in 2011 includes a net credit resulting from the resolution of certain legal matters and related insurance recoveries as well as the settlement of certain tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain indemnified matters in connection with the disposals of Putnam and Kroll.  These credits are partly offset by the write-off, net of tax, of capitalized software related to the  disposal of the Marsh Business Processing Outsourcing ("BPO") business.

Consolidated net income attributable to the Company was $1.4 billion in 2013, compared with $1.2 billion in 2012 and $993 million in 2011.

Consolidated Revenue and Expense

The Company conducts business in many countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of


acquisitions and dispositions may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, on the Company’s operating revenues is as follows:

*

Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.

The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above:


The following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above:


Revenue

Consolidated revenue for 2013 increased 3% on both a reported and underlying basis to $12.3 billion compared with $11.9 billion in 2012. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4% in 2013 compared with 2012, or 3% on an underlying basis, with underlying revenue growth of 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter.  The Consulting segment's revenue increased 2% on both a reported and underlying basis.  On an underlying basis, Mercer's revenue was up 4% in 2013 compared with 2012, while the Oliver Wyman Group decreased 1%.

Consolidated revenue for 2012 increased 3% to $11.9 billion compared with $11.5 billion in 2011, reflecting a 4% increase in underlying revenue, a 1% increase due to acquisitions and a 2% negative impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4% in 2012 compared with 2011 or 5% on an underlying basis, reflecting increases of 5% in Marsh and 6% in Guy Carpenter.  Consulting segment revenue increased 2%, resulting from a 4% increase in Mercer partly offset by a 1% decrease in the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, Consulting segment revenue increased 4%, reflecting a 4% increase in Mercer and a 3% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group.

Operating Expense

Consolidated operating expenses increased 1% in 2013 compared with the same period in 2012 on both a reported and underlying basis. The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher incentive compensation and pension costs, partly offset by lower costs related to professional indemnity claims.

Consolidated operating expenses increased 2% in 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. The increase reflects a 3% increase in underlying expenses, a 1% increase due to the impact of acquisitions, offset by a 2% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency exchange translation.  The increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher incentive compensation and benefits costs as well as restructuring costs at Mercer, which include exit costs related to a portion of Mercer's Canadian outsourcing business.  These increases were partly offset by credits related to the adjustment of acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities.

Restructuring

In 2013, the Company implemented restructuring actions which resulted in costs totaling $22 million.  The restructuring costs consist primarily of severance and benefits, costs for future rent and other real estate costs. These costs were incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance Services—$7 million; Consulting—$2 million; and Corporate—$13 million.

Businesses Exited

In the fourth quarter of 2011, management initiated a plan to sell the Marsh BPO business, which was completed in August 2012.  Marsh's BPO business was previously part of the Marsh U.S. Consumer business and provided policy, claims, call center and accounting operations on an outsourced basis to life insurance carriers.  Marsh invested in a technology platform that was designed to make the BPO business scalable and more efficient.  During 2011, Marsh decided that it would cease investing in the technology platform and instead exit the business via a sale.  The Company wrote off capitalized software of the BPO business of $17 million, net of tax, which is included in discontinued operations in 2011.

Risk and Insurance Services

In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.

Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of


the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required, and service provided by the Company and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients.

Marsh also receives compensation from insurance companies.  This compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions in parts of its operations. Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the revenue by segments charts earlier in this MD&A.

The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below:

Revenue

Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 4%, or 3% on an underlying basis, in 2013 compared with 2012.

In Marsh, revenue grew to $5.4 billion in 2013, an increase of 4% from the prior year, reflecting 3% growth in underlying revenue and a 2% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a 1% decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase of 3% reflects growth in all major geographies which was driven by increased new business.  International operations had underlying revenue growth of 4% reflecting increases of 13% in Latin America, 5% in Asia Pacific and 3% in EMEA, while U.S. / Canada increased 2%.

Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 5% to $1.1 billion in 2013 compared with 2012, or 5% on an underlying basis, reflecting growth across North America, International, Global Specialites and U.K. Facultative.

In July 2013, Guy Carpenter acquired Smith Group, a specialist disability reinsurance risk manager and consultant based in Maine.

Fiduciary interest income was $27 million in 2013 compared to $39 million in 2012 due to lower average invested funds combined with lower interest rates.

Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services increased 4% in 2012 compared with 2011, reflecting a 5% increase on an underlying basis and a 2% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a 2% decrease from the impact of foreign currency exchange translation.

In Marsh, revenue in 2012 was $5.2 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year, reflecting 5% growth in underlying revenue and a 2% increase from acquisitions, partly offset by a 2% decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation. The underlying revenue increase of 5% reflects growth in all major geographies, driven by new business. Underlying revenue increased 13% in Latin America, 7% in Asia Pacific, 3% in U.S. / Canada and 5% in EMEA.

Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 4% to $1.1 billion in 2012 compared with 2011, or 6% on an underlying basis, driven by Guy Carpenter's International operations, particularly Global Specialties, Asia Pacific, EMEA, Latin America, and Global Facultative.


Fiduciary interest income was $39 million in 2012 compared to $47 million in 2011 due to slightly lower average invested funds combined with lower interest rates.

Expense

Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 3% on both a reported and underlying basis in 2013 compared with 2012.  The increase in expenses on an underlying basis is primarily due to higher base salaries, pension costs and adjustments to acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities, partly offset by lower costs related to professional indemnity claims.

Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 3% in 2012 compared with 2011, reflecting a 2% increase from acquisitions and a 2% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Expenses on an underlying basis increased 3% primarily due to higher base salaries, incentive compensation and benefits costs partly offset by credits related to adjustments to acquisition- related contingent consideration liabilities.

Consulting

The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, retirement, talent and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management, economic and brand consulting services.

The major component of revenue in the Consulting segment business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s delegated investment management business and certain of Mercer’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management and/or administration.

Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance.

Reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue and sub-advisory fees related to investment management are included in revenue and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses.

The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below:

Revenue

Consulting revenue in 2013 increased 2% compared with 2012 on both a reported and underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $4.2 billion in 2013, an increase of 2% reflecting a 4% increase in underlying revenue, partly offset by a 1% decrease due to the impact of foreign currency. The underlying revenue growth was primarily driven by Health and Investments, which increased 6% and 9%, respectively.  Oliver Wyman’s revenue was flat in 2013 compared to 2012, as a 1% decrease in underlying revenue was offset by a 1% increase due to the impact of foreign currency.


The Consulting segment completed

two

acquisitions during


.

•

July -  Oliver Wyman acquired Corven, a U.K.-based management consultancy firm.

•

August - Mercer acquired Global Remuneration Solutions, a market leading compensation consulting firm based in South Africa.

Consulting revenue in 2012 increased 2% compared with 2011, or 4% on an underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $4.1 billion in 2012, an increase of 4% on both a reported and underlying basis compared with 2011, with growth in each of its businesses. The underlying revenue growth was primarily driven by 7% increases in both health and investments.  Oliver Wyman’s revenue decreased 1% in 2012 compared to 2011, but increased 3% on an underlying basis.

During


, Mercer completed the following

three

acquisitions:

•

February -  Mercer acquired the remaining

49%

of Yokogawa-ORC, a global mobility firm based in Japan, which was previously accounted for under the equity method, and Pensjon & Finans, a leading Norway-based financial investment and pension consulting firm.

•

March - Mercer acquired REPCA, a France-based broking and advisory firm for employer health and benefits plans.

Expense

Consulting expenses in 2013 decreased 1% on both a reported and underlying basis compared to 2012. This decrease reflects the impact of lower restructuring costs and continued strong expense control.

Consulting expenses in 2012 increased 1%, or 2% on an underlying basis.  This increase reflects the impact of higher benefits and restructuring costs, including charges of $16 million for the exit activities related to a portion of Mercer's Canadian outsourcing business.

Corporate and Other

The following results of Corporate and Other includes the run-off of Corporate Advisory and Restructuring Group ("CARG") operations:

Corporate expenses in 2013 were $190 million compared to $203 million in 2012.  The decrease is primarily due to lower amortization of equity awards and lower severance, partially offset by higher pension expense.

Corporate expenses in 2012 were $203 million compared to $188 million in 2011.  The increase was primarily due to accelerated amortization of equity awards for retirement eligible senior executives and higher consulting costs associated with corporate initiatives.

The CARG amounts reflect payments received related to the CARG businesses divested in 2008.

Discontinued Operations

As part of the disposal transactions for Putnam and Kroll, the Company provided certain indemnities, primarily related to pre-transaction tax uncertainties and legal contingencies. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, liabilities were established related to these indemnities at the time of the sales and reflected as a reduction of the gain on disposal. Discontinued operations includes charges or credits resulting from the settlement or resolution of the indemnified matters, as well as adjustments to the liabilities related to such matters. Discontinued operations in 2013 includes estimated costs covered under the indemnity related to the Kroll sale as well as tax indemnities related to the Putnam sale.  Discontinued operations in 2011 includes credits of

$50 million

from the resolution of certain legal matters


and insurance recoveries, as well as the settlement of tax audits and the expiration of the statutes of limitations related to certain of the indemnified matters, primarily with respect to Putnam.

In the fourth quarter of


, management initiated a plan to sell the Marsh BPO business which was completed in August 2012. Marsh's BPO business, previously part of Marsh U.S. Consumer business, provided policy, claims, call center and accounting operations on an outsourced basis to life insurance carriers.  Marsh invested in a technology platform that was designed to make the BPO business scalable and more efficient.  During


, Marsh decided that it would cease investing in the technology platform and instead exit the business via a sale.  The Company wrote off capitalized software of the BPO business of

$17 million

, net of tax, which is included in discontinued operations in 2011.

Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations is as follows:

Other Corporate Items

Interest

Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $18 million in 2013 compared with $24 million in 2012.  The decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates compared with the prior year.  Interest expense was $167 million in 2013 compared with $181 million in 2012.  The decrease is due to lower average debt balances in 2013 and lower interest rates on senior notes issued in 2013 compared with the interest rates on senior notes that matured or were extinguished during 2013.

Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $24 million in 2012 compared with $28 million in 2011.  The decrease in interest income was due to lower average interest rates compared with the prior year.  Interest expense was $181 million in 2012 compared with $199 million in 2011.  The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on senior notes issued during the second half of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, compared with the interest rate on notes that matured.

Cost of Extinguishment of Debt

On October 24, 2013, the Company purchased $250 million of its 2015 Notes.  The Company acquired the Notes at market value plus a make whole premium based on the terms of the original indenture, which exceeded its carrying value and resulted in a cost of approximately $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.

On July 15, 2011, the Company purchased $600 million of outstanding notes, comprising $330 million of its 2014 Notes and $270 million of its 2015 Notes.  The Company acquired the Notes at market value plus a tender premium, which exceeded the carrying value and resulted in a charge of approximately $72 million in the third quarter of 2011.

Investment Income (Loss)

The caption “Investment income” in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in current earnings. It includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of debt and available for sale securities and the change in value of the Company's holdings in certain private equity funds, including equity method gains


(losses) on its investment in the Trident funds. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance or consulting companies and investments in private equity funds. The Company recorded gains on its investment in Trident II of $22 million and $35 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, including $15 million of deferred performance fees recognized in the first quarter of 2013. Trident II has now fully harvested all its portfolio investments and made final distributions to its partners during the fourth quarter of 2013.  The Company has now recognized all of the performance fees related to its general partnership interest in Trident II. Investment income for 2013 includes performance fees of $40 million related to the Company's general partnership interest in Trident III which had been deferred, but are no longer subject to claw back. Trident III is a private equity fund created in 2003. Prior to 2013, no Trident III-related investment income had been recognized since 2006, when MMC contributed its limited partnership investment interest to its U.K. pension plan. At December 31, 2013, the Company had deferred performance fees of

approximately

$38 million related to Trident III. Recognition of these deferred performance fees will only occur as investments are harvested and the performance fees are no longer subject to claw back. Timing of this is unknown and is not controlled by the Company.

In 2012, investment income was $24 million compared with $9 million in 2011.  This increase was primarily due to higher mark-to-market gains on private equity fund investments, partly offset by an impairment loss on a debt security of $8 million.

Income Taxes

The Company's consolidated effective tax rate was 30.1%, 29.0% and 30.1% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate.

The lower effective tax rate attributed to the Company's foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the U.S., net of the U.S. tax impact from repatriating foreign earnings.  In 2013, pre-tax income in the U.K., Canada, Australia, France and Bermuda accounted for approximately 60% of the Company's total non-U.S. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 21% (excluding the non-cash deferred tax impact of U.K. tax legislation enacted in 2013), 27%, 31%, 42% and 0%, respectively.  Under current U.S. tax law, the Company anticipates its non-U.S. operations will continue to incur taxes at rates below the U.S. federal tax rate of 35%.

The Company's U.S. revenue over the past three years has been approximately 45% of total revenue, while over that period the pre-tax income from U.S. locations varied from 9% to 21% of total pre-tax income.

As a U.S. domiciled parent holding company, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is the issuer of essentially all of the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S.  Further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the United States.

The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future. It is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower tax rates. A proportional increase in U.S. pre-tax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because U.S. federal and state corporate tax rates exceed tax rates applicable outside the U.S.  Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation.

The realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. The Company and Marsh have been profitable in the U.S. and globally. Tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings.  The Company assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets, particularly state deferred tax assets of Marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns, state deferred tax assets of all of the Company's domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the Company files a unitary or combined state tax return, and foreign tax credit carry-forwards in the Company's consolidated U.S. federal tax return. When making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013,


the Company considered all available evidence, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. The evidence considered included (i) the profitability of the Company's U.S. operations throughout the period 2011 to 2013, (ii) the nature, frequency, and severity of losses incurred before 2011, (iii) profit trends evidenced by continued improvements in the Company's and Marsh's operating performance, (iv) the non-recurring nature of some of the items that contributed to losses before 2011, (v) the carry-forward periods for the net operating losses ("NOLs") and foreign tax credit carry-forwards, (vi) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified, and (vii) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate utilization of NOLs.  Based on its assessment, the Company concluded that most of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. In the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods, additional valuation allowances of up to approximately $195 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets. The realization of the remaining U.S. federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to U.S. profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future annual earnings from the Company's profitable global operations, consistent with the Company's historical practice. In addition, when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013, the Company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses, including other U.S. entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries, and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders, for share repurchases and for corporate expenses. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.

The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States. Funds from the Company’s operating subsidiaries located outside of the United States are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings. At December 31, 2013, the Company had approximately $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, substantially all of which is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs. At the current time, the Company does not intend to repatriate any of this cash.  The non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents considered permanently reinvested includes approximately $190 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds out of current annual earnings.  While management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested, if facts or circumstances change, management could elect to repatriate them, if necessary, which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future.

Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.

Operating Cash Flows

The Company generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations in both 2013 and 2012. These amounts reflect the net income reported by the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, cost of extinguishment of debt and the disposition of businesses, adjusted for non-cash


charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets.

Pension Related Items

During 2013, the Company contributed $26 million to its U.S. pension plans and $620 million to non-U.S. pension plans, which included contributions of $250 million to pre-fund all of the 2014 and a substantial portion of the 2015 deficit funding contributions for the U.K. plans and a discretionary contribution of $70 million to the Canadian plans. In 2012, the Company contributed $124 million to U.S. plans and $389 million to non-U.S. plans, which included $100 million of discretionary contributions to each of the U.S. and the U.K. plans.

In the U.S., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined under the ERISA guidelines.  The pension stabilization provisions included in the "Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act", enacted on July 6, 2012, changed the methodology for determining the discount rate used for calculating plan liabilities under ERISA, which determines, in part, the funding requirements.    After considering the impact of the pension funding stabilization provisions discussed above, the Company expects less than $1 million of contributions will be required for its U.S. tax-qualified plan through the end of 2014. The Company also expects to fund approximately $24 million to its non-qualified U.S. pension plans in 2014.

The Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 82% of non-U.S. plan assets. Contribution rates for non-US plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP.   In the U.K., contributions to defined benefit pension plans are determined through a negotiation process between the Company and the plans' Trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. This process is governed by U.K. pension regulations. The assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for U.S. GAAP and currently result in a lower funded status than under U.S. GAAP. The current funding plan was based on assumptions (including interest rates, inflation, salary increases and mortality) that reflected market conditions as of year-end 2009, was agreed to in early 2011 and formed the basis for the Company's aggregate contributions to the U.K. plans for 2011 through 2013. In 2013, the Company made required contributions of $300 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, including amounts called for under the U.K. funding plan. Additionally, the Company made a $250 million  contribution to pre-fund certain deficit funding contributions for the U.K. plans, described above, and a $70 million discretionary contribution to its Canadian plans. The valuation of the U.K. pension plan at December 31, 2012 that results from the negotiation process described above will determine funding that is expected to become applicable in 2014.  Contributions to the U.K. plans typically comprised of a portion related to the current service cost, that is, the benefits earned by employees in the current year, plus an amount intended to reduce, over time, any deficit determined through the Company's negotiations with the Trustee.  In the aggregate, the Company expects to fund approximately $160 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2014, comprising approximately $90 million to plans outside of the U.K. and $70 million to the U.K. plans.

Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan.

After completion of a consultation period with affected colleagues, in January 2014, the Company amended its U.K. defined benefit pension plans, to close those plans to future benefit accruals effective August 1, 2014 and will replace those plans, along with its existing defined contribution plans, with a new, comprehensive defined contribution arrangement.  As required under GAAP, the Company re-measured the defined benefit plans’ assets and liabilities at the amendment date, based on assumptions and market conditions at that date. As a result of the re-measurement, the Projected Benefit Obligation ("PBO") increased by approximately $147 million and the funded status decreased by approximately $137 million. The change in the PBO and in the funded status relates primarily to a decrease in the discount rate at the re-measurement date. The net periodic benefit costs recognized in 2014 will be the weighted average resulting from the December 31, 2013 measurement and the January 2014 re-measurement. The Company will recognize a curtailment gain of $63 million in the first quarter of 2014, primarily resulting


from the recognition of the remaining prior service credit related to a plan amendment made in December 2012. This gain will be mostly offset by a transition benefit to certain employees most impacted by the amendment. As a result of the amendments to the U.K. plans, the Company expects an increase in contributions to its defined contribution plans of approximately $30 million related to the transfer of colleagues from defined benefit to defined contribution plans, and funding of a portion of the transition benefit.

The year-over-year change in the funded status of the Company's pension plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $1.0 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2013 for the U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans, respectively, compared with $1.9 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2012. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of increases in the discount rates, actual returns on plan assets in 2013 that were higher than the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and discretionary contributions to the plans, discussed above.  In the past several years, the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates.  The discount rate used to measure plan liabilities increased in both the U.S. and the U.K. (the Company's two largest plans) in 2013 after decreasing in each of the four years from 2009 to 2012. At the end of 2009, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 6.0%, declining to 5.6%, 4.9% and 4.4% at the end of 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.  In 2013 the weighted average discount rate increased to 4.8%. An increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan liability, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan liability, resulting in actuarial losses. During 2013, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 12.6% and 8.6% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively.  During 2012, the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 14.1%, and 9.8% in the U.S. and U.K., respectively; and in 2011, the actual returns were 5.8% in the U.S. and 4.8% in the U.K.   In 2012 and 2010, actuarial losses resulting from declines in the discount rate were partly offset by actual asset returns which exceeded the assumed rates of return in each year.  In 2011, both the decline in the discount rate and actual asset returns that were lower than the assumed rates of return contributed to the actuarial losses.

Overall, based on the measurement at December 31, 2013, the Company’s pension expense was expected to decrease in 2014 by approximately $128 million, partly offset by compensation considerations.  Approximately 85% of this decrease relates to the U.S. plans. The decrease in the expected U.S. pension expense results primarily from an increase in the discount rates used to measure U.S. plan liabilities along with the impact of an increase in plan assets at the end of 2013 resulting from investment returns.  The remainder of the decrease relates to plans outside of the U.S. resulting from a modest increase in the discount rate and an increase in plan assets resulting from both asset performance and contributions.

As a result of the plan remeasurement to reflect the amendments to the U.K. plans, described above, an incremental decrease of approximately $31 million for defined benefit pension expense is expected for 2014, primarily resulting from the elimination of the service cost component, effective August 1, 2014.  However, the decrease in the defined benefit pension cost resulting from the amendment will be largely offset by increased cost for the new defined contribution plan which will replace the existing defined benefit plans in the U.K.

The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

Other

The Company received $322 million in cash refunds of U.S. federal income taxes during the second quarter of 2011, comprising $212 million from carrying back the net capital loss incurred in 2010 from the sale of Kroll and various other assets, and $110 million from the cash settlement of the IRS audit for the periods 2006 through 2008.  The audit settlement primarily reflected the allowance of carry back claims


for net operating losses and excess foreign tax credits arising in 2008.  The impact on the tax provision of these events was reflected in prior periods and did not impact income tax expense reported in 2011.

Financing Cash Flows

Net cash used for financing activities was $834 million in 2013 compared with $633 million of net cash used for financing activities in 2012. The Company increased outstanding debt by approximately $37 million in 2013 while outstanding debt decreased by $10 million and $100 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Debt

In September 2013, the Company issued $250 million of 2.55% five-year senior notes and $250 million of 4.05% ten-year senior notes.  The net proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, which included a partial redemption of $250 million of the outstanding principal amount of the existing 5.75% senior notes due 2015.  The redemption settled in October 2013 with a total cash outflow of approximately $275 million, including a $24 million cost for early redemption based on the terms of the original indenture.

During the first quarter of 2013, the Company used cash to repay its 4.85% fixed rate $250 million senior notes that matured.

During the first quarter of 2012, the Company repaid its 6.25% fixed rate $250 million senior notes that matured.  The Company used proceeds from the issuance of 2.3% five-year $250 million senior notes in the first quarter to repay the maturing notes.

On July 15, 2011, the Company purchased $600 million of outstanding notes comprising $330 million of its 2014 Notes and $270 million of its 2015 Notes (collectively, the "Notes").  The Company acquired the Notes at fair value plus a tender premium, which exceeded its carrying value.  A cost of approximately $72 million was recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the third quarter of 2011 related to the extinguishment of this debt.

The Company used proceeds from the issuance of 4.80% ten-year $500 million senior notes in the third quarter of 2011 and cash on hand to purchase the Notes.

Acquisitions

During 2013, the Company paid $17 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior years. These payments are split between financing and operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The portion of these payments that are reflected as a financing activity is $9 million, which represents payments related to the contingent consideration liability that was recorded on the date of acquisition. Any payments made related to increases in the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the date of acquisition are reflected as operating cash flows, which in 2013 was $8 million. Remaining estimated future contingent consideration payments of $104 million for acquisitions completed in 2013 and in prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013.

During 2012, the Company paid $30 million of contingent payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods.

In the second quarter of 2011, the Company acquired the remaining minority interest of a previously majority-owned entity for total cash consideration of $8 million.

In the first quarter of 2011, the Company paid deferred purchase consideration of $13 million related to the purchase in 2009 of the minority interest of a previously controlled entity.


Credit Facilities

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries maintain a $1.0 billion multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus an agreed fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly.  There were no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2013.

In December 2012, the Company closed on a $50 million, 3-year delayed draw term loan facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus an agreed fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings.  The facility requires the Company to maintain coverage ratios and leverage ratios consistent with the revolving credit facility discussed above.  The Company had $50 million of borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2013.

The Company’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and A- by Standard & Poor’s. The Company’s short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-2 by Standard & Poor’s. The Company carries a positive outlook from Moody’s and a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s.

The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $282 million at December 31, 2013 and $247 million at December 31, 2012. There was $1 million outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2013 and no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2012.

Share Repurchases

In May 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized share repurchases of up to $1 billion of the Company's common stock.  During 2013, the Company repurchased 13.2 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $550 million at an average price per share of $41.76.  The Company remains authorized to purchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of approximately $563 million.

There is no time limit on this authorization.  During 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $230 million at an average price per share of $33.36.

Dividends

The Company paid total dividends of $533 million in 2013 ($0.96 per share), $497 million in 2012 ($0.90 per share) and $480 million in 2011 ($0.86 per share).

Investing Cash Flows

Net cash used for investing activities amounted to $446 million in 2013 compared with $583 million used for investing activities in 2012. The Company made eight acquisitions in 2013.  Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $125 million. In addition, in 2013, the Company paid $15 million of deferred purchase consideration related to acquisitions made in prior years and $2 million for the purchase of other intangible assets.  Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $44 million for acquisitions completed in 2013 and in prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013.

The Company made 15 acquisitions in 2012.  Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $230 million. In addition, in 2012, the Company paid $59 million of deferred purchase consideration related to acquisitions made in prior years and $3 million for the purchase of other intangible assets.

The Company received proceeds from distributions on its Investment in Trident II of $100 million, $35 million and $61 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Trident II has now fully harvested all its portfolio investments and final distributions were made to partners during the fourth quarter of 2013.

The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $401 million in 2013 and $320 million in 2012, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs.

The Company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $25 million in two private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies.


Commitments and Obligations

The following sets forth the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2013:

The above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $128 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $7 million that may become payable during 2014. The above does not include the indemnified liabilities discussed in Note 15 as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities. The above does not include net pension liabilities of approximately $900 million because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets, and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. The amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from plan assets are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.  In 2014, the Company expects to contribute approximately $25 million and $160 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively.

Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Legal and Other Loss Contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions.  GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analyses to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.

In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.


Retirement Benefits

The Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.

The Company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.  The gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees, or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive, over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees.

The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, the Company expects pension expense in 2014 to decrease approximately $128 million compared with 2013, partly offset by compensation considerations.

Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which together comprise approximately 86% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows:

Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate.  Changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost.

The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes

The Company's tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent,


regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.

Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.

Tax law requires items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers tax-planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law.  The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company's recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.

Fair Value Determinations

Goodwill Impairment Testing—The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year.  In 2013, the Company elected to not use the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a step 1 impairment test was necessary and instead elected to perform a step 1 impairment test.  Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or discounted cash flow model. This fair value determination was categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level.

The Company completed its 2013 annual review in the third quarter and concluded goodwill was not impaired, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin.

Share-based Payment

The guidance for accounting for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans


and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by the accounting guidance.

As of December 31, 2013, there was $17 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.2 years. Also as of December 31, 2013, there was $74 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards.  The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately one year.

See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for share-based payments.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the Company’s financial results, if determinable, under the sub-heading "New Accounting Pronouncements".


Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk and Credit Risk

Certain of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.

Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk

The Company has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance the Company’s asset base.  In February 2011, the Company entered into two 3.5-year interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of the first $250 million of its 5.375% senior notes due in 2014. Under the terms of the swaps, the counter-parties will pay the Company a fixed rate of 5.375% and the Company will pay interest at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 3.726%. The swaps are designated as fair value hedging instruments and are deemed to be perfectly effective in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.

Interest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates.

The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates:

Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 8 basis points, over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $3 million.

In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counter-party limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.

Foreign Currency Risk

The translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 55% of total revenue. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to  mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. The Company estimates that a 10%

movement of major foreign currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) in the same direction against the U.S. dollar that held constant over the course of the year would increase or decrease full year operating income by approximately $47 million.


Equity Price Risk

The Company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies.  Publicly traded investments of $18 million are classified as available for sale. Non-publicly traded investments of $14 million are accounted for using the cost method and $89 million are accounted for using the equity method. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.

Other

A number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations:

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (the "Company”), a global professional services firm, is organized based on the different services that it offers. Under this organizational structure, the Company’s

two

business segments are Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting.

The Risk and Insurance Services segment provides risk management activities and insurance broking, reinsurance broking and insurance program management services for businesses, public entities, insurance companies, associations, professional services organizations, and private clients. The Company conducts business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter.

The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through

two

main business groups. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, retirement, talent and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services.

Acquisitions impacting the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments are discussed in Note 4 below.

Principles of Consolidation:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities:

In its capacity as an insurance broker or agent, the Company generally collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. The Company also collects claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims proceeds are held by the Company in a fiduciary capacity. Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes interest on fiduciary funds of $

27 million

, $

39 million

and $

47 million

in


,


and


, respectively. The Consulting segment recorded fiduciary interest income of $

5 million

in


and

$4 million

in both


and


. Since fiduciary assets are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities.

Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables amounted to

$8.2 billion

and $

9.1 billion

at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively. The Company is not a principal to the contracts under which the right to receive premiums or the right to receive reimbursement of insured losses arises. Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables are, therefore, not assets and liabilities of the Company and are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. These advances are made from corporate funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as receivables.

Mercer manages approximately

$16 billion

of assets in trusts or funds for which Mercer’s management or trustee fee is considered a variable interest. Mercer is not the primary beneficiary of these trusts or funds. Mercer’s only variable interest in any of these trusts or funds is its unpaid fees, if any. Mercer’s maximum exposure to loss of its interests is, therefore, limited to collection of its fees.

Revenue:

Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services rendered and interest income on certain fiduciary funds. Insurance commissions and fees for risk transfer services generally are recorded as of the effective date of the applicable policies or, in certain cases (primarily in the Company's reinsurance broking operations), as of the effective date or billing date, whichever is later. A reserve for policy cancellation is provided based on historic and current data on cancellations. Fees for non-risk transfer services provided to clients are recognized over the period in which the services are provided, using a proportional performance model. Fees resulting from


achievement of certain performance thresholds are recorded when such levels are attained and such fees are not subject to forfeiture.

Consulting revenue includes fees paid by clients for advice and services and commissions from insurance companies for the placement of individual and group contracts. Fee revenue for engagements where remuneration is based on time plus out-of-pocket expenses is recognized based on the amount of time consulting professionals expend on the engagement. For fixed fee engagements, revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model. Revenue from insurance commissions not subject to a fee arrangement is recorded over the effective period of the applicable policies. Revenue for asset based fees is recognized on an accrual basis by applying the daily/monthly rate as contractually agreed with the client to the applicable net asset value. On a limited number of engagements, performance fees may also be earned for achieving certain prescribed performance criteria. Such fees are recognized when the performance criteria have been achieved and agreed to by the client. Reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue and sub-advisory fees related to investment management are included in revenue and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of certificates of deposit and time deposits, with original maturities of three months or less, and money market funds.  The estimated fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value.  The Company is required to maintain operating funds of approximately

$190 million

related to regulatory requirements outside the U.S. or as collateral under captive insurance arrangements.

Fixed Assets:

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

Depreciation of buildings, building improvements, furniture, and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Furniture and equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from

three

to

ten

years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods covered by the applicable leases or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is less. Buildings are depreciated over periods ranging from

thirty

to

forty

years. The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable.

The components of fixed assets are as follows:

Investments:

The Company holds investments primarily in private companies and certain private equity funds.

Certain investments, primarily investments in private equity funds, are accounted for under the equity method using a consistently applied three-month lag period adjusted for any known significant changes from the lag period to the reporting date of the Company. The underlying private equity funds follow investment company accounting, where investments within the fund are carried at fair value. The Company records in earnings, investment gains/losses for its proportionate share of the change in fair value of the funds, which amounted to gains of $

12 million

, $

33 million

and $

10 million

in


,


and


, respectively. Investments recorded using the equity method are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.


As part of the sale of MMC Capital in 2005, the Company retained the right to receive certain performance fees related to the Trident II and Trident III private equity partnerships. The Company recognizes performance fee income when such fees are no longer subject to forfeiture, which may take a number of years to resolve. The Company deferred the recognition of income related to such performance fees of $

38 million

and $

63 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively, related to Trident III. This income is based on the investment performance over the life of each investment in the private equity fund, and future declines in fund performance from current levels may result in the forfeiture of such revenue.  Trident II has now fully harvested all its portfolio investments and final distributions were made to partners during the fourth quarter of


. Therefore, the Company no longer holds an investment in Trident II.  Approximately

$40 million

and $

15 million

of performance fees were recognized in


related to Trident III and Trident II, respectively, and included as part of investment income. The Company received approximately $

100 million

in cash proceeds related to Trident II partnership distributions in


.

Gains or losses recognized in earnings from the investments, including the performance fees discussed above, are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of income.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:

Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. The Company performs an annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. When a step 1 test is performed, fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. As discussed in Note 6, the Company may elect to assess qualitative factors to determine if a step 1 assessment is necessary.  Other intangible assets, which primarily consist of customer lists, that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their estimated lives and reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature. The Company had

no

indefinite lived identified intangible assets at

December 31, 2013

or


.

Capitalized Software Costs:

The Company capitalizes certain costs to develop, purchase or modify software for the internal use of the Company. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from


to


years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to updates and enhancements are only capitalized if they will result in additional functionality. Capitalized computer software costs of $

399 million

and $

278 million

, net of accumulated amortization of $

748 million

and $

691 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively, are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Legal and Other Loss Contingencies:

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions ("E&O").  GAAP requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.

In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.

The legal and other contingent liabilities described above are not discounted.


Income Taxes:

The Company's effective tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions and the ability to realize deferred tax assets.

The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.

Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Tax law requires items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the income tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements.

Derivative Instruments:

All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

Concentrations of Credit Risk:

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, commissions and fees receivable and insurance recoverables. The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places its investments in a large number of high quality financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas.

Per Share Data:

From 2009 through 2012, the Company used the two-class method to compute basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS"). Under the accounting guidance which applies to the calculation of EPS for share-based payment awards with rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and should be included in the computation of basic and dilutive EPS using the two-class method.


In the first quarter of 2013, the share-based payment awards with non-forfeitable rights to dividends became fully vested.  As a result, the Company is no longer required to use the two-class method and in the first quarter of 2013 used the treasury stock method to calculate EPS.  There was no difference in the earnings per share calculations when comparing the two-class method to the treasury stock method for the years ended 2012 and 2011.  Therefore, the prior period information in the chart below shows the earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method, consistent with current year presentation.

Basic net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.

Diluted net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares. Reconciliations of the applicable income components used for diluted EPS - Continuing operations and basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are presented below.  The reconciling items related to the calculation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are the same for net income attributable to the Company.

There were

22.6 million

,

32.0 million

and

38.9 million

stock options outstanding as of

December 31, 2013

,


and


, respectively.

Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may vary from those estimates.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

In July 2013, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carry-forward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carry-forward.  However, to the extent a net operating loss carry-forward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carry-forward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position or the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose (provided that the tax law permits a choice), the unrecognized tax benefit shall be presented in the financial statement as a liability and shall not be combined with deferred tax assets.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013.  The adoption of this new guidance will affect balance sheet classification and footnote disclosure only and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

In June 2013, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which amends the criteria for an entity to qualify as an investment company.  The guidance clarifies the characteristics of an investment company, provides comprehensive guidance to determine whether an entity is an investment company and sets


measurement and disclosure requirements for investment companies.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013.  Earlier application is prohibited.  Adoption of the guidance is not expected to materially affect the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2013, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.  The Company implemented this new guidance for the reporting period ended March 31, 2013.  Other than enhanced disclosure, the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

In the first quarter of 2012, the Company adopted new accounting guidance related to the presentation of Comprehensive Income. The new guidance gives an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. The guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. The guidance did not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.  Other than enhanced disclosure, adoption of this new guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

In January 2012, the Company adopted guidance issued by the FASB on accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements.  The guidance expands the disclosures on Level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes, the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and the hierarchy classification, valuation techniques, and inputs for assets and liabilities whose fair value is only disclosed in the footnotes.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform with current year presentation, in particular with regard to the Per Share Data disclosure in Footnote 1, which is presented using the treasury stock method, since there is no difference in the earnings per share calculation between the treasury stock method and the two-class method for the three years presented.

4.     Acquisitions

The Company’s acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases. Net assets and results of operations are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements commencing at the respective purchase dates. In connection with acquisitions, the Company records the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased, which typically consist of purchased customer lists, trademarks and non-compete agreements.  The valuation of purchased intangible assets involves significant estimates and assumptions.  Any change in assumptions could affect the carrying value of such intangible assets.

Pro-Forma Information

While the Company does not believe its acquisitions are material in the aggregate, the following unaudited pro-forma financial data gives effect to the acquisitions made by the Company during


and


and for the Barney & Barney acquisition that closed in January 2014.  In accordance with accounting guidance related to pro-forma disclosures, the information presented for current year acquisitions and the Barney & Barney acquisition is as if they occurred on January 1, 2012 and reflects acquisitions made in 2012 as if they occurred on January 1, 2011. The pro-forma information adjusts for the effects of amortization of acquired intangibles. The unaudited pro-forma financial data is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been achieved if such acquisitions had occurred on the dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of future consolidated results.


The consolidated statements of income for


include approximately

$50 million

of revenue and

$9 million

of net operating income, respectively, related to acquisitions made during


.

5.     Discontinued Operations

As part of the disposal transactions for Putnam and Kroll, the Company provided certain indemnities, primarily related to pre-transaction tax uncertainties and legal contingencies. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, liabilities were established related to these indemnities at the time of the sales and reflected as a reduction of the gain on disposal. Discontinued operations includes charges or credits resulting from the settlement or resolution of the indemnified matters, as well as adjustments to the liabilities related to such matters. Discontinued operations in 2011 includes credits of

$50 million

from the resolution of certain legal matters and insurance recoveries, as well as the settlement of tax audits and the expiration of the statutes of limitations related to certain of the indemnified matters, primarily with respect to Putnam.

In the fourth quarter of


, management initiated a plan to sell the Marsh BPO business, which was completed in August 2012. Marsh's BPO business, previously part of the Marsh U.S. Consumer business, provided policy, claims, call center and accounting operations on an outsourced basis to life insurance carriers. Marsh invested in a technology platform that was designed to make the Marsh BPO business scalable and more efficient.  During


, Marsh decided that it would cease investing in the technology platform and instead exit the business via a sale.  The Company wrote off capitalized software of

$17 million

, net of tax, which is included in discontinued operations in 2011.

Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations is as follows:


6.    Goodwill and Other Intangibles

The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the

third

quarter of each year.  In 2013, the Company elected to not use the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a step 1 impairment test was necessary and instead elected to perform a step 1 impairment test.  Fair values of the reporting units were estimated using either a market approach or discounted cash flow model. This fair value determination was categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level.   The Company completed its 2013 annual review in the

third

quarter and concluded goodwill was not impaired, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin.

Other intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their estimated lives and reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature.

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:

(a)

Reflects increases due to the impact of foreign exchange in both years.


also reflects a reduction due to purchase accounting adjustments.

The goodwill acquired of $

113 million

in


(approximately $

7 million

of which is deductible for tax purposes) comprised of $

96 million

related to the Risk and Insurance Services segment and $

17 million

related to the Consulting segment.

Goodwill allocable to the Company’s reportable segments is as follows: Risk and Insurance Services,

$4.7 billion

and Consulting,

$2.2 billion

.

Amortized intangible assets consist primarily of the cost of client lists and trade names acquired. The gross cost and accumulated amortization at

December 31, 2013

and


is as follows:

The Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $

5 million

and

$8 million

in the

third

quarter of


and


, respectively, in the Risk & Insurance Services segment.


Aggregate amortization expense for each of the

years

ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


was

$72 million

,

$72 million

and

$65 million

, respectively.  The estimated future aggregate amortization expense is as follows:


7.    Income Taxes

For financial reporting purposes, income before income taxes includes the following components:

The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classifications are as follows:

(a)

Net of valuation allowances of $

12 million

in


and

$7 million

in


.

(b)

Net of valuation allowances of $

70 million

in


and $

65 million

in


.


U.S. Federal income taxes are not provided on temporary differences with respect to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration, which at

December 31, 2013

, the Company estimates, amounted to approximately $

5.2 billion

. The determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability with respect to these investments is not practicable.

A reconciliation from the U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate is shown below.

The Company’s consolidated tax rate was

30.1%

,

29.0%

and

30.1%

in


,


and


, respectively. The tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate.

Valuation allowances had net increases of $

10 million

and $

23 million

in


and


, respectively, and a decrease of

$1 million

in


. During the respective years, adjustments of the beginning of the year balances of valuation allowances decreased income tax expense by $

3 million

in


and increased income tax expense by $

16 million

in


. None of the cumulative valuation allowances relate to amounts which if realized would increase contributed capital in the future. Approximately

66%

of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards expire from


through


, and others are unlimited. The potential tax benefit from net operating loss carryforwards at the end of


comprised state and local, and non-U.S. tax benefits of $

60 million

and $

90 million

, respectively, before reduction for valuation allowances. Foreign tax credit carryforwards expire from 2019 through 2022.

The realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable.  The Company and Marsh have been profitable in the U.S. and globally.  Tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis. Certain taxing authorities allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings.  The Company assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets, particularly state deferred tax assets of Marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns, state deferred tax assets of all of the Company's domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the Company files a unitary or combined state tax return, and foreign tax credit carry-forwards in the Company's consolidated U.S. federal tax return. When making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at

December 31, 2013

, the Company considered all available evidence, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. The evidence considered included (i) the profitability of the Company's U.S. operations throughout the period 2011 to 2013, (ii) the nature, frequency, and severity of losses incurred prior to 2011, (iii) profit trends evidenced by continued improvements in the Company's and Marsh's operating performance, (iv) the non-recurring nature of some of the items that contributed to the losses before 2011, (v) the carry-forward periods for the net operating losses ("NOLs") and foreign tax credit carryforwards, (vi) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified, and (vii) tax planning strategies that would be


implemented, if necessary, to accelerate utilization of NOLs. Based on its assessment, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that most of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized.  In the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods, additional valuation allowances of up to approximately $

195 million

could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets. The realization of the remaining U.S. federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to U.S. profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future annual earnings from the Company’s profitable global operations, consistent with the Company's historical practice. In addition, when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at

December 31, 2013

, the Company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses, including other U.S. entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries, and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate.

Following is a reconciliation of the Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


:

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at

December 31, 2013

,


and 2011, $

71 million

, $

96 million

and $

102 million

, respectively, represent the amount that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in any future periods. The total gross amount of accrued interest and penalties at

December 31, 2013

,


and 2011, before any applicable federal benefit, was $

10 million

, $

13 million

and $

17 million

, respectively.

As discussed in Note 5, the Company has provided certain indemnities related to contingent tax liabilities as part of the disposals of Putnam and Kroll. At

December 31, 2013

,


and


, $

2 million

, $

6 million

and $

14 million

, respectively, included in the table above, relates to Putnam and Kroll positions included in consolidated Company tax returns. Since the Company remains primarily liable to the taxing authorities for resolution of uncertain tax positions related to consolidated returns, these balances will remain as part of the Company’s consolidated liability for uncertain tax positions. Any future charges or credits that are directly related to the disposal of Putnam and Kroll and the indemnified contingent tax issues, including interest accrued, will be recorded in discontinued operations as incurred.

The Company is routinely examined by the jurisdictions in which it has significant operations.  During 2013, the Company settled federal tax audits with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for years 2007 and 2009 through 2011.  The tax year 2008 was settled in a prior period. During 2011, the Company was accepted to participate in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) which is structured to conduct real-time compliance reviews.  The IRS is currently examining 2012 and performing a pre-filing review of the Company's 2013 U.S. operations.  New York State and New York City have examinations underway for various entities covering the years 2007 through 2011. During 2013, the State of Illinois commenced an audit of the Company for years 2009 through 2012.  During 2013, the Company filed appeals in the Massachusetts Appellate Tax Board for various entities for assessments received at the end of 2012, and the Company is currently appealing those assessments.  During 2013, the United Kingdom commenced an examination of tax years 2011 and 2012 for various subsidiaries. There are no ongoing tax audits in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Company has significant operations.  The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from examinations. The Company has established appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions in relation to the potential assessments. The Company believes the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company, although a resolution of tax matters could


have a material impact on the Company's net income or cash flows and on its effective tax rate in a particular future period.  It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease between

zero

and approximately $

21 million

within the next twelve months due to settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitation.

8.    Retirement Benefits

The Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its U.S. and non-U.S. eligible employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by U.S. law and the laws of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Company offers defined benefit plans.

Combined U.S. and non-U.S. Plans

The weighted average actuarial assumptions utilized for the U.S. and significant non-U.S. defined benefit plans and postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

The Company uses actuaries from Mercer, a subsidiary of the Company, to perform valuations of its pension plans. The long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets. The Company utilizes a model developed by the Mercer actuaries to assist in the determination of this assumption. The model takes into account several factors, including: actual and target portfolio allocation; investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust; historical portfolio performance; relevant forward-looking economic analysis; and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. These measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio. The Company generally does not adjust the rate of return assumption from year to year if, at the measurement date, it is within the best estimate range, defined as between the 25

th

and 75

th

percentile of the expected long-term annual returns in accordance with the “American Academy of Actuaries Pension Practice Council Note May 2001 Selecting and Documenting Investment Return Assumptions” and consistent with Actuarial Standards of Practice No. 27. Historical long-term average asset returns of each plan are also reviewed to determine whether they are consistent and reasonable compared with the best estimate range. The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the assumed long-term rate of return to the market-related value of plan assets. This market-related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a

five

-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a

five

-year period, the future market-related value of the assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are reflected.

The target asset allocation for the U.S. Plan is

58%

equities and equity alternatives and

42%

fixed income. At the end of


, the actual allocation for the U.S. Plan was

63%

equities and equity alternatives and

37%

fixed income. The target asset allocation for the U.K. Plans, which comprise approximately

82%

of non-U.S. Plan assets, is

50%

equities and equity alternatives and

50%

fixed income.  At the end of


, the actual allocation for the U.K. Plans was

49%

equities and equity alternatives and

51%

fixed income. The assets of the Company's defined benefit plans are diversified and are managed in accordance with applicable laws and with the goal of maximizing the plans' real return


within acceptable risk parameters.  The Company uses threshold-based portfolio rebalancing to ensure the actual portfolio remains consistent with target asset allocation ranges.

The discount rate selected for each U.S. plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are based on appropriate bond indices such as the Markit iBoxx £ Corporates AA 15+ index in the U.K. Projected compensation increases reflect current expectations as to future levels of inflation.

The components of the net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit and other postretirement plans are as follows:

Plan Assets

For the U.S. plan, investment allocation decisions are made by a fiduciary committee composed of senior executives appointed by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. For the non-U.S. plans, investment allocation decisions are made by local fiduciaries, in consultation with the Company for the larger plans. Plan assets are invested in a manner consistent with the fiduciary standards set forth in all relevant laws relating to pensions and trusts in each country. Primary investment objectives are (1) to achieve an investment return that, in combination with current and future contributions, will provide sufficient funds to pay benefits as they become due, and (2) to minimize the risk of large losses. The investment allocations are designed to meet these objectives by broadly diversifying plan assets among numerous asset classes with differing expected returns, volatilities, and correlations.

The major categories of plan assets include equity securities, equity alternative investments, and fixed income securities. For the U.S. qualified plan, the category ranges are


-

63%

for equities and equity alternatives, and


-


% for fixed income. For the U.K. Plan, the category ranges are


-


% for equities and equity alternatives, and


-


% for fixed income. Asset allocation ranges are evaluated generally every three years. Asset allocation is monitored frequently and re-balancing actions are taken as appropriate.

Plan investments are exposed to stock market, interest rate, and credit risk. Concentrations of these risks are generally limited due to diversification by investment style within each asset class, diversification by investment manager, diversification by industry sectors and issuers, and the dispersion of investments across many geographic areas.

Unrecognized Actuarial Gains/Losses

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the funded status of the Company's pension plans is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets and provides for a delayed recognition of actuarial gains or losses arising from changes in the projected benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rates, differences between the actual and expected value of plan assets and other assumption changes.  The unrecognized pension plan actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs not yet recognized in net periodic pension cost are recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI"), net of tax.  These gains and losses are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees, or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive, over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees.


U.S. Plans

The following schedules provide information concerning the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans:


Estimated amounts that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income in the next fiscal year:


The weighted average actuarial assumptions utilized in determining the above amounts for the U.S. defined benefit and other U.S. postretirement plans as of the end of the year are as follows:

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $

4.8 billion

, $

4.8 billion

and $

4.3 billion

, respectively, as of

December 31, 2013

and $

5.2 billion

, $

5.1 billion

and $

3.9 billion

, respectively, as of

December 31, 2012

.

The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets was $

4.8 billion

and $

4.3 billion

, respectively, as of

December 31, 2013

and $

5.2 billion

and $

3.9 billion

, respectively, as of

December 31, 2012

.

As of

December 31, 2013

, the U.S. qualified plan holds

5.4 million

shares of the Company’s common stock which were contributed to the Plan by the Company in 2005. This represented approximately

6%

of that plan’s assets as of

December 31, 2013

.  In addition, plan assets may be invested in funds managed by Mercer Investments, a subsidiary of the Company.

The components of the net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 became law. The net periodic benefit cost for all periods shown above includes the subsidy.

The assumed health care cost trend rate for Medicare eligibles is approximately

7.6%

in


, gradually declining to

4.5%

in 2028, and the rate for non-Medicare eligibles is

7.5%

in


, gradually declining to

4.5%

in 2028. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a small effect on the amounts reported for the U.S. health care plans because the Company caps its share of health care trend at

5%

. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Estimated Future Contributions

The Company expects to fund approximately $

24 million

for its U.S. non-qualified plans in


. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in the U.S. and applicable foreign law.  The


Company expects less than

$1 million

of contributions will be required for its U.S. tax-qualified plan through the end of 2014.

Non-U.S. Plans

The following schedules provide information concerning the Company’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and non-U.S. postretirement benefit plans:


Estimated amounts that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income in the next fiscal year:


The weighted average actuarial assumptions utilized for the non-U.S. defined and postretirement benefit plans as of the end of the year are as follows:

The non-U.S. defined benefit plans do not have any direct ownership of the Company’s common stock.

The pension plan in the United Kingdom holds a limited partnership interest in the Trident III private equity fund valued at approximately $

111 million

at

December 31, 2013

.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $

1.7 billion

, $

1.5 billion

and $

1.3 billion

, respectively, as of

December 31, 2013

and $

1.7 billion

, $

Subsequent Event

After completion of a consultation period with affected colleagues, in January


, the Company amended its U.K. defined benefit pension plans, to close those plans to future benefit accruals effective August 1,


and will replace those plans, along with its existing defined contribution plans, with a new, comprehensive defined contribution arrangement.  As required under GAAP, the Company re-measured the defined benefit plans’ assets and liabilities at the amendment date, based on assumptions and market conditions at that date. As a result of the re-measurement, the projected benefit obligation increased by approximately

$147 million

and the funded status decreased by approximately

$137 million

. The change in the PBO and in the funded status relates primarily to a decrease in the discount rate at the re-measurement date.  The net periodic benefit costs recognized in


will be the weighted average resulting from the

December 31, 2013

measurement and the January


re-measurement. The Company will recognize a curtailment gain of

$63 million

in the first quarter of


, primarily resulting from the recognition of the remaining prior service credit related to a plan amendment made in December


.This will be mostly offset by a transition benefit to certain employees most impacted by the amendment.


Components of Net Periodic Benefits Costs

The components of the net periodic benefit cost for the non-U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans and the curtailment, settlement and termination expenses are as follows:

The assumed health care cost trend rate was approximately

5.80%

in


, gradually declining to

4.85%

in 2031. Assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the non-U.S. health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Estimated Future Contributions

The Company expects to fund approximately $

160 million

to its non-U.S. pension plans in


. Funding requirements for non-U.S. plans vary by country.  Contribution rates are generally based on local funding practices and requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements under U.S. GAAP.  Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. Discretionary contributions may also be affected by alternative uses of the Company’s cash flows, including dividends, investments and share repurchases.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The Plans' estimated future benefit payments for its pension and postretirement benefits (without reduction for Medicare subsidy receipts) are as follows:


Defined Benefit Plans Fair Value Disclosures

In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance for Employers’ Disclosures About Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plan Assets. The guidance requires fair value plan asset disclosures for an employer’s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans similar to the guidance on Fair Value Measurements as well as (a) how investment allocation decisions are made, (b) the major categories of plan assets, and (c) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.

The U.S. and non-U.S. plan investments are classified into Level 1, which refers to investments valued using quoted prices from active markets for identical assets; Level 2, which refers to investments not traded on an active market but for which observable market inputs are readily available; and Level 3, which refers to investments valued based on significant unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.


The following table sets forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, a summary of the U.S. and non-U.S. plans investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at

December 31, 2013

and


.

There were

no

transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during


or


.


The tables below set forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the plans’ Level 3 assets for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and

December 31, 2012

:

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value:

Company common stock:  Valued at the closing price reported on the New York Stock Exchange.

Common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible equity securities and rights/warrants (included in Corporate stocks):  Valued at the closing price reported on the primary exchange.

Corporate bonds (included in Corporate obligations):  The fair value of corporate bonds is estimated using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable) and bond spreads. The spread data used are for the same maturity as the bond. If the spread data does not reference the issuer, then data that references a comparable issuer are used. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models.

Commercial paper (included in Corporate obligations):  The fair value of commercial paper is estimated using observable market data such as maturity date, issue date, credit rating, current commercial paper rates and settlement date.

Commercial mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities (included in Corporate obligations):  Fair value is determined using discounted cash flow models. Observable inputs are based on trade and quote activity of bonds with similar features including issuer vintage, purpose of underlying loan (first or second


lien), prepayment speeds and credit ratings. The discount rate is the combination of the appropriate rate from the benchmark yield curve and the discount margin based on quoted prices.

Common/Collective trusts:  Valued at the quoted market prices of the investments at year end.

U.S. government bonds (included in Government securities):  The fair value of U.S. government bonds is estimated by pricing models that utilize observable market data including quotes, spreads and data points for yield curves.

U.S. agency securities (included in Government securities):  U.S. agency securities are comprised of two main categories consisting of agency issued debt and mortgage pass-throughs. Agency issued debt securities are valued by benchmarking market-derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data for identical or comparable securities. Mortgage pass-throughs include certain “To-be-announced” (TBA) securities and mortgage pass-through pools. TBA securities are generally valued using quoted market prices or are benchmarked thereto. Fair value of mortgage pass-through pools are model driven with respect to spreads of the comparable TBA security.

Private equity and real estate partnerships:  Investments in private equity and real estate partnerships are valued based on the fair value reported by the manager of the corresponding partnership. The managers provide unaudited quarterly financial statements and audited annual financial statements which set forth the value of the fund.  The valuations obtained from the managers are based on various analyses on the underlying holdings in each partnership, including financial valuation models and projections, comparable valuations from the public markets, and precedent private market transactions.  Investments are valued in the accompanying financial statements based on the Plan’s beneficial interest in the underlying net assets of the partnership as determined by the partnership agreement.

Insurance group annuity contracts:  The fair values for these investments are based on the current market value of the aggregate accumulated contributions plus interest earned.

Swap assets and liabilities:  Fair values for interest rate swaps, equity index swaps and inflation swaps are estimated using a discounted cash flow pricing model. These models use observable market data such as contractual fixed rate, broker quotes, spot equity price or index value and dividend data. The fair values of credit default swaps are estimated using an income approach model which determines expected cash flows based on default probabilities from the issuer-specific credit spread curve and credit loss recovery rates, both of which are dependent on market quotes.

Real estate investment trusts:  Valued at the closing price reported on an exchange.

Short-term investment funds:  Primarily high-grade money market instruments valued at net asset value at year-end.

Real estate: Valued by investment managers generally using proprietary pricing models.

Registered investment companies:  Valued at the closing price reported on the primary exchange.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company maintains certain defined contribution plans for its employees, including the Marsh & McLennan Companies 401(k) Savings & Investment Plan (“401(k) Plan”), that are qualified under U.S. tax laws. Under these plans, eligible employees may contribute a percentage of their base salary, subject to certain limitations. For the 401(k) Plan, the Company matches a fixed portion of the employees’ contributions. The 401(k) Plan contains an Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature under U.S. tax law.  Approximately $

453 million

of the 401(k) Plan’s assets at

December 31, 2013

and $

375 million

at

December 31, 2012

were invested in the Company’s common stock. If a participant does not choose an investment direction for his or her future contributions, they are automatically invested in a BlackRock LifePath Portfolio that most closely matches the participant’s expected retirement year. The cost of these defined contribution plans related to continuing operations was $

50 million

in


, $

50 million

in


and

$48 million

in


.  In addition, the Company has a significant defined contribution plan in the U.K.  The cost of the U.K. defined contribution plan was  $

23 million

, $

21 million

and $

20 million

in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  As noted above, effective August 1, 2014, a newly formed defined contribution plan will replace the existing defined contribution and defined benefit plans with regard to future service.

Stock Benefit Plans

The Company maintains multiple stock-based payment arrangements under which employees are awarded grants of restricted stock units, stock options and other forms of stock-based payment arrangements.

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. Incentive and Stock Award Plans

On May 19, 2011, the Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. 2011 Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the “2011 Plan”) was approved by the Company's stockholders.  The 2011 Plan replaced the Company's

two

previous equity incentive plans (the 2000 Senior Executive Incentive and Stock Award Plan and the 2000 Employee Incentive and Stock Award Plan).

The types of awards permitted under the 2011 Plan include stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units payable in Company common stock or cash, and other stock-based and performance-based awards.  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) determines, at its discretion, which affiliates may participate in the 2011 Plan, which eligible employees will receive awards, the types of awards to be received, and the terms and conditions thereof.  The right of an employee to receive an award may be subject to performance conditions as specified by the Compensation Committee.  The 2011 Plan contains provisions which, in the event of a change in control of the Company, may accelerate the vesting of the awards. The 2011 Plan retains the remaining share authority of the

two

previous plans as of the date the 2011 Plan was approved by stockholders.   Awards relating to not more than approximately

23.2 million

shares of common stock, plus shares remaining unused under certain pre-existing plans, may be made over the life of the 2011 Plan.

Our current practice is to grant non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units and/or performance stock units on an annual basis to senior executives and a limited number of other employees as part of their total compensation.  We also grant restricted stock units during the year to new hires or as retention awards for certain employees.  We have not granted restricted stock since 2005.

Stock Options:

Options granted under the 2011 Plan may be designated as either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options.  The Compensation Committee determines the terms and conditions of the option, including the time or times at which an option may be exercised, the methods by which such exercise price may be paid, and the form of such payment.  Options are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  These option awards generally vest

25%

per annum and have a contractual term of

10 years

.  Certain stock options granted under the previous equity incentive plans provided for a market-based triggering event before a vested option can be exercised.  The terms and conditions of these stock option awards provided that (i) options will vest at a rate of

25%

a year beginning one year from the date of grant and (ii) each vested tranche will only become exercisable if the market price of the Company stock appreciates to a level of

15%

above the exercise price of the option and maintains that level for at least ten (10) consecutive trading days after the award has vested. The Company accounts for these awards as market-condition options.  The effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant-date fair value of such awards.  Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period and is not subsequently adjusted if the market condition is not met.  For awards without a market-based triggering event, compensation cost is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period which is normally the vesting period.

The estimated fair value of options granted without a market-based triggering event is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model. This model takes into account several factors and assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumption at the time of grant. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) is estimated using the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees' expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior.  The Company uses a blended volatility rate based on the following:  (i) volatility derived from daily closing price observations for the


-year period ended on the valuation date, (ii) implied volatility derived from traded options for the


period one week before the valuation date and (iii) average volatility for the


-year periods ended on


anniversaries prior to the valuation date, using daily closing price observations. The expected dividend yield is based on expected dividends for the expected term of the stock options.

The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model for options granted by the Company in 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:

The estimated fair value of options granted with a market-based triggering event is calculated using a binomial valuation model. The factors and assumptions used in this model are similar to those utilized in the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model except that the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve over the contractual term of the option, and the expected life is calculated by the model.  Since 2009, there have been no options granted with a market-based triggering event.  All such market-condition options have met their market price targets.

A summary of the status of the Company’s stock option awards as of

December 31, 2013

and changes during the year then ended is presented below:

In the above table, forfeited options are unvested options whose requisite service period has not been met. Expired options are vested options that were not exercised.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the Company's option awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $

6.21

, $

6.04

and $

6.67

, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $

198.1 million

, $

57.7 million

and $

23.6 million

,

respectively.

As of December 31, 2013, there was $

17 million

of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company's option awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately

1.2

years. Cash received from the exercise of stock options for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $

281.1 million

, $

179.3 million

and $

111.7 million

, respectively.

The Company's policy is to issue treasury shares upon option exercises or share unit conversion. The

Company intends to issue treasury shares as long as an adequate number of those shares is available.


Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units:

Restricted stock units may be awarded under the Company's 2011 Incentive and Stock Award Plan. The Compensation Committee determines the restrictions on such units, when the restrictions lapse, when the units vest and are paid, and under what terms the units are forfeited. The cost of these awards is amortized over the vesting period, which is generally

three years

.  Awards to senior executives and other employees may include three-year performance-based restricted stock units and three-year service-based restricted stock units. The payout of performance-based restricted stock units (payable in shares of the Company's common stock) may range, generally, from


-

200%

of the number of units granted, based on the achievement of objective, pre-determined Company or operating company performance measures, generally, over a

three

-year performance period. The Company accounts for these awards as performance condition restricted stock units. The performance condition is not considered in the determination of grant date fair value of such awards. Compensation cost is recognized over the performance period based on management's estimate of the number of units expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares paid out at the end of the

three

-year performance period. Dividend equivalents are not paid out unless and until such time that the award vests.

A summary of the status of the Company's restricted stock units and performance stock units as of December 31, 2013 and changes during the period then ended is presented below:

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the Company's restricted stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was

$31.96

and $

30.46

, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of the Company's performance stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was

$31.89

and

$30.60

, respectively.  The total fair value of the shares distributed during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 in connection with the Company's restricted stock units and performance stock units was $

205.5 million

, $

262.6 million

and $

249.0 million

, respectively.

The number of vested performance stock units includes any applicable performance adjustment shares.  The adjustment due to performance reflects the incremental portion of the above-target payout of performance stock units awarded in February 2011 and February 2012 (

190%

and

200%

, respectively) that vested during 2013 either in full or on a pro-rata basis due to certain types of termination of employment.  There is no adjustment due to performance for performance stock units awarded in February 2013 that vested during 2013 due to certain types of termination of employment within the calendar year of grant since the payout of such awards is at

100%

of target under the award's terms and conditions.

Restricted Stock:

Restricted shares of the Company's common stock may be awarded under the 2011 Plan and are subject to restrictions on transferability and other restrictions, if any, as the Compensation Committee may impose. The Compensation Committee may also determine when and under what circumstances the restrictions may lapse and whether the participant receives the rights of a stockholder, including, without limitation, the right to vote and receive dividends. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, restricted stock that is still subject to restrictions is forfeited upon termination of


employment. Shares granted, generally become unrestricted at the earlier of: (1) January 1 of the year following the vesting grant date anniversary or (2) the later of the recipient's normal or actual retirement date. For shares granted prior to 2004, the vesting grant date anniversary is

ten years

. For shares granted during 2004 and 2005, the vesting grant date anniversary is

7 years

and

5 years

, respectively. However, certain restricted shares granted in 2005 vested on the third anniversary of the grant date. There have been no restricted shares granted since 2005.

A summary of the status of the Company's restricted stock awards as of December 31, 2013 and changes during the period then ended is presented below:

The total fair value of the Company's restricted stock distributed was

$1.1 million

during the year ended December 31, 2013 and $

0.6 million

for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.

As of December 31, 2013, there was $

73.6 million

of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company's restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock unit awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately

one

year.

Marsh & McLennan Companies Stock Purchase Plans

In May 1999, the Company's stockholders approved an employee stock purchase plan (the “1999 Plan”) to replace the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “1994 Plan”), which terminated on September 30, 1999 following its fifth annual offering.  Under the current terms of the Plan, shares are purchased

four

times during the plan year at a price that is

95%

of the average market price on each quarterly purchase date. Under the 1999 Plan, after including the available remaining unused shares in the 1994 Plan and reducing the shares available by

10,000,000

consistent with the Company's Board of Directors' action in March 2007, no more than

35,600,000

shares of the Company's common stock may be sold.  Employees purchased

748,842

shares during the year ended December 31, 2013 and at December 31, 2013,

3,387,471

shares were available for issuance under the 1999 Plan. Under the 1995 Company Stock Purchase Plan for International Employees (the “International Plan”), after reflecting the additional

5,000,000

shares of common stock for issuance approved by the Company's Board of Directors in July 2002, and the addition of

4,000,000

shares due to a shareholder action in May 2007, no more than

12,000,000

shares of the Company's common stock may be sold.  Employees purchased

98,863

shares during the year ended December 31, 2013 and there were

2,987,099

shares available for issuance at December 31, 2013 under the International Plan.  The plans are considered non-compensatory.

10.     Fair Value Measurements

Fair Value Hierarchy

The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities that are valued at fair value on a recurring basis into a three-level fair value hierarchy as defined by the FASB in ASC Topic No. 820 (“Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy, for disclosure purposes, is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.


Assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value are categorized based on the inputs in the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1.

Assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market (examples include active exchange-traded equity securities and money market mutual funds).

Assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include exchange traded equity securities and mutual funds.

Level 2.

Assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following:

a)

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;

b)

Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal bonds, which trade infrequently);

c)

Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (examples include most over-the-counter derivatives, including interest rate and currency swaps); and

d)

Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full asset or liability (for example, certain mortgage loans).

Assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include corporate and municipal bonds, senior notes and interest rate swaps.

Level 3.

Assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices, or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability (examples include private equity investments, certain commercial mortgage whole loans, and long-dated or complex derivatives including certain foreign exchange options and long-dated options on gas and power).

Liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include liabilities for contingent purchase consideration.

Valuation Techniques

Equity Securities & Mutual Funds - Level 1

Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the sale price on their principal exchange, or official closing bid price for certain markets.

Other Sovereign Government Obligations, Municipal Bonds and Corporate Bonds - Level 2

The investments listed in the caption above are valued on the basis of valuations furnished by an independent pricing service approved by the trustees or dealers. Such services or dealers determine valuations for normal institutional-size trading units of such securities using methods based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships, generally recognized by institutional traders, between securities.

Interest Rate Swap Derivative - Level 2

The fair value of interest rate swap derivatives is based on the present value of future cash flows at each valuation date resulting from utilization of the swaps, using a constant discount rate of

1.6%

compared to discount rates based on projected future yield curves (See Note 12).

Senior Notes due 2014 - Level 2

The fair value of the first

$250 million

of Senior Notes maturing in 2014 is estimated to be the carrying value of those notes adjusted by the fair value of the interest rate swap derivative, discussed above. In the first quarter of 2011, the Company entered into

two

interest rate swaps to convert interest on a portion of its Senior Notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate. The swaps are designated as fair value hedging instruments. The change in the fair value of the swaps is recorded on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the debt related to these swaps is adjusted by an equal amount (See Note 12).


Contingent Purchase Consideration Liability - Level 3

Purchase consideration for some acquisitions made by the Company includes contingent consideration arrangements. Contingent consideration arrangements are primarily based on meeting EBITDA and revenue targets over periods from

two

to

four

years. The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated as the present value of future cash flows that would result from the projected revenue and earnings of the acquired entities.

The following fair value hierarchy table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2013

and


.

(a)  Included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

(b)  Included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.

(c)  Included in other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets.

(d)  Included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

(e)  Included in long term-debt in the consolidated balance sheets.

During the

year

ended

December 31, 2013

, there were

no

assets or liabilities that transferred between Level 1 and Level 2 or between Level 2 and Level 3.

The table below sets forth a summary of the changes in fair value of the Company’s Level 3 liabilities for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and

December 31, 2012

that represent contingent purchase consideration related to acquisitions:

The fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liability is based on projections of revenue and earnings for the acquired entities that are reassessed on a quarterly basis.  As set forth in the table above, based on the Company's ongoing assessment of the fair value of contingent consideration, the Company recorded a net increase in the estimated fair value of such liabilities for prior period acquisitions


of $

32 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.  A

5%

increase in the above mentioned projections would increase the liability by approximately

$8 million

.  A

5%

decrease in the above mentioned projections would decrease the liability by approximately

$9 million

.

Fair Value of Long-term Investments

The Company has certain long-term investments, primarily related to investments in non-publicly traded private equity funds of

$14 million

and

$16 million

at

December 31, 2013

and

December 31, 2012

, respectively, carried on the cost basis for which there are no readily available market prices.  The carrying values of these investments approximates fair value.  Management's estimate of the fair value of these non-publicly traded investments is based on valuation methodologies including estimates from private equity managers of the fair value of underlying investments in private equity funds. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, revenue or earnings may impact the determination of fair value.  The Company monitors these investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary. These investments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

11.    Long-term Commitments

The Company leases office facilities, equipment and automobiles under non-cancelable operating leases. These leases expire on varying dates; in some instances contain renewal and expansion options; do not restrict the payment of dividends or the incurrence of debt or additional lease obligations; and contain no significant purchase options. In addition to the base rental costs, occupancy lease agreements generally provide for rent escalations resulting from increased assessments for real estate taxes and other charges. Approximately

98%

of the Company’s lease obligations are for the use of office space.

The consolidated statements of income include net rental costs of $

403 million

, $

416 million

and $

430 million

for


,


and


, respectively, after deducting rentals from subleases ($

13 million

in


, $

10 million

in


and $

9 million

in


). These net rental costs exclude rental costs and sublease income for previously accrued restructuring charges related to vacated space.

At

December 31, 2013

, the aggregate future minimum rental commitments under all non-cancelable operating lease agreements are as follows:

The Company has entered into agreements, primarily with various service companies, to outsource certain information systems activities and responsibilities and processing activities. Under these agreements, the Company is required to pay minimum annual service charges. Additional fees may be payable depending upon the volume of transactions processed, with all future payments subject to increases for inflation. At

December 31, 2013

, the aggregate fixed future minimum commitments under these agreements are as follows:


12.    Debt

The Company’s outstanding debt is as follows:

The senior notes in the table above are publically registered by the Company with no guarantees attached.

In September 2013, the Company issued $

250 million

of

2.55%

five

-year senior notes and $

250 million

of

4.05%

ten

-year senior notes.  The net proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, which included a partial redemption of $

250 million

of the outstanding principal amount of the existing

5.75%

senior notes due 2015.  The redemption settled in October 2013 with a total cash outflow of approximately $

275 million

including a

$24 million

cost for early redemption.

In February 2013, the Company repaid its

4.850%

fixed rate

$250 million

senior notes that matured using cash.

During the first quarter of 2012, the Company repaid its

6.25%

fixed rate

$250 million

senior notes that matured.  The Company used proceeds from the issuance of

2.3%

five

-year

$250 million

senior notes in the first quarter of 2012 to fund the maturing notes.


The Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries maintain a $

1.0 billion

multi-currency unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in October 2016.  The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly.  There were

no

borrowings outstanding under this facility at

December 31, 2013

.

In December 2012, the Company closed on a $

50 million

three

-year term loan facility. The interest rate on this facility at

December 31, 2013

was

1.29%

, which is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings.  The facility requires the Company to maintain coverage ratios and leverage ratios consistent with the revolving credit facility discussed above.  The Company had

$50 million

of borrowings under this facility at

December 31, 2013

.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In February 2011, the Company entered into

two

$125 million

3.5

-year interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of the first

$250 million

of the outstanding

5.375%

senior notes due in 2014.

Under the terms of the swaps, the counter-parties will pay the Company a fixed rate of

5.375%

and the Company will pay interest at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of

3.726%

. The maturity date of the senior notes and the swaps match exactly. The floating rate resets quarterly, with every second reset occurring on the interest payment date of the senior notes. The swaps net settle every

six

months on the senior note coupon payment dates. The swaps are designated as fair value hedging instruments and are deemed to be perfectly effective in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The fair value of the swaps at inception was

zero

and subsequent changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are reflected in the carrying value of the interest rate swaps and in the consolidated balance sheet. The carrying value of the debt on the balance sheet was adjusted by an equal amount. The gain or loss on the hedged item (fixed rate debt) and the offsetting gain or (loss) on the interest rate swaps for the periods ended

December 31, 2013

and


is as follows:

The amounts earned and owed under the swap agreements are accrued each period and are reported in interest expense. There was

no

ineffectiveness recognized in the periods presented.

Additional credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit are maintained with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $


million at

December 31, 2013

and $


million at

December 31, 2012

.  There was

$1 million

outstanding borrowings under these facilities at

December 31, 2013

and

no

outstanding borrowings under these facilities at

December 31, 2012

.

Scheduled repayments of long-term debt in 2014 and in the four succeeding years are $


million, $


million, $


million, $


million and $


million, respectively.

Fair value of Short-term and Long-term Debt

The estimated fair value of the Company’s short-term and long-term debt is provided below. Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company’s intent or need to dispose of the financial instrument.


The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt, which consists primarily of term debt maturing within the next year, approximates its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a primary portion of the Company’s long-term debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Short and long-term debt would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

13.    Integration and Restructuring Costs

In 2013, the Company implemented restructuring actions which resulted in costs totaling $

22 million

.

Restructuring costs consist primarily of severance and benefits, costs for future rent and other real estate costs. Th

ese costs were incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance Services—$

7 million

; Consulting—$

2 million

; and Corporate—$

13 million

.

Details of the restructuring liability activity from January 1, 2012 through

December 31, 2013

, including actions taken prior to


are as follows:

As of January 1, 2011, the liability balance related to restructuring activity was

$211 million

.  In 2011, the Company accrued

$51 million

and had cash payments of

$82 million

related to restructuring activities that resulted in the liability balance at January 1, 2012 reported above.

The expenses associated with the above initiatives are included in compensation and benefits and other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The liabilities associated with these initiatives are classified on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable, other liabilities, or accrued compensation and employee benefits, depending on the nature of the items.

14.    Common Stock

During


, the Company repurchased

13.2 million

shares of its common stock for total consideration of

$550 million

.  In May 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized share repurchases of up to

$1 billion

of the Company's common stock.  The Company remains authorized to purchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of

$563 million

.  There is no time limit on the authorization.  During 2012, the Company purchased

6.9 million

shares of its common stock for total consideration of

$230 million

.


15.    Claims, Lawsuits and Other Contingencies

Errors and Omissions Claims

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such claims and lawsuits consist principally of alleged errors and omissions in connection with the performance of professional services, including the placement of insurance, the provision of actuarial services for corporate and public sector clients, and the provision of consulting services relating to the drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other documentation governing pension plans. Errors and omissions claims may seek damages, including punitive and treble damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant. In establishing liabilities for errors and omissions claims in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic No. 450-20 (Contingencies-Loss Contingencies), the Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses. A liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable.

To the extent that expected losses exceed our deductible in any policy year, the Company also records an asset for the amount that we expect to recover under any available third-party insurance programs. The Company has varying levels of third-party insurance coverage, with policy limits and coverage terms varying significantly by policy year.

Governmental Inquiries and Related Claims

In January 2005, the Company and its subsidiary Marsh Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the New York State Attorney General (

“

NYAG

”

) and the New York State Insurance Department to settle a civil complaint and related citation regarding Marsh

'

s use of market service agreements with various insurance companies. The parties subsequently entered into an amended and restated settlement agreement in February 2010 that restored a level playing field for Marsh.

Numerous private party lawsuits based on similar allegations to those made in the NYAG complaint were commenced against the Company, one or more of its subsidiaries, and their current and former directors and officers. The vast majority of these matters have been resolved.

Two

actions instituted by policyholders against the Company, Marsh and certain Marsh subsidiaries remain pending.

Our activities are regulated under the laws of the United States and its various states, the European Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In the ordinary course of business the Company is also subject to subpoenas, investigations, lawsuits and/or other regulatory actions undertaken by governmental authorities. In this regard, in November 2013, Mercer received a subpoena from the New York Department of Financial Services in connection with a review of New York's public pension funds.

Other Contingencies

-

Guarantees

In connection with its acquisition of U.K.-based Sedgwick Group in 1998, the Company acquired several insurance underwriting businesses that were already in run-off, including River Thames Insurance Company Limited (

“

River Thames

”

), which the Company sold in 2001. Sedgwick guaranteed payment of claims on certain policies underwritten through the Institute of London Underwriters (the

“

ILU

”

) by River Thames. The policies covered by this guarantee are reinsured up to

£40 million

by a related party of River Thames. Payment of claims under the reinsurance agreement is collateralized by segregated assets held in a trust. As of December 31, 2013, the reinsurance coverage exceeded the best estimate of the projected liability of the policies covered by the guarantee. To the extent River Thames or the reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations under those policies, a claimant may seek to recover from us under the guarantee.


From 1980 to 1983, the Company owned indirectly the English

& American Insurance Company (

“

E&A

”

), which was a member of the ILU. The ILU required the Company to guarantee a portion of E&A

'

s obligations. After E&A became insolvent in 1993, the ILU agreed to discharge the guarantee in exchange for the Company

'

s agreement to post an evergreen letter of credit that is available to pay claims by policyholders on certain E&A policies issued through the ILU and incepting between July

3, 1980 and October

6, 1983. Certain claims have been paid under the letter of credit and we anticipate that additional claimants may seek to recover against the letter of credit.

Kroll-related Matters

Under the terms of a stock purchase agreement with Altegrity, Inc. (

“

Altegrity

”

) related to Altegrity

'

s purchase of Kroll from the Company in August 2010, a copy of which is attached as an exhibit to the Company

'

s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June

30, 2010, the Company agreed to provide a limited indemnity to Altegrity with respect to certain Kroll-related litigation and regulatory matters.

The pending proceedings and other matters described in this Note 15 on Claims, Lawsuits and Other Contingencies may expose the Company or its subsidiaries to liability for significant monetary damages and other forms of relief. Where a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company establishes liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic No.

450-20 (Contingencies

-

Loss Contingencies). Except as described above, the Company is not able at this time to provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on the Company

'

s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. This is primarily because these matters are still developing and involve complex issues subject to inherent uncertainty. Adverse determinations in one or more of these matters could have a material impact on the Company

'

s consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a future period.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

(1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures relating to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; the recording of all necessary transactions to permit the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; the proper authorization of receipts and expenditures in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and the prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued in 1992. Based on its evaluation, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that audited and reported on the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, also issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.

Audit Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

New York, New York

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.


We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
