INFORMATION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements,” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which express management’s current views concerning future events or results, use words like “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “project” and similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like “could,” “should,” “will” and “would.” For example, we may use forward-looking statements when addressing topics such as: the impact of acquisitions and dispositions; future actions by our management or regulators; the outcome of contingencies; changes in our business strategy; changes in our business practices and methods of generating revenue; the development and performance of our services and products; market
and industry conditions, including competitive and pricing trends; changes in the composition or level of MMC’s revenues; our cost structure and the outcome of restructuring and other cost-saving initiatives; and MMC’s cash flow and liquidity.

Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements include:

the economic and reputational impact of litigation and regulatory proceedings concerning our

insurance and reinsurance brokerage and investment management operations;

the fact that MMC’s agreement to sell Putnam, announced on February 1, 2007, is subject to a

number of closing conditions, some of which are outside of MMC’s control, and we cannot be

certain that the transaction will close as planned or that the announced sale price will not be

adjusted pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement;

Putnam’s performance between now and the closing of the announced sale later in 2007, including

the actual and relative investment performance of Putnam’s mutual funds and institutional

and other advisory accounts, Putnam’s net fund flows and the level of Putnam’s assets under

management;

our ability to effectively deploy MMC’s proceeds from the sale of Putnam, and the timing of our use

of those proceeds;

the fact that our estimate of the dilutive impact of the sale of Putnam on MMC’s future earnings per

share is necessarily based on a set of current management assumptions, including assumptions

about MMC’s use of sale proceeds and the operating results of Putnam and MMC’s other

subsidiaries;

our ability to achieve profitable revenue growth in our risk and insurance services segment by

providing both traditional insurance brokerage services and additional risk advisory services;

our ability to retain existing clients and attract new business, and our ability to retain key

employees;

revenue fluctuations in risk and insurance services relating to the net effect of new and lost

business production and the timing of policy inception dates;

the impact on risk and insurance services commission revenues of changes in the availability of,

and the premiums insurance carriers charge for, insurance and reinsurance products, including

the impact on premium rates and market capacity attributable to catastrophic events such as

hurricanes;

the impact on renewals in our risk and insurance services segment of pricing trends in particular

insurance markets, fluctuations in the general level of economic activity and decisions by insureds

with respect to the level of risk they will self-insure;

the impact on our consulting segment of pricing trends, utilization rates, legislative changes

affecting client demand, and the general economic environment;

i

our ability to implement our restructuring initiatives and otherwise reduce or control expenses and

achieve operating efficiencies, including our ability to generate anticipated savings and operational

improvements from the actions we announced in September 2006;

the impact of competition, including with respect to pricing and the emergence of new competitors;

fluctuations in the value of Risk Capital Holdings’ investments;

our ability to make strategic acquisitions and dispositions and to integrate, and realize expected

synergies, savings or strategic benefits from, the businesses we acquire;

our exposure to potential liabilities arising from errors and omissions claims against us;

our ability to meet our financing needs by generating cash from operations and accessing external

financing sources, including the potential impact of rating agency actions on our cost of financing

or ability to borrow;

the impact on our operating results of foreign exchange fluctuations;

potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, particularly given the global scope of our operations; and

changes in the tax or accounting treatment of our operations, and the impact of other legislation

and regulation, including as to licensing matters, in the jurisdictions in which we operate

.

The factors identified above are not exhaustive. MMC and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Accordingly, MMC cautions readers not to place undue reliance on its forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. MMC undertakes no obligation to update any such statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made.

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006

__________________________

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

References in this report to “we”, “us” and “our” are to Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (“MMC”) and one or more of its subsidiaries, as the context requires.

GENERAL

MMC is a global professional services firm. Through our subsidiaries, we provide clients with analysis, advice and transactional capabilities across four operating segments:

Risk and Insurance Services,

which includes risk management activities (risk advice, risk

transfer and risk prevention and mitigation solutions) as well as insurance and reinsurance

broking and services;

Risk Consulting and Technology,

which includes risk consulting and related investigative,

quantitative, intelligence, financial, security and technology services;

Consulting,

which includes human resource consulting and related services, and specialized

management and economic consulting services; and

Investment Management,

which includes investment management for both individual and

institutional investors.

Our approximately 55,000 employees serve a diverse range of clients in more than 100 countries. In our Risk and Insurance Services, Risk Consulting and Technology, and Consulting segments, our worldwide client base includes corporations in numerous industries, small and mid-size businesses, governments and other public entities, not-for-profit organizations and individuals. Our Investment Management business serves both institutional and individual investors, primarily in the United States. We provide financial information about our segments in our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.

OUR BUSINESSES

Risk and Insurance Services

Risk and Insurance Services is MMC’s largest business segment, generating approximately 45% of total operating segments revenue in 2006 and employing approximately 28,000 colleagues worldwide. In this segment, our subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents, consultants, and advisors for insureds, insurance and reinsurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of:

risk management, insurance broking, consulting and insurance program management

services, primarily under the name of

Marsh

; and

reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory

functions, primarily under the name of

Guy Carpenter

.


Marsh

Marsh and its subsidiaries, primarily organized under Marsh Inc., operate through a global network of approximately 400 offices in over 100 countries. The Marsh companies provide risk management, insurance broking, consulting and insurance program management services to a wide range of businesses, government entities and professional service organizations around the world. Marsh’s clients vary by size, industry, geography and risk exposure.

Client Relationships.

In its main risk consulting and insurance broking practice, Marsh employs a team approach to address its clients’ individual risk management and insurance needs. Each client relationship is coordinated by a client executive who assembles the resources needed to analyze, measure and manage the client’s various risks. The client executive draws from colleagues who specialize in specific industries (e.g., financial services, telecom, life sciences, health care, construction, transportation) and/or risk specialty areas (e.g., property, casualty, workers compensation, environmental, aviation, marine & energy, political risk, financial and professional liability).

Risk Analysis.

Marsh’s risk and insurance professionals identify, analyze and estimate risks that arise from client operations and assets. These client risks relate to physical damage to property, various liability exposures, and other factors that could result in financial loss, as well as large and complex risks that require access to world insurance and financial markets. Marsh professionals address traditional property and liability risks and a widening range of financial, strategic and operating exposures, including those relating to employment practices, the development and operation of technology resources, intellectual property, the remediation of environmental pollution, mergers and acquisitions, the interruption of revenue streams derived from leasing and credit operations and political risks.

Risk Advice.

Marsh advises clients in structuring programs for retaining, mitigating, financing, and transferring risk in combinations that vary according to the client’s particular needs and circumstances. In addition to insurance, Marsh might help a client develop risk management strategies that include loss-control services (such as business continuity planning, ergonomic and workplace safety programs and loss information management), or alternative risk financing (such as the securitization of risk, the placement of risk with the capital markets and self-insured programs). Marsh’s professionals help clients implement their risk management and mitigation strategies by negotiating and executing transactions with the worldwide insurance and capital markets, establishing and managing specialized insurance companies owned by clients (sometimes known as “captive
insurance companies”) and implementing various loss-control programs.

Global Consumer Practice and Other Activities.

In addition to its main risk management and broking practice described above, Marsh operates a global consumer practice that provides advice, broking and program management services to corporate and association clients globally and to individual and small business clients primarily in the United States. Marsh professionals in this practice design, market and administer a variety of insurance and insurance-related products and services, such as consumer property and casualty programs and life insurance, purchased by an association’s or professional group’s members or provided to employees of corporate clients as part of a voluntary payroll deduction program. Other areas of the consumer practice include: private client services, which provides specialized risk and insurance programs to high-net-worth individuals and family offices;
Marsh financial services, which offers key-person and executive benefit programs, as well as planning and wealth preservation solutions to affluent individuals; and a small commercial practice, which offers standardized insurance programs to small businesses and franchise operations. Marsh subsidiaries also provide insurance support services such as claims collection, claims advocacy, injury management, claims administration, and other insurance- and risk- related services.


Subsidiaries in the Risk and Insurance Services segment, under various names apart from Marsh, also provide underwriting management services to insurers in the United States and Canada, primarily for professional liability coverages.

Guy Carpenter

Guy Carpenter’s approximately 2,600 professionals around the world provide their clients with reinsurance solutions that include:

risk management modeling and advice;

the placement of reinsurance coverage with reinsurance markets worldwide;

risk-transfer financing in the capital markets;

contract and claims management; and

run-off services administration.

Reinsurance is a form of risk transfer that an insurance company or other risk assumption entity (such as a captive insurer or a governmental entity) purchases in order to reduce its exposure to liability on the insurance policies it has written. The purchaser of reinsurance spreads its risk by transferring (or “ceding”) a portion of its underwriting liability to another insurance provider, which is known as the “reinsurer.” Reinsurance enables the ceding entity, among other things, to expand its underwriting capacity, stabilize its underwriting results, secure protection against large or unexpected losses, or withdraw from (“run-off”) a class or line of business in an orderly fashion.

Acting as a broker or intermediary on all classes of reinsurance, Guy Carpenter places two main types of property and casualty reinsurance. Treaty reinsurance involves the transfer of a portfolio of risks. Facultative reinsurance entails the transfer of part or all of the coverage provided by a single insurance policy.

Guy Carpenter also provides reinsurance services in a broad range of specialty practice areas, including accident and health, agriculture, alternative risk transfer, environmental, general casualty, investment banking, life and annuity, marine and energy, professional liability, program manager solutions, property, retrocessional reinsurance (reinsurance between reinsurers), structured risk, surety, terror risk, and workers compensation. In addition, Guy Carpenter provides its clients with numerous reinsurance-related services, such as actuarial, enterprise risk management, financial and regulatory consulting and portfolio analysis. Guy Carpenter’s Instrat

®

unit delivers advanced risk assessment analytics, catastrophe modeling and exposure management tools to assist clients in the reinsurance decision-making process.

Guy Carpenter offers run-off services for inactive clients in North America and elsewhere through Reinsurance Solutions International, LLC and ReSolutions International Limited, respectively. These subsidiaries also offer reinsurance and insurance administration solutions on a fee basis.

Marsh & McLennan Risk Capital Holdings

MMC owns investments in private equity funds and insurance and financial services firms through its subsidiary Marsh & McLennan Risk Capital Holdings (“Risk Capital Holdings”).

Compensation for Services

Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts


and negotiations with clients. For billing and other administrative services, Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others.

We also receive certain investment-related revenues from Risk Capital Holdings. For a more detailed discussion of revenue sources and factors affecting revenue in our Risk and Insurance Services segment, see Item 7 (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) of this report.

Investment Management

MMC conducts business in its Investment Management segment through

Putnam Investments Trust

and its subsidiaries. Investment Management generated 12% of total operating segments revenue in 2006 and employs approximately 2,600 colleagues as of January 1, 2007. Primarily through its office in Boston, Massachusetts, Putnam provides investment management and related services through a broad range of investment products, including its own family of mutual funds, which are offered to individual and institutional investors. Putnam has been engaged in the investment management business since 1937 and is one of the largest mutual fund managers in the United States. In addition to its Boston headquarters, Putnam has offices in London and Tokyo.

On January 31, 2007, MMC entered into an agreement with Great-West Lifeco Inc. (“GWL”), a majority-owned subsidiary of Power Financial Corporation, pursuant to which GWL agreed to purchase Putnam for $3.9 billion in cash. The parties expect the transaction to close in mid-2007, subject to regulatory consents and other contractually-provided closing conditions. For more detailed information regarding the sale of Putnam, see Item 7 (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) of this report.

Investment Management Services

Putnam provides investment management and related services through a broad range of investment products that are offered directly or through intermediaries to both individual and institutional investors. Products that Putnam sponsors for individual retail investors include a family of open-end and closed-end mutual funds (the “Putnam Funds”), college savings plans, annuity products and offshore products. Putnam also provides investment management services on a separately managed or commingled basis to individuals, corporate profit-sharing and pension funds, state and other governmental and public employee retirement funds, university endowment funds, charitable foundations, collective investment vehicles (both U.S. and non-U.S.) and other domestic and foreign institutional accounts. Putnam also provides investment management services in the capacity of sub-advisor for investment products sponsored or co-sponsored by
other institutions.

Putnam manages its mutual funds, institutional client accounts and other portfolios in order to meet varying investment objectives, and to afford investors in the Putnam Funds and other clients the opportunity to allocate their investments among various investment products as their changing needs and worldwide economic and market conditions warrant. The investment process used by Putnam in managing its assets is based upon both fundamental and quantitative research. Fundamental research includes valuation analysis, economic, political, industry and company research, company visits, and the utilization of such sources as company public records and activities, management interviews, company-prepared information, and other publicly available information, as well as analyses of suppliers, customers and competitors. Quantitative analysis includes the analysis of past trends and the use of sophisticated financial modeling to gauge how
particular securities may perform. Putnam also incorporates a risk-management capability that analyzes securities across all the Putnam Funds and other portfolios to identify areas of over-concentration and potential risks.


Putnam’s assets under management consisted of the following levels and composition at December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in $ billions):

Markets for Putnam’s Services and Products

Retail

. Putnam generally markets its investment products for individual investors to intermediaries such as broker-dealers, financial planners, and registered investment advisers, who use them to meet the investment needs and objectives of their clients’ overall investment programs. These products consist of:

the Putnam Funds;

insurance products, such as variable annuities and variable life insurance policies, that use

mutual funds as the underlying funding vehicles; and

separately managed accounts and other platforms sponsored by broker-dealers, financial

planners and registered investment advisers.

The Putnam Funds are publicly-held investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. These retail mutual funds cover a broad range of domestic and international equity, fixed-income, blended and money market investment portfolios. As of December 31, 2006, the Putnam Funds included 96 open-end investment companies (mutual funds), which are available for


investments and withdrawals on most business days; and 11 closed-end funds, which are not available for investments or withdrawals but the shares of which are traded on various major domestic stock exchanges.

Institutional.

Putnam provides investment management services and products to defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans sponsored by corporations, state, municipal and other governmental authorities, retirement plans sponsored by unions under the Taft-Hartley Act, endowments, foundations and other institutional customers. Putnam provides its products and services to defined contribution plans in various ways, including through financial intermediaries, on a bundled basis in conjunction with its affiliate Mercer Human Resources Services, or on an “investment only” basis typically for larger plans. In the employee benefit plan market, investment options are usually selected by the plan sponsors and may include Putnam mutual funds and other Putnam-managed products, as well as employer stock and other investments that are not managed by Putnam. In addition, Putnam
offers its investment services directly to employee benefit plans, endowments, foundations and other institutional investors, either as separate accounts or in the form of collective trusts and other pooled vehicles that are made available solely to institutional investors.

International.

Putnam provides investment management products and services in a number of international markets, including Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and several other countries. Putnam markets its products and services to both retail and institutional clients in most of these countries, through direct sales and marketing activities, joint ventures and independent distributors.

Private Equity.

Putnam offers private equity and alternative investment funds to institutional and high-net-worth individual investors in conjunction with Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P., or THL, a private equity firm. Putnam has a joint venture arrangement with THL and THL’s partners in connection with which it owns a minority interest in THL for purposes of participating in THL’s traditional business of managing private equity and leveraged buyout funds. Putnam and certain of its employees also are investors in certain of these private equity and other funds.

In support of Putnam’s primary investment management business, Putnam subsidiaries provide other related services, including transfer agency, underwriting, distribution, shareholder services, custodial, trustee and other fiduciary services. PFTC, a Massachusetts trust company, serves as transfer agent, dividend disbursing agent, registrar and, until recently, custodian for the Putnam Funds and provides custody services to certain commingled and other accounts. As of December 31, 2006, custody and fund accounting services for the Putnam Funds were transferred to State Street Bank and Trust Company. In the future, Putnam may also transfer custody and fund accounting services for certain commingled and other accounts to an outside service provider.

Putnam Retail Management Limited Partnership, or PRM, a Putnam subsidiary and a registered broker-dealer and member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, or NASD, acts as principal underwriter of the shares of the open-end Putnam Funds, selling primarily through independent broker-dealers, financial planners and financial institutions, including banks, and directly to certain large 401(k) plans and other institutional accounts.

Compensation for Services

Putnam’s revenue is derived primarily from investment management and 12b-1 fees received from the Putnam Funds and investment management fees for institutional accounts. Putnam also receives fees from the Putnam Funds for administrative services performed by PFTC. For a more detailed discussion of revenue sources and factors affecting revenue in our Investment Management segment, see Item 7 (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) of this report.


Regulation

MMC’s activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under United States federal and state laws, as well as laws of other countries in which MMC’s subsidiaries operate. See Item 1A (“Risk Factors”) below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses.

Risk and Insurance Services.

While laws and regulations vary from location to location, every state of the United States and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers (such as insurance brokers, agents and consultants, reinsurance brokers, managing general agents and third party administrators) to hold an individual and/or company license from a governmental agency or self-regulatory organization. Some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locally-owned business entities; in this case, if MMC has no licensed subsidiary, we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction.

Beginning in January 2005, all European Union member states were required to implement the Insurance Mediation Directive. This Directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance intermediaries, including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence, financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance. As member states of the European Union adopt regulations to comply with the Directive, our insurance intermediary operations in the European Union have become or will become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements. In January 2005, as part of the implementation of the Directive in the United Kingdom, the power and responsibilities of the Financial Services Authority, or FSA, were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the United Kingdom.

Insurance authorities in the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which MMC’s subsidiaries do business, including the FSA in the United Kingdom, also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them.

Certain of MMC’s risk and insurance services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment, securities and futures licensing authorities. In the United States, Marsh and Guy Carpenter use the services of MMC Securities Corp., an NASD-registered broker dealer and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of MMC, primarily in connection with investment banking-related services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions. In the European Union, these businesses receive securities transfer services from another MMC subsidiary, MMC Securities Ltd., which is regulated by the FSA for the conduct of investment business in the United Kingdom.

In some jurisdictions, insurance-related taxes may be due either directly from clients or from the insurance broker. In the latter case, the broker customarily looks to the client for payment.

Risk Consulting and Technology.

Certain of Kroll’s risk consulting and investigative activities are licensed and regulated at the federal, state and local level in the United States and abroad. Many of these activities also involve the use of data from outside sources, including third party vendors and governmental records. As a result, changes in existing, or the implementation of new, laws and regulations, particularly relating to privacy, could interfere with Kroll’s historical access to and use of such data. Substance abuse testing laboratories operated by a Kroll subsidiary are certified on the federal level and licensed in a number of states.

Consulting.

Certain of Mercer HR’s retirement-related consulting services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries, including by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, in the United States and the FSA in the United Kingdom. In addition, the trustee services, investment services (including advice to individuals on the investment of personal pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities) and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by Mercer Human Resource Consulting and its


subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions. The benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by Mercer Human Resource Consulting and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our Risk and Insurance Services businesses. In the United States, Mercer Human Resource Consulting and Mercer Management Consulting use the services of MMC Securities Corp. primarily in connection with the sale of retirement and employee benefit plans, and investment banking services, respectively.

Investment Management.

Virtually all aspects of Putnam’s investment management business are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by various federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities. Putnam’s activities are subject to regulation by the SEC and other federal, state and self-regulatory authorities in the United States, by the FSA in the United Kingdom, by the Financial Services Agency in Japan, and by the national securities regulatory authorities in certain other countries in which it does business. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) imposes numerous obligations on certain of Putnam’s subsidiaries which are registered in the United States as investment advisers, including record-keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act
of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) imposes similar obligations on the investment companies that are advised by Putnam. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration.

Competitive Conditions

MMC faces strong competition in all of its business segments from providers of similar products and services. MMC also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees.

Risk and Insurance Services.

MMC’s combined insurance and reinsurance broking services business is the world’s largest of its kind. The principal bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance businesses compete include the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. MMC encounters strong competition in the risk and insurance services business from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants, that provide risk-related services and products.

Certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance (including captive insurance companies) as a supplement or alternative to third-party insurance, thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements. There are also many other providers of affinity group and private client services, including specialized firms, insurance companies and other institutions.

The continuing impact of legal and regulatory proceedings concerning our insurance brokerage operations also could affect Marsh’s competitive position. These proceedings are discussed in more detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Please also read our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact under Item 1A (“Risk Factors”) below.

Risk Consulting and Technology.

In risk consulting and technology, we face competition from local, regional, national and international firms that provide similar services in the fields of accounting, corporate advisory and restructuring services, investigative and security services, consulting and technology services. Kroll’s Consulting Services Group faces competition from local, regional, national


and international accounting firms and forensic accounting, litigation support, investigative and other specialist and consulting firms. Kroll’s Corporate Advisory & Restructuring Group faces competition from national and international accounting firms and specialist recovery firms. Kroll’s Security Group faces competition from international and local security firms, government security contractors, and architectural engineering firms. Kroll’s Technology Services Group faces competition from small, independent service providers and technology companies.

Consulting.

MMC’s consulting and HR outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies, as well as regional and local firms. These businesses compete generally on the basis of the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. Competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms, as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms.

Mercer Investment Consulting faces competition from many sources, including multi-manager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions. Mercer Global Investments, Mercer HR’s recently established multi-manager business, in particular faces significant competition from better-established rivals with greater experience in that market.

In many cases, clients have the option of handling the services provided by Mercer internally, without assistance from outside advisors.

Investment Management.

Putnam’s investment management business is highly competitive. Putnam competes with other providers of investment products and services primarily on the basis of the range of investment products offered, investment performance, distribution, scope and quality of shareholder and other services, and general reputation in the marketplace. Sales of Putnam Fund shares are also influenced by general securities market conditions, government regulations, global economic conditions and advertising and sales promotional efforts. Putnam competes with other mutual fund firms and institutional asset managers that offer investment products similar to Putnam’s as well as products which Putnam does not offer, including passively managed funds such as index funds. Putnam also experiences competition from a number of mutual fund sponsors that offer their funds to
the general public without sales charges, which Putnam does not do.

Many securities dealers, whose large retail distribution systems play an important role in the sale of shares in the Putnam Funds, also sponsor competing proprietary mutual funds. To the extent that such securities dealers value the ability to offer customers a broad selection of investment alternatives, they will continue to sell independent funds, such as Putnam’s, notwithstanding the availability of proprietary products. However, to the extent that these firms limit or restrict the sale of Putnam Fund shares through their brokerage systems in favor of their proprietary mutual funds, Putnam’s assets under management, and thus Putnam’s revenues, might decline.

In addition to the preceding discussion, see “Risk Factors –Competitive Risks,” in Part 1A of this report.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating MMC and its businesses. The risks described below have the potential to materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Litigation-Related Risks

Continuing legal and regulatory proceedings concerning MMC may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

In January 2005, MMC and its subsidiary Marsh entered into an agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with the New York State Attorney General (“NYAG”) and the New York State Insurance Department (“NYSID”) to settle a civil complaint filed in New York State court by NYAG in October 2004 (the “NYAG Lawsuit”) and a related citation (the “Citation”) issued by NYSID at approximately the same time. Among other things, the NYAG Lawsuit and the Citation had alleged that Marsh’s use of market service agreements with various insurance companies entailed fraudulent business practices, bid-rigging, illegal restraint of trade and other violations of the New York business and insurance statutes, and was not adequately disclosed to Marsh’s clients or MMC’s investors. Following the announcement of the NYAG Lawsuit and related actions taken by MMC, MMC’s stock price
dropped from approximately $45 per share to a low of approximately $22.75 per share.

Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, MMC established a fund of $850 million, payable over four years, for policyholder clients in the U.S who placed insurance through Marsh between 2001 and 2004. Approximately 70,000 eligible policyholders have elected to receive an aggregate distribution of approximately $750 million under this fund.

Notwithstanding the Settlement Agreement, numerous other lawsuits have been commenced against us, one or more of our subsidiaries, and our current and former directors and officers, relating to matters alleged in the NYAG Lawsuit. Numerous putative class action suits purportedly brought on behalf of policyholders and our shareholders against us, certain of our subsidiaries and certain of our current and former officers and directors are pending in various federal and state courts and in Canada. Shareholder derivative suits have been filed in various jurisdictions. There are also several actions brought by individual policyholders and additional suits may be filed by other policyholders. The myriad claims asserted in these suits include alleged violations of federal securities and antitrust laws, ERISA, RICO, and other statutory and common law claims, and seek significant damages. In addition, the States of Connecticut and Florida
have brought lawsuits against MMC and Marsh.

Further, following the filing of the NYAG Lawsuit, MMC and certain of its subsidiaries received notices of investigations and inquiries, together with requests for documents and information, from attorneys general, departments of insurance and other governmental entities in a significant number of jurisdictions (other than New York) that relate to the allegations in the NYAG Lawsuit. MMC also has been contacted by certain state attorneys general and commissioners of insurance indicating that they may seek additional monetary or other remedies from MMC.

An adverse outcome under any of the lawsuits and regulatory actions involving MMC and its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The lawsuits and regulatory actions also could result in negative publicity, reputational damage and harm to our client and employee relationships. Any of these developments could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

For further information about the above and other legal and regulatory matters involving MMC and its subsidiaries, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.


MMC has agreed to retain specified liabilities of Putnam, the outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

On February 1, 2007, we announced our agreement to sell Putnam to Great-West Lifeco., Inc., which we expect to close in mid-2007. Under the stock purchase agreement relating to the sale, MMC has agreed to indemnify Great-West Lifeco., Inc. for liabilities that may arise in connection with specified regulatory and litigation matters involving Putnam, including certain claims, litigation or investigations relating to “excessive fees” or “market-timing.” The matters for which MMC has retained indemnification obligations are more fully described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Adverse outcomes in the matters for which MMC has retained indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Risks Relating to Our Business Model and Operations

We may not be as successful as we hope in implementing Marsh’s evolving business model.

Since 2004, Marsh has made significant changes to its business model, including the elimination of market service agreements with insurers. The elimination of market service revenue has negatively affected our financial results. In 2004, we recognized market service revenue of $516 million, relating to insurance placements made before October 1, 2004. In 2005 and 2006, respectively, we recognized $114 million and $43 million of market service revenue relating to placements made before October 1, 2004.

Under MMC’s current business model, Marsh seeks to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that are disclosed to its clients, and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of value-added risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities. Marsh’s current business and compensation model continues to evolve and in some respects remains untested. We cannot be certain that it will generate the profitable revenue growth we are targeting. The inability to derive adequate revenues from Marsh’s current business and compensation model may significantly impede improvement in our operating results and profitability.

We may not achieve all the cost savings and operational improvements we expect from our September 2006 restructuring initiative and other changes to our MMC-wide operating model.

In September 2006, we announced a series of restructuring and other initiatives designed to enhance MMC’s operational efficiency and improve our profitability. These initiatives, which involve information technology, real estate, corporate functions, and operating company business processes, are expected to yield annualized savings of approximately $350 million by the end of 2008, with associated charges of approximately $225 million. We cannot be certain that we will achieve our targeted cost savings and operational improvements on the announced timetable, or at all. If we do not, the impact of the 2006 restructuring initiatives on our operating margin will not be as significant as we currently expect.

In addition, MMC believes that future revenue growth will partly depend on increased collaboration among MMC’s operating companies in accessing their respective client bases. Similarly, MMC believes that improvements to its future operating efficiency will depend on its ability to rationalize and consolidate business processes and infrastructure across the entire company. Our attempt to achieve these goals entails risks because MMC, due in part to its history of growth through acquisitions, has not traditionally operated in the integrated fashion that management currently envisions. For example, to achieve the above goals we must improve and rationalize our technology infrastructure; standardize a variety of business operational functions; develop increasingly scalable services; improve our ability to market services across our operating companies; create compensation systems that track


and reward cross-business collaboration; and market MMC’s brands in a more unified manner. Any inability to execute these changes may significantly impede improvement in our operating results and profitability.

We are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “errors and omissions” claims.

MMC’s operating companies provide numerous services for clients around the world. For example, Marsh advises on and places insurance coverage, and sometimes provides related services such as risk management advice and claims management and collections. Guy Carpenter performs similar services in its role as a reinsurance broker. Mercer renders a variety of consulting and investment management services. As a result of these and other activities, MMC operating companies are potentially subject to errors and omissions, or E&O, claims by clients and third parties who may allege that they were damaged as a result of MMC’s failure to perform its duties as expected. MMC works hard to minimize its potential E&O exposures by, among other things, prevention and remediation efforts and employee education/training, but it is not possible to prevent E&O exposures completely. When E&O claims do arise, claimants often
seek monetary damages. In the case of Marsh and Guy Carpenter, claimants may allege losses representing the value of insurance or reinsurance coverage lost due to broker negligence. In the case of Mercer, claimants may allege losses due to negligent investment or consulting advice.

E&O claims in any given case can be significant and may subject MMC, in addition to potential liability for monetary damages, to reputational harm and diversion of personnel and management resources. Since 2001, the worldwide market for professional liability insurance for E&O claims in the financial services industry has contracted significantly, which has caused MMC to assume increasing levels of self-insurance for its potential E&O exposures. MMC uses internal actuarial and other estimates, and case-level reviews by inside and outside counsel, to establish loss reserves which it believes are adequate to provide for this self-insured retention. These reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. Nevertheless, given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation which could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse
effect on MMC’s financial condition or results of operations in a given quarterly or annual period. For further information about our E&O exposure and related insurance coverage, including self-insurance, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements appearing under Item 8 of this report.

Credit rating downgrades could negatively affect our financing costs if we need to raise additional capital.

MMC’s credit rating was lowered following the filing of the NYAG Lawsuit in October 2004, and both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s currently have MMC on a negative credit outlook. If we need to raise capital in the future (for example, in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives), any further credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources.

We may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire.

We have a history of numerous acquisitions, including our $1.9 billion acquisition of Kroll in July 2004; nine acquisitions in 2005 for total consideration of $68 million; and 16 acquisitions in 2006 for total consideration of $200 million. We expect that acquisitions will continue to be a part of our growth strategy.

Acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect. In addition, acquisitions involve special risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired


businesses. While we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations.

We are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations.

We do business worldwide, and we plan to expand our operations further into Asia and other foreign markets. This subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational and market risks. These risks include, among others:

the economic and political conditions in foreign countries;

the imposition of local investment or other restrictions by foreign governments;

potential costs and difficulties in complying, or monitoring compliance, with rules relating to

trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the requirements

of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the rules thereunder, or other U.S. laws and

regulations applicable to business operations abroad;

the imposition of controls or limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies or remittance

of dividends and other payments from foreign subsidiaries;

the imposition of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments from

subsidiaries;

difficulties in monitoring employees in geographically dispersed locations; and

potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations

administered by foreign government agencies.

Some of our subsidiaries in foreign countries receive revenue that differs from their functional currencies. Also, we generally must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we may use derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse effects due to exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate these risks, and significant changes in exchange rates may have an adverse effect on our financial results.

Competitive Risks

Each of our businesses operates in a highly competitive environment.

We encounter strong competition for talent in our risk and insurance services business. This competition comes from other insurance brokerage firms which also operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms throughout the world, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses that provide risk-related services. Our consulting and risk consulting and technology businesses compete with independent consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms around the world, and experience significant competition for talent. Any inability to respond successfully to this competition could have a material negative impact on our business or results of operations.

In addition, growing competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include:

the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds without the involvement

of a broker or other market intermediary;

changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory investigations;


an increase in competition from existing or recently-formed insurance brokers who have not

agreed to limit their use of market service arrangements, thereby giving them a competitive

advantage over those brokers, such as Marsh, which have agreed to limit the use of such

arrangements;

the establishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance

or reinsurance or other alternative types of coverage in catastrophe-prone areas; and

the creation of in-house servicing capabilities by insurance companies or by certain insurance

consumers which compete with the third party administration and other administration,

servicing and risk management products offered by our consulting and risk consulting and

technology segments.

Increased competition as a result of these developments could cause the supply of, and demand for, our products and services to change, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We may experience loss of key personnel and clients.

Across all of our businesses, we must preserve our capabilities to serve clients and the capacity to support staff development. Retention of our employees therefore is critical to us, and the loss of key managerial personnel or significant revenue producers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Since late 2004 we have developed compensation programs to retain, motivate, and reward certain key employees, but we cannot be certain of our ability to retain our key employees or attract similar new employees in the future. In addition, as a result of the recent legal and regulatory matters referred to above under “Litigation-Related Risks,” as well as Marsh’s newly competitive business environment, we may lose important clients or experience difficulty in generating new business. In that event, our business or results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

Regulatory Risks

Actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.

Our activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, the European Union and the European and other countries in which our subsidiaries operate. Some of this regulation has only recently been instituted; for example, in January 2005, as part of the United Kingdom’s implementation of the EU Insurance Mediation Directive, our insurance and reinsurance services activities in the United Kingdom came under the jurisdiction of the Financial Services Authority. Many of our businesses depend on the validity of, and continued good standing under, the licenses and approvals pursuant to which they operate, as well as compliance with applicable regulations.

In all jurisdictions, applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals, and to implement regulations. Licenses may be denied or revoked for various reasons, including the violation of such regulations, conviction of crimes and similar matters. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business for specified periods of time, revocation of licenses, censures, redress to clients and fines. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations, or those generally followed by the industry, of laws or regulations, which may prove to be different from those of regulatory authorities. Accordingly, the possibility exists that we may be precluded or temporarily suspended
from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction.


We cannot be certain that our risk and insurance services, consulting and risk consulting and technology activities will continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as they have been in the past. Any significant impairment of our ability to conduct our business as we historically have done could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For further information about regulatory conditions affecting our business segments, see Item 1 (“Business”) of this report.

Risks Related to The Risk and Insurance Services Business

Volatility or declines in premiums and other trends in the insurance and reinsurance markets may significantly impede our ability to generate improved revenue growth and profitability.

MMC’s risk and insurance services segment represented 45% of our total operating segment revenue in 2006. We derive much our revenue in that segment from fees paid by clients and commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance providers. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which much of our revenues are based, and these premiums may vary widely over market cycles or across coverage types or geographic locations conditions. For example, for several years through late 2000, heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers, increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations resulted in flat or reduced premium rates (a “soft” market), which in turn put downward pressure on Marsh’s and Guy Carpenter’s commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas. The insurance industry then transitioned to a “hard”
market, in which premium rates were stable or increasing, particularly following the events of September 11

th

. Since 2004, the market has again softened in many lines and in geographic areas, although, within that general pattern, an unusually high incidence of hurricanes and other natural disasters periods has hardened the market in certain geographic areas and business lines. Because of these market fluctuations, which MMC cannot predict or control, revenues and profitability in our risk and insurance services segment may be volatile or subject to downward pressure.

In addition, we may continue to witness trends toward the development of alternative insurance markets, which deprive brokers of the opportunity to generate premium-based revenue. These trends include greater levels of self-insurance by corporations and other entities, the use of “captive” insurers and the advent of capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance needs. While Marsh and Guy Carpenter historically have been able to participate in some of these activities on behalf of their customers, and have obtained fee revenue for such services, the continuation of trends like the foregoing may impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability in our risk and insurance services segment.

Risks Related to the Consulting and Risk Consulting and Technology Businesses

In addition to engaging in the risk and insurance services industry through Marsh and Guy Carpenter, MMC participates significantly in the consulting industry and related activities. Our consulting segment, consisting of Mercer HR and Mercer Specialty, represented 35% of our total operating segment revenue in 2006 and our risk consulting and technology segment, consisting of Kroll, contributed 8%. These businesses entail their own risks.

Demand for Mercer’s and Kroll’s services may decrease for various reasons, including a general economic downturn or a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition.

We cannot be certain that demand for our consulting and risk consulting and technology services will continue to grow, or that we will compete successfully with existing or new competitors. Demand for our services also may change based on the evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients. Economic downturns affecting particular clients or industry groups could reduce demand for our services and increase price competition.


In addition, the demand for many of Mercer HR’s benefits services is affected by government regulation and taxation of employee benefits plans. This regulation and taxation drive our clients’ needs for compliance-related services. Significant changes in tax or social welfare policy or regulations

could lead some employers to discontinue their employee benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans, thereby reducing the demand for our services. A simplification of regulations or tax policy also could reduce the need for our services.

Our results may suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and suitable billing rates for our consultants.

In many cases, Mercer’s and Kroll’s clients are free to terminate our engagements at any time. If clients reduce the scope of, or terminate the use of our services with little or no notice, our consultant utilization rate might decline. In that case, we must rapidly re-deploy our consultants to other engagements in order to minimize the potential negative impact on our financial performance. Moreover, because a significant portion of our work is project-based rather than recurring in nature, our consultants’ utilization depends on our ability to continually secure additional engagements.

In addition, our profitability at Mercer and Kroll is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriate staffing costs of our personnel, we will not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer. The prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including:

clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services;

market demand for the services we provide;

our ability to develop new services and the introduction of new services by competitors;

the pricing policies of our competitors; and

general economic conditions.

If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate overall utilization as well as maintain or increase the billing rates for our consultants, our financial results could materially suffer.

Quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly in our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments.

Quarterly variations in Mercer’s and Kroll’s revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors. These include:

the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter;

the unpredictability of the timing and amount of success fees, particularly at Kroll;

the possibility that clients may decide to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as

a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress;

fluctuations in consultant hiring and utilization rates and clients’ ability to terminate

engagements without penalty;

the success of strategic acquisitions, alliances or investments; and

general economic conditions, since results of operations in our consulting businesses are

directly affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn are affected by

the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve.

In addition, a significant portion of total operating expenses at Mercer and Kroll is relatively fixed. Therefore, a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses.


Acceleration of the shift by employers from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans could adversely affect Mercer HR’s operating results.

Mercer HR currently provides clients with actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Defined benefit pension plans generally require more services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools, complex calculations to determine employer costs, funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match liabilities and assets over long periods of time. If organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate and we do not adjust our service offerings to take account of that change, Mercer HR’s operating results could be adversely affected.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

There are no unresolved comments to be reported pursuant to Item 1B.

Item 2. Properties.

MMC and its subsidiaries have major office locations in and around New York, London and Boston. We also maintain other offices around the world.

MMC and certain of its subsidiaries, including Marsh USA Inc., Mercer Human Resource Consulting, Inc. and Mercer Management Consulting, Inc., own, directly and indirectly through special-purpose subsidiaries, a 55% condominium interest covering approximately 894,000 square feet in a 44-story building in midtown Manhattan in New York City, which serves as MMC’s worldwide headquarters. MMC’s owned interest is financed by a loan that is non-recourse to MMC (except in the event of certain prohibited actions) and secured by a first mortgage lien on the condominium interests and a first priority assignment of leases and rents. In the event of a default in the payment of the loan and certain credit rating downgrade events, MMC would be obligated to pay rent for the entire occupancy of the mortgaged property. MMC leases an additional 556,000 square feet of space in its headquarters building of which 322,000 square feet has been
subleased to third parties. MMC and its subsidiaries lease an additional 673,000 square feet in various locations around New York City in support of its operations, including a lease covering approximately 420,000 rentable square feet in a building in Hoboken, New Jersey.

The principal offices of the Marsh and Mercer subsidiaries in the United Kingdom currently are located in the City of London, comprising 354,000 square feet under a long term lease. Marsh and Mercer subsidiaries lease an additional 362,000 square feet of office space in and around London in support of their operations, of which approximately 209,000 square feet are subleased to third parties.

The principal executive offices of the Putnam subsidiaries comprise approximately 300,000 square feet of leased space located in the financial district of Boston, Massachusetts. Putnam also leases approximately 656,000 square feet in various locations in the Boston area for investor services and other activities in support of its operations.

On March 18, 1999, MMC’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 40 million shares of MMC’s common stock, and on May 18, 2000 the board further authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 88 million shares. There is no expiration date specified under either of these authorizations. While MMC made no share repurchases in 2005 or in 2006, in previous years MMC has repurchased, and in the future may repurchase, shares of its common stock, on the open market or otherwise, for treasury and to meet requirements for the issuance of shares relating to MMC’s various stock compensation and benefit programs. The timing and level of MMC’s share repurchase activity may be affected by MMC’s priorities relating to the use of its cash flows for a variety of purposes. These purposes may include, in addition to share repurchases, the funding of dividends, acquisitions, investments, pension contributions and debt
reduction.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

General

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (“MMC”) is a global professional services firm. MMC’s subsidiaries include Marsh Inc. (“Marsh”), which provides risk and insurance services; Guy Carpenter & Company, LLC (“Guy Carpenter”), which provides reinsurance services; Kroll Inc. (“Kroll”), which provides risk consulting and technology services; Mercer Inc. (“Mercer”), which provides human resource and specialty consulting services; and Putnam Investments (“Putnam”), which provides investment management services. MMC’s approximately 55,000 employees worldwide provide analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in over 100 countries.

MMC operates in four principal business segments based on the services provided. Risk and Insurance Services includes risk management and insurance and reinsurance broking and services, provided primarily by Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Risk Consulting & Technology, conducted through Kroll, includes risk consulting and related investigative, intelligence, financial, security and technology services. Consulting, which comprises the activities of Mercer Human Resource Consulting and Mercer’s Specialty Consulting Businesses, includes human resource consulting and related services, and specialized management and economic consulting services. We conduct Investment Management through Putnam. Please see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, which discusses MMC’s agreement to sell Putnam to Great-West Lifeco Inc. A fuller description of our segments’ business activities is included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of segment financial results. Management evaluates performance based on segment operating income, which reflects expenses directly related to segment operations, but not MMC corporate-level expenses. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements.

This MD&A contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the outset of this report.

Significant Developments in 2006

MMC’s historical financial information should be viewed in light of the significant developments discussed below.

As described more fully below, results of operations in 2006 reflect, among other items:

stock option expense under SFAS 123(R) (“Share-Based Payment”), which MMC adopted

effective July 1, 2005. MMC’s 2006 results include stock option expense in each segment for

the full year. The 2005 results reflect a charge for six months (from the date of adoption on

July 1, 2005) recorded in corporate expenses;

restructuring savings and charges under MMC’s 2005 and 2006 restructuring plans;

the sale of Sedgwick Claims Management Services in the first quarter of 2006, the gain from

which appears in discontinued operations;

the sale of Price Forbes, MMC’s U.K.-based wholesale brokerage business in the third

quarter of 2006, the loss from which, net of current year earnings, is included in discontinued

operations;


the sale of Kroll Security International (“KSI”), Kroll’s international high-risk asset and

personal protection division in the fourth quarter of 2006, the gain from which, net of current

year operating loss, is included in discontinued operations; and

the continuing decline in market service revenues in the risk and insurance services segment.

Consolidated operating income in 2006 increased 71% to $1.5 billion, resulting from a 3% increase in operating revenue and a 2% decrease in operating expenses. Revenue increases in consulting and risk consulting & technology were partly offset by decreases in risk and insurance services and investment management. The decrease in operating expenses reflects cost savings from restructuring activities, reduced net restructuring and related charges as well as lower costs related to several significant expense items, discussed in more detail below under “Consolidated Revenue and Expense”. These expense savings were partly offset by incremental costs, primarily related to stock options under SFAS 123(R).

Results from discontinued operations in 2006 were $172 million net of tax, primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of Sedgwick Claims Management Services in January 2006. In the third quarter of 2006, MMC completed the sale of Price Forbes, its U.K.-based wholesale insurance broker. The loss on the disposal of Price Forbes and net income associated with its 2006 results are included in discontinued operations. The results of Price Forbes were insignificant to MMC’s 2005 results and, therefore, prior year amounts have not been restated. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Kroll completed the sale of Kroll Security International (“KSI”), its international high-risk asset and personal protection division. The gain on the disposal of KSI, and the financial results associated with 2006 and prior periods, are included in discontinued operations.


Consolidated Revenues and Expenses

Consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $11.9 billion, a 3% increase over the prior year. Higher revenue in the consulting and risk consulting & technology segments was partly offset by lower revenue in the risk and insurance services and investment management segments. Consolidated revenue increased 3% on an underlying basis, which includes the impact of a $71 million reduction in market services revenue.

MMC does business in over 100 countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may affect period-over-period comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by identifying these impacts. The impact of foreign currency translations, acquisitions and dispositions on MMC’s operating revenues by segment is as follows:

Revenue

In 2006, risk and insurance services revenue decreased 2% compared with 2005 and was flat on an underlying basis. A 5% increase in underlying revenue in reinsurance services was offset by a 2% decrease in insurance services, partly resulting from a $71 million decline in market service revenue. Risk consulting & technology revenue increased 12% due to growth in Kroll’s corporate advisory and restructuring, technology services and security businesses. Consulting revenue increased 11%, resulting from a 19% increase in Mercer’s specialty consulting businesses and an 8% increase in Mercer HR consulting. Investment management revenue declined 8%, primarily due to a decrease in assets under management, partly offset by higher investment gains.

During 2005, revenue in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 10% from 2004. Underlying revenue declined 11%, resulting from a $407 million decline in market services revenue, lower levels of new business and renewals and the impact of lower insurance premium rates. These declines were partly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Risk consulting & technology revenue increased $501 million. Due to the acquisition of Kroll in July 2004, results in 2005 include a full year of revenue for Kroll, compared with six months of revenue in 2004. Underlying growth in risk consulting & technology was 22%, due to growth in technology services, corporate advisory and restructuring, and background screening. Consulting revenue increased 4%, resulting from a 19% increase in Mercer’s specialty consulting businesses. Investment management revenue declined 12% as a result of the decrease in assets under management and lower investment
income.


Operating Expenses

Consolidated operating expenses in 2006 decreased 2% from 2005. The decrease in operating expenses reflects cost savings from restructuring activities; a decrease in net restructuring and related charges; lower settlement, legal and regulatory costs related to proceedings involving MMC and certain of its subsidiaries; and lower costs related to employee retention awards, partly offset by higher compensation costs, primarily in the consulting segment due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation. Expenses in 2006 also reflect lower amortization of prepaid dealer commissions and lower costs related to professional liability claims. Expenses in 2005 include a charge of $37 million for Putnam’s estimate of costs to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to Putnam by the Putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to Putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution
operations. These decreases in 2006 were partly offset by higher expenses related to stock options. Due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on July 1, 2005, the prior year includes expenses related to stock options for only six months while 2006 includes stock option expense for the full year. In 2006, the costs related to stock options are included in segment results. In 2005, the costs related to stock options are included in Corporate.

Consolidated operating expenses in 2005 decreased 4% from 2004. This was primarily due to savings from restructuring initiatives and lower regulatory and other settlement expenses, partly offset by employee retention costs, the impact of acquisitions, higher benefits costs, and incremental costs, primarily related to stock options, resulting from the implementation of SFAS 123 (R). In addition, Putnam’s expenses in 2005 include a charge of $37 million for the estimated cost necessary to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to Putnam by the Putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to Putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations. Expenses in 2004 include an $850 million charge related to the NYAG/NYSID settlement, costs of $224 million related to Putnam’s settlement and agreements with the SEC and Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and
restructuring costs of $337 million, partly offset by a $105 million credit from the final insurance settlement related to World Trade Center losses.

Restructuring and Related Activities

MMC initiated restructuring activities in the first quarter of 2005 (the “2005 Plan”) and the third quarter of 2006 (the “2006 Plan”). In 2006 we incurred net restructuring costs of $87 million and related charges of $38 million from actions taken under these restructuring plans. The costs and annualized savings relating to the plans are discussed below.

2005 Plan

MMC’s actions under the 2005 Plan are complete. MMC is currently realizing annualized savings of approximately $400 million attributable to the 2005 Plan relating primarily to the risk and insurance services segment. In early 2006, MMC began implementing its plan to eliminate excess space in its corporate headquarters building in mid-town New York (“headquarters building”). Costs related to its headquarters building incurred through June 30, 2006 (approximately $40 million) and savings generated from those actions (approximately $10 million) were recognized as part of the 2005 Plan.

2006 Plan

In September 2006, MMC announced cost savings initiatives related to firm-wide infrastructure, organization structure and operating company business processes which are expected to result in annualized savings of approximately $350 million when fully implemented by the end of 2008, and result in restructuring charges and related costs of approximately $225 million. The cost savings


initiatives are expected to be implemented in several phases – Phase 1 began in September 2006, with several additional phases to follow. The discussion below identifies the areas impacted and savings expected from various phases of the 2006 Plan.

Phase 1 of the 2006 Plan is expected to result in cost savings of $160 million. The expected savings from this phase comprise $70 million from operating company process improvements and $90 million from corporate infrastructure and process improvements in IT, real estate and corporate functions. Staff reductions of more than 750 are expected. During 2006, MMC recorded a net charge of $10 million in connection with actions taken under Phase 1 that includes a $74 million gain on the sale of five floors in MMC’s headquarters building, more than offset by costs primarily related to severance and exit costs for facilities. Through December 2006, the actions under Phase 1 are expected to result in annualized savings of approximately $110 million beginning in the first quarter of 2007. These actions under Phase 1 are expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2007, except for certain actions related to MMC’s headquarters building, discussed below.

As part of its ongoing review of operations, Marsh has identified additional actions that are expected to result in the reduction of 170 positions (“Phase 2”). These actions are expected to increase the expected annualized savings from the 2006 Plan by approximately $40 million and result in additional charges of approximately $40 million related to severance and exit costs for facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2006, MMC incurred costs of $14 million related to this second phase of the 2006 Plan.

MMC currently expects additional annualized savings of $190 million under one or more future phases of the 2006 Plan, resulting from infrastructure improvements in information technology, procurement, human resources, finance and real estate, as well as organizational structure and business process improvements. Detailed plans relating to these future phases are not yet complete, and may impact the amount of expected savings, expected costs or both that will result from these planned actions. Savings from these additional phases are expected to be realized as the actions are implemented through the end of 2008.

As noted above, MMC has been reducing its occupancy at its headquarters building in New York. Phase 1 of the 2006 Plan includes net costs of $8 million and expected annualized savings of approximately $25 million related to these actions. The expected net costs of $8 million comprise both gains on the sale of owned floors and losses on sub-leases of leased floors, which will be recognized at the earlier of when the floors are vacated or when sub-lease agreements are executed. During the fourth quarter of 2006, MMC sold its condominium interest in five floors of its headquarters building, realizing a gain of $74 million. The disposal of these floors is an integral part of MMC’s overall restructuring plan and the gain from this disposal has been included as a reduction of other operating expenses, consistent with the classification of other costs for actions taken related to this and other facilities MMC has vacated. The sale of the five floors will
reduce MMC’s annual facilities costs by approximately $5 million, which is included in the $110 million of savings from Phase 1 of the 2006 Plan, as discussed above.

MMC expects to vacate an additional seven floors, five of which it leases and expects to sub-lease and two of which it owns and expects to lease to a third party. Additional costs of $60 million are expected from these remaining actions, which are expected to generate annualized savings of $20 million when completed over the next 12-18 months.

Businesses Exited in 2006 and 2005

In December 2006, Kroll completed the sale of KSI, its international security operation that provided high-risk asset and personal protection services. The financial results of KSI are included in discontinued operations.

In the first quarter of 2006, MMC determined that Price Forbes, its U.K.-based insurance wholesale operation, met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. The 2006 results of Price Forbes, which includes a charge to reduce the carrying amount of its assets to fair value less cost to


sell, are included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income. The prior year’s amounts have not been restated because the results of Price Forbes were insignificant to MMC’s 2005 results. MMC completed the sale of Price Forbes in September 2006.

In October 2005, Marsh completed the sale of Crump Group, Inc., its U.S.-based wholesale insurance broker. The gain on the sale was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005. In December 2005 MMC agreed to sell its majority interest in Sedgwick CMS Holdings (“SCMS”). The sale of SCMS was completed on January 31, 2006, and the associated gain on the sale was recognized in the first quarter of 2006. Crump and SCMS are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.

In May 2005, MMC sold the assets of MMC Capital, which had been MMC’s private equity management subsidiary, to Stone Point Capital LLC (“Stone Point”), an entity controlled by the former managers of MMC Capital for approximately $3 million. At the time of the asset sale, Stone Point assumed responsibility for management of the Trident Funds and other private equity funds previously managed by MMC Capital. MMC does not participate in the investment decisions or management of Stone Point or the private equity funds managed by Stone Point. MMC, through its subsidiary Risk Capital Holdings, continues to own investments in firms such as Ace Ltd., XL Capital Ltd. and Axis Capital Holdings, Ltd., as well as its investments in the Trident II and other funds managed by Stone Point.

Subsequent Event

On January 31, 2007, MMC entered into a stock purchase agreement with Great-West Lifeco Inc. (“GWL”), a majority-owned subsidiary of Power Financial Corporation, pursuant to which GWL will purchase Putnam Investments Trust. The sale includes Putnam’s interest in the T.H. Lee private equity business. The after-tax cash proceeds to MMC are expected to be approximately $2.5 billion, subject to possible adjustment based on (i) changes in Putnam’s adjusted stockholders’ equity between September 30, 2006 and closing and (ii) any decline below an agreed threshold in Putnam’s adjusted asset management revenue between December 31, 2006 and closing. For further information and a copy of the stock purchase agreement, please see our Form 8-K filed on February 1, 2007. MMC expects the sale of Putnam to close in mid-2007. Putnam is classified as part of continuing operations in this annual report because the decision to sell
Putnam was not made until after December 31, 2006 and Putnam did not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation in 2006. We expect to classify Putnam as a discontinued operation in the first quarter of 2007.

Risk and Insurance Services

In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, MMC’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.

Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, since compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, compensation may be negotiated in advance on the basis of the estimated value of the services to be performed. Revenue is also affected by fluctuations in the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by increases or decreases in the value of the risks that have been insured, new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and
existing clients.


Effective October 1, 2004, Marsh eliminated contingent compensation, or market services agreements with insurers, under which it had received revenues based upon such factors as the overall volume, growth and, in some cases, profitability, of the total business placed by Marsh with a given insurer.

For billing and other administrative services, Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time.

Following the sale of MMC Capital’s business in May 2005, we no longer receive fees in connection with the private equity investments previously managed by MMC Capital, nor do we receive management fees or origination fees related to this business, except that MMC retained the right to receive certain performance fees relating to the Trident II private equity partnership. We continue to receive dividends and to recognize capital appreciation or depreciation on the investments held by Risk Capital Holdings, as well as revenue on Risk Capital Holdings’ sales of investments from time to time.

Revenue

Revenue in risk and insurance services decreased 2% in 2006 compared with 2005 and was flat on an underlying basis. Higher revenue in reinsurance services and Risk Capital Holdings was offset by a decrease in insurance services.

Underlying revenue at Marsh in 2006 was down 2% as compared to 2005. In 2006, Marsh’s new business grew 10 percent globally with solid growth in all major geographies. However, new business growth was more than offset by decreased market service revenues, which declined to $43 million in 2006 from $114 million in the prior year, and the impact of a softer pricing environment in the property and casualty insurance markets.

Effective January 1, 2007, Marsh will manage certain businesses (formerly part of Risk Consulting & Technology) which had revenue of approximately $25 million in 2006.

Reinsurance services revenue increased 5%, primarily due to new business growth. Although U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance premium rates were higher, reinsurance premium rates for most other lines were stable to down and the market environment for property catastrophe reinsurance continued to be impacted by limited reinsurer capacity and higher risk retention by clients.

Risk Capital Holdings revenue in 2006 was 2% higher compared with 2005. Higher mark-to-market gains, primarily from MMC’s investments in the Trident private equity funds were partly offset by lower realized gains from sales of directly held investments and the the elimination of investment management fees following the sale of MMC Capital’s business in May 2005. Revenue in 2006 increased 7% on an underlying basis due to higher investment gains. We expect revenues related to Risk Capital Holdings to decline in 2007.


In December 2006, MMC, through its subsidiary Risk Capital Holdings, contributed its limited partnership interest in Trident III, valued at $182 million, to the U.K. Pension Fund. The transaction was recorded at the estimated fair value of MMC’s investment on the date of the contribution. Risk Capital Holdings’ revenue in 2006 included $38 million of mark-to-market gains for Trident III recognized through the date of the contribution.

At December 31, 2006, the balance of accounts receivable related to accrued market services revenue earned prior to October 1, 2004 was approximately $43 million, compared with $132 million at December 31, 2005. MMC intends to collect the remaining MSA revenue earned prior to October 1, 2004, and is seeking to enforce its rights under the contracts to collect amounts due. However, there is no assurance that MMC will be successful in collecting all amounts due. To the extent such accrued amounts are not collected, a charge to earnings would result. In 2007, MMC collected an additional $23 million of accrued market service revenue.

Revenue in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 10% in 2005 compared with 2004, reflecting decreases in both insurance services and reinsurance services revenue. In insurance services, underlying revenue decreased 13%. Excluding the impact of decreased market services revenue, underlying revenue decreased 6%, reflecting lower new business volume and lower commercial premium rates. The decrease in underlying revenue was most significant in the United States; however, the percentage decline improved in the fourth quarter compared with earlier quarters in 2005 despite continued premium rate declines in the commercial insurance marketplace. Market services revenue declined from $521 million in 2004 to $114 million in 2005.

Expense

In 2006, expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 9% compared to the prior year. The decrease reflects cost savings from restructuring; a decrease in restructuring charges from $257 million in 2005 to $100 million in 2006; a decrease of $45 million in settlement, legal and regulatory costs related to market services agreements and associated shareholder and policyholder litigation; and a decrease of $78 million related to employee retention awards. In addition, 2006 expenses reflect lower incentive compensation costs and lower costs related to professional liability claims. Partly offsetting these decreases were costs of $47 million in 2006 related to employee stock options. The operating margin for 2006 improved to 12.4% from 5.5% in 2005.

Expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 14% in 2005, compared with the prior year. Expenses in 2004 included a $850 million charge related to the settlement with the NYAG and NYSID.

Risk Consulting & Technology

MMC’s Risk Consulting & Technology segment primarily consists of Kroll and its subsidiaries, acquired by MMC in July 2004. Kroll services fall into two major product lines: consulting services which includes risk consulting, corporate advisory & restructuring and security; and technology enabled solutions.

Kroll receives compensation primarily in the form of fees paid by clients. These fees are typically earned on an hourly, project, fixed fee or per-unit basis. Kroll’s revenue is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions. Some of Kroll’s revenue sources are counter-cyclical to the performance of the economy in general. These sources may include, for example, fees from restructuring, turnaround and forensic engagements relating to commercial bankruptcies and bond defaults. Kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures, demand for professional staff and new product development on the part of competitors, particularly in technology services.

Revenue

Risk consulting & technology revenues increased 12% in 2006 compared with 2005, 9% on an underlying basis. The technology services group, Kroll’s largest business unit, increased revenues by 12%. This unit’s Kroll OnTrack electronic discovery business responded successfully to market conditions and continued its improvement from the first quarter of 2006. The consulting services group reported double-digit growth, primarily due to strong operations performance by corporate advisory and restructuring partially due to success fees on several large engagements. Background screening was driven by strong growth in the identity theft business.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, Kroll completed the sale of KSI, its international security operation that provides high-risk asset and personal protection services. The financial results of KSI are included in discontinued operations. Effective January 1, 2007, Kroll will transfer to Marsh certain businesses which had revenue of $25 million in 2006.

The year-to-year comparisons of the segment’s revenue between 2005 and 2004 are significantly impacted by the fact that we acquired Kroll in July 2004. As a result, 2004 results include only six months of Kroll’s operations. Underlying revenue growth in 2005 was 22% due to growth in the technology services, corporate advisory and restructuring and background screening practices.

Expense

Risk consulting & technology expenses increased 11% in 2006 compared with 2005. Approximately half of the increase results from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency fluctuation. The remaining increase reflects higher compensation in the corporate advisory and restructuring and the background screening businesses, as well as increased costs for outside services in the background screening business due to a higher volume of business. Expenses in 2006 include amortization of identified intangibles of $57 million. In addition, expenses in 2006 include a credit related to the early termination of a licensing agreement.

The year-to-year comparisons of the segment’s expenses between 2005 and 2004 are significantly impacted by the fact that we acquired Kroll in July 2004. As a result, 2004 results include only six months of Kroll’s operations. Expenses include amortization of identified intangible assets of $58 million and $24 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Consulting

MMC conducts business in its Consulting segment through Mercer Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Mercer operates through two main business groups. Mercer Human Resource Consulting (“Mercer HR”) includes practice groups specializing in retirement and investments, outsourcing, health and benefits and talent. The Mercer Specialty Consulting Businesses focus on management consulting, organizational design and change management, and economic consulting.

The major component of Mercer’s revenue, in both Mercer HR and the Mercer Specialty Consulting Companies, is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer HR, principally through its health & benefits line of business, also earns significant revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts,


primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer global investment’s discretionary investment management business and certain of Mercer HR’s outsourcing business defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under administration.

Revenue in the consulting business is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of discretionary investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance.

Revenue

Consulting revenue in 2006 increased 11% compared with 2005. Revenue in Mercer HR increased 8%, or 7% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in retirement and investments, and talent. Mercer Specialty Consulting revenues grew 19%, 16% on an underlying basis. Each of the Mercer Specialty companies contributed to this performance, led by Mercer Oliver Wyman which increased underlying revenues 22%.

Consulting revenue in 2005 increased 4% compared with 2004. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 3%, due to a 18% increase in Mercer Specialty Consulting, while Mercer HR decreased 1% versus prior year. The increase in underlying revenue in Mercer Specialty reflected increases of 24% in management consulting, reflecting a 25% increase in Mercer Oliver Wyman, and 6% in economic consulting. Within Mercer HR, underlying revenue decreased 1%, reflecting a decline in the revenue associated with defined contribution plan assets previously administered by Putnam and transferred to Mercer effective January 1, 2005, increased pricing competition on traditional actuarial valuation services, and a decline in the employee benefits business transferred from Marsh to Mercer. These declines were partly offset by strong growth in talent.

Expense

Consulting expenses increased 12% in 2006 compared with 2005. The expense increase reflects restructuring charges of $27 million, the impact of acquisitions and higher compensation costs due in part to increased staff levels. In addition, expenses in 2006 include costs of $41 million related to employee stock options.

Consulting expenses increased 4% in 2005 compared with 2004. On an underlying basis, expenses increased 3%, as savings from restructuring activity and lower costs for restructuring were offset by employee retention costs, increased benefits costs and higher expenses in Specialty Consulting due to a higher volume of business.


Investment Management

MMC conducts business in its Investment Management segment through Putnam. Putnam provides investment management and related services through a broad range of investment products, including the Putnam Funds, its own family of mutual funds which are offered to individual and institutional investors. In support of the primary investment management business, Putnam subsidiaries provide other related services including transfer agency, underwriting, distribution, shareholder services, custodial, trustee and other fiduciary services. Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company (“PFTC”) serves as transfer agent, dividend disbursing agent, registrar and custodian for the Putnam Funds and provides custody services to several external clients.

On January 31, 2007, MMC entered into a stock purchase agreement with Great-West Lifeco Inc. (“GWL”), a majority-owned subsidiary of Power Financial Corporation, pursuant to which GWL will purchase Putnam Investments Trust. MMC expects the sale of Putnam to close in mid-2007. Putnam is classified as part of continuing operations in this annual report because the decision to sell Putnam was not made until after December 31, 2006 and Putnam did not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation in 2006. We expect to classify Putnam as a discontinued operation in the first quarter of 2007.

Putnam’s revenue is derived primarily from investment management and 12b-1 fees (described more fully below) received from the Putnam Funds and investment management fees for institutional accounts. Putnam also receives fees from the Putnam Funds for administrative services performed by PFTC.

Putnam companies receive fees for the investment management services provided to the Putnam Funds and institutional accounts pursuant to investment advisory contracts under which the mutual fund or institutional investor pays fees to the Putnam company that manages the fund or account. The amount of the fees varies depending on the individual mutual fund or institutional account. Fees are usually based on a sliding scale in relation to assets under management, and, in some cases are also based on investment performance. These advisory contracts generally may be terminated by either party without penalty, and contracts with the Putnam Funds must be approved annually by the fund’s shareholders or trustees, including a majority who are not affiliated with Putnam. Putnam management and the fund trustees regularly review the Putnam Fund contract fee structures in light of fund performance, the level and range of services provided, and current industry
conditions.

Investment management revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of Putnam’s assets under management. Assets under management are particularly affected by fluctuations in domestic and international stock and bond market prices, and the net level of investments and withdrawals by current and new mutual fund shareholders and institutional clients. Items affecting revenue also include, but are not limited to, actual and relative investment performance, service to clients, the development and marketing of new investment products, the relative attractiveness of Putnam’s investment styles under prevailing market conditions, changes in the investment patterns of fund shareholders and institutional clients and Putnam’s ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels.

All open-end Putnam funds other than money market funds have adopted distribution plans pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, commonly referred to as 12b-1 plans. Pursuant to these 12b-1 plans, the Putnam Funds make payments to Putnam Retail Management (“PRM”) to cover costs relating to distribution of the Putnam Funds and services provided to shareholders, at rates that differ by class of fund shares. These payments, known as Rule 12b-1 fees, enable PRM to pay service fees and other continuing compensation to firms that distribute shares of the Putnam Funds and provide services to fund shareholders. PRM retains some Rule 12b-1 fees as compensation for the costs of distribution and other services provided by Putnam and its affiliates to shareholders and for commissions advanced by Putnam at the point of sale (and recovered through fees received over time)


to firms that distribute shares of the Putnam Funds. These 12b-1 plans, and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Putnam Funds thereunder, are subject to annual renewal by the fund trustees and to termination by vote of the fund shareholders or by vote of a majority of the trustees who are not affiliated with Putnam.

PFTC receives compensation from the Putnam Funds for its administrative (transfer agency and shareholder services) and custodial services pursuant to, respectively, investor servicing agreements which may be terminated by either party on 90 days’ notice, and pursuant to written custody agreements which may be terminated by either party on 30 days’ notice. These contracts generally provide for compensation on the basis of several factors which vary with the type of service being provided. The transfer agent servicing fee received by PFTC is a fixed rate per account for retail shareholders and a fixed rate service fee based on assets under management for mutual fund defined contribution shareholders.

Revenue

Putnam’s revenue declined 8% in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a decrease in management fees resulting from a decline in average assets under management, lower 12b-1 fee revenue and lower transfer agency fees, partly offset by higher investment income. Assets under management averaged $186 billion in 2006, a 5% decline from the $196 billion managed in the same period of 2005. Assets under management aggregated $192 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in assets under management since December 31, 2005 results from a $19 billion positive impact of market and investment performance partly offset by net outflows of $16 billion. Net flows for the fourth quarter of 2006 were neutral. As of February 23, 2007, year-to-date net outflows were approximately $5 billion.

At December 31, 2006, assets held in equity securities represented 66% of assets under management compared with 68% in 2005 and 69% in 2004, while investments in fixed income products represented 34% compared with 32% in 2005 and 31% in 2004.

Putnam’s revenue decreased 12% in 2005, reflecting a decrease in fees due to a decline in assets under management, lower 12b-1 fee revenue, and decreased investment gains. Assets under management averaged $196 billion in 2005, a 10% decline from the $217 billion managed in 2004. Assets under management aggregated $189 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $213 billion at December 31, 2004. The change in assets under management from December 31, 2004 results primarily from net redemptions of $31 billion, partly offset by the positive impact of market performance.

Putnam receives service fees from the Putnam mutual funds for transfer agent, custody, and other administrative services, as contracted by the Trustees of the Putnam mutual funds. Effective January 2005, the transfer agent service fee agreement was converted to a fixed rate per retail shareholder account and a fixed rate service fee based on average assets under management for mutual fund assets in defined contribution plans. For the first six months of 2004, the transfer agent service fee agreement was based on the reimbursement of the cost of service. For the third and fourth quarters


of 2004, transfer agent service fees were based on a fixed fee and recorded as revenue. The change in the service fee agreement resulted in an increase in both service fee revenue and expense of approximately $32 million in 2005 compared with 2004.

The categories of mutual fund assets reflect style designations aligned with each fund’s prospectus.

Expense

Expenses in 2006 decreased $161 million from 2005, due to a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and the year-over-year effect of a $37 million charge in 2005 relating to costs to address issues associated with the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to Putnam by Putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to Putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations. Partly offsetting these decreases were costs of $14 million related to employee stock options.

Expenses for 2005 decreased 23% from 2004. Expenses in 2005 include a $37 million charge, described above. Expenses in 2004 include a charge of $224 million related to Putnam’s regulatory settlements with the SEC and the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on market-timing issues. Other expense reductions in 2005 include lower compensation and severance costs, reduced costs related to regulatory issues, a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and a decrease in restructuring charges. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in expenses previously borne by the funds under the prior transfer agent service agreement. Putnam’s expenses in 2004 include a $25 million credit to compensation expense associated with the settlement with Putnam’s former chief executive officer.


Corporate Items

Corporate Expenses

Corporate expenses of $137 million in 2006 were $150 million lower than in 2005. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of stock option expense, which was recorded as a corporate charge in 2005 and was charged to the business segments in 2006, and lower net restructuring charges, largely resulting from a gain on the disposal of five floors in MMC’s headquarters building, partly offset by higher professional services fees.

In 2006, MMC corporate recorded a net credit of $31 million for restructuring and related charges. A $74 million gain on the sale of five  floors in MMC’s headquarters building was partly offset by future rent on non-cancelable leases for floors vacated by MMC as well as accelerated amortization/depreciation related to floors that have been or will be vacated as part of the restructuring. The sale of these floors is an integral part of MMC’s overall restructuring plan and the gain from this disposal has been included as a reduction of other operating expense, consistent with the classification of other actions taken related to facilities MMC has vacated. In 2005, MMC corporate recorded $72 million of restructuring and related charges, primarily related to the consolidation of office space in London.

Corporate expenses were $287 million in 2005 compared to $39 million in 2004. Expenses in 2005 included $64 million of incremental expenses, primarily related to stock options, resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123 (R) effective July 1, 2005. The incremental cost related to the implementation of SFAS 123 (R) was charged to corporate and not to the operating segments in 2005. In addition, $6 million was recorded for severance and other termination benefits related to the 2005 Plan, and a charge of $49 million was recorded related to the consolidation of office space in London. Because the office consolidation was initiated by MMC to benefit its London operations as a whole, the related charge was recorded in corporate. Corporate expenses also reflected $30 million of charges in connection with the resolution of certain litigation and related matters.

Corporate expenses in 2004 included $18 million of restructuring costs, including severance and other termination benefits, future rent under non-cancelable leases and lease termination costs. The impact of the final settlement for insured losses related to the WTC reduced Corporate expenses in 2004. The replacement value of the assets exceeded their book value by $105 million which was recorded as a reduction of other operating expenses.

Interest

Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $64 million in 2006, an increase of $17 million from 2005. The increase in interest income reflected the combination of higher average corporate cash balances and generally higher average interest rates in 2006 compared with the prior year. Interest expense of $303 million in 2006 decreased from $332 million in 2005. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to $34 million recorded in the third quarter of 2005 for the prepayment charge incurred in connection with the refinancing of the mortgage on MMC’s headquarters building in New York.

Interest income was $47 million for 2005, an increase of $26 million from 2004. The increase in interest income reflected the combination of higher average corporate cash balances and generally higher average interest rates in 2005 compared with 2004. Interest expense was $332 million in 2005 compared to $219 million in 2004. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in the amount of average outstanding debt resulting from the acquisition of Kroll and a $34 million charge in 2005 for the prepayment of the $200 million mortgage on MMC’s corporate headquarters in New York. In addition, interest expense in 2005 includes a write-off of $7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to MMC’s prior revolving credit agreements which were refinanced in December 2005.


Income Taxes

MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate was 31.8% in 2006 compared to 33.7% in 2005. The change primarily reflects the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets and the resolution of tax audit issues, partly offset by an adjustment of the 2005 tax provision estimates to the tax return amount.

MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate was 33.7% in 2005, a decrease from 59.4% in 2004. The decrease in the rate was primarily due to the impact in 2004 of the non-deductibility of Putnam’s $224 million in regulatory settlements and of a lower benefit related to Marsh’s $850 million settlement of the NYAG lawsuit; partially offset in 2005 by an increase in valuation allowances provided on net operating losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions.

The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of MMC’s earnings, which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate. Furthermore, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances affecting the rate, depending on estimates of their realizability.

MMC establishes allowances for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits and litigation to the extent that such liabilities are probable and can be estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 5. Once established, allowances are evaluated based on the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue for which an allowance had previously been recorded. Such adjustments could have a material impact on MMC’s effective tax rate, net income, and cash flows in a particular future period.

2005 Stock Option Exchanges

At the May 2005 Annual Meeting, MMC’s shareholders approved a stock option exchange offer for MMC options. Under the exchange offer, eligible employees could exchange certain deeply underwater options for new options with an estimated fair value equal to 90% of the value of options surrendered in exchange, calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Effective July 1, 2005, employees elected to exchange 42 million options for 16 million new options. The exchange resulted in the retirement of 26 million options and no incremental compensation expense was incurred in connection with the new option grants. The exercise price of the new options of $27.86 is equal to the market price of MMC’s common stock as of the new grant date. The new options were unvested when granted and will vest on the later of the second anniversary of the new option grant or the vesting date of the tendered option. The other terms and conditions of the new options are
substantially similar to those of the tendered options they replaced.

On September 29, 2005, certain eligible participants in the Putnam Investments Trust Equity Partnership Plan participated in a voluntary option exchange pursuant to the terms of the Offer to Exchange Certain Outstanding Options (the “Offer to Exchange”), dated August 30, 2005. Under the Offer to Exchange, holders of options on Class B shares meeting certain eligibility requirements could elect to exchange those options for restricted shares with the equivalent value of the exchanged options, as determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. As a result of the Offer to Exchange, a total of 2,201,850 options were retired and 139,388 restricted shares were issued at a grant price of $28.26 per share.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

MMC’s routine liquidity needs are primarily for servicing debt and paying dividends on outstanding stock. Our primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from our operations.

Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities.


Operating Cash Flows

MMC generated $878 million of cash from operations in 2006 compared with $399 million in 2005. These amounts reflect the net income earned by MMC during those periods, excluding gains or losses from the disposition of businesses, the gain on the sale of five floors from the MMC headquarters building and adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. These include payments in 2006 of approximately $270 million for regulatory settlements and tax payments of $136 million related to the disposition of businesses. Cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows.

In January 2005 MMC reached a settlement with the NYAG and NYSID that resolved the actions commenced by them against MMC and Marsh. As a result of this agreement, MMC recorded a charge in 2004 for an $850 million policyholder fund. MMC paid the first $255 million to the fund on June 1, 2005. An additional $255 million was paid on June 1, 2006, and $170 million will be paid to the fund on or before each of June 1, 2007 and 2008, respectively. These amounts are included in Regulatory settlements in the consolidated balance sheets.

MMC has funding requirements for the U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans in 2007 of approximately $19 million and $176 million, respectively. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign law. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan in 2006 or in 2007. Funding requirements for non-U.S. plans vary country by country. Contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of MMC’s cash flows, including dividends, investments, and
share repurchases.

During 2006, MMC contributed approximately $20 million to the U.S. pension plans and $319 million to the significant non-U.S. pension plans, compared with $229 million for U.S. plans and $498 million for significant non-U.S. plans in 2005. The contribution to the non-U.S. plans in 2006 includes a non-cash contribution of MMC’s investment in Trident III, a private equity limited partnership. The contribution was recorded based on the estimated fair value on the date of the contribution of $182 million.

Financing Cash Flows

Net cash used for financing activities was $759 million in 2006 compared with $128 million of net cash provided by financing activities in 2005. During 2006, MMC reduced outstanding debt by approximately $570 million.

In December 2005, MMC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new $1.2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. Subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by MMC. The facility, which will expire in December 2010, replaced MMC’s $1.0 billion and $700 million revolving credit facilities which were scheduled to expire in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In December 2005, certain of MMC’s foreign subsidiaries borrowed approximately $510 million under the new facility, primarily to fund the repatriation of accumulated earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. There was $94 million outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2006.

In September 2005, MMC issued $550 million of 5.15% senior notes due 2010 and $750 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2015 (the “2005 Notes”). The net proceeds from the 2005 Notes were used to pay down the $1.3 billion term loan facility established in late 2004.


Also in September 2005, MMC refinanced its headquarters building in New York City by entering into a 30-year, $475 million mortgage loan agreement at a fixed annual rate of 5.7%. This replaced the existing $200 million, 9.8% mortgage due in 2009. The incremental proceeds, net of a $34 million prepayment charge, were used to pay down outstanding short-term debt.

MMC’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB by Standard & Poor’s. MMC’s short-term debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-2 by Standard & Poor’s. MMC carries a negative outlook from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.

MMC paid total dividends of $374 million in 2006 ($0.68 per share) and $363 million ($0.68 per share) in 2005. MMC made no share repurchases in 2006.

In January 2007, MMC announced that its board of directors had approved an increase to MMC’s quarterly cash dividend to 19 cents per share from 17 cents previously.

MMC also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $270 million at December 31, 2006 and $354 million at December 31, 2005. There was $8 million outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2006.

Investing Cash Flows

Net cash used for investing activities amounted to $136 million in 2006 compared with $153 million of net cash provided by investing activities in 2005. Cash generated by the sale of SCMS totaled $326 million in 2006, which was partly offset by net purchases of long term investments. Cash used for acquisitions totaled $221 million in 2006 versus $74 million in 2005. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $75 million related to acquisitions completed in 2006 and prior years are recorded in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006. Proceeds from sales related to fixed assets and capitalized software includes $125 million of proceeds related to the sale of the floors from the MMC headquarters building. In addition, cash used to purchase investments of $193 million was partly offset by the sale of securities of $118 million in 2006. In 2005, cash generated by the sale of
securities totaled $333 million.

MMC expects the after tax proceeds from the anticipated sale of Putnam in mid-2007 to approach $2.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments in the sale agreement. MMC will analyze various alternatives for use of the expected proceeds including acquisitions, adjustments to our capital structure, such as debt repayment and/or share repurchases, and investments in our existing businesses.

MMC’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $307 million in 2006 and $345 million in 2005, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs.

MMC has committed to potential future investments of approximately $222 million in connection with various private equity funds and other MMC investments. The commitment comprises $82 million related to Trident II and other funds managed by Stone Point and $140 million related to possible investments by Putnam. At December 31, 2006, MMC has no future commitments related to Trident III, as those commitments were assumed by MMC’s U.K. pension plan when the investment in Trident III was contributed to the plan in December 2006. The majority of MMC’s other investment commitments for funds managed by Stone Point are related to Trident II, the investment period for which is now closed for new investments. Any remaining capital calls for Trident II would relate to follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses. Significant future capital calls related to Trident II are not expected. Although it is
anticipated that Trident II will be harvesting its remaining portfolio in 2007 and thereafter, the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by MMC.


Putnam has investment commitments of $140 million for three active Thomas H. Lee (“THL”) funds, of which Putnam believes approximately $42 million will not be called. Putnam is authorized to commit to invest up to $187 million in future THL investment funds, but is not required to do so. At December 31, 2006 none of that additional $187 million is committed. These commitments will remain with Putnam when the anticipated sale of Putnam closes.

Approximately $37 million was invested in 2006 related to all of the commitments discussed above (including investments in Trident III prior to its contribution to MMC’s U.K. pension plan).

Market Risk

Certain of MMC’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.

Interest Rate Risk

MMC manages its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance MMC’s asset base. MMC uses interest rate swaps on a limited basis to manage exposure to interest rate movements on its cash and investments as well as interest expense on borrowings. Rate swaps are only executed with highly creditworthy counterparties.

MMC had the following investments and debt instruments subject to variable interest rates:

Cash and cash equivalents invested

in certificates of deposit and time deposits (Note 1)

$

2,089

Fiduciary cash and investments (Note 1)

$

3,704

Variable rate debt outstanding (Note 11)

$


These investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in the above-indicated notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increase by 10% or 48 basis points over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase by approximately $15 million. However, this would be partially offset by a $2 million increase in interest expense resulting in a net increase to income before income taxes and minority interest of $13 million.


Foreign Currency Risk

The translated values of revenue and expense from MMC’s international risk and insurance services and consulting operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business.

Equity Price Risk

MMC holds investments in public and private companies, as well as in certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point. Publicly traded investments of $124 million are classified as available for sale under SFAS No. 115. Non-publicly traded investments of $75 million are accounted for using the cost method and $366 million are accounted for using the equity method under APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock”. Changes in value of trading securities are recognized in income when they occur. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate
under the applicable accounting pronouncements.

Other

A significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding MMC’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Legal and Other Loss Contingencies

MMC and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings. GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance. MMC analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability.

In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are expected under MMC’s various insurance programs.

Retirement Benefits

MMC maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its U.S. and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible non-U.S. employees. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires that MMC


recognize the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans (the “Plans”) as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in MMC’s balance sheet. MMC adopted the provisions of SFAS 158, prospectively, on December 31, 2006.

The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. MMC believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, MMC expects pension expense to decrease by approximately $53 million in 2007 and currently expects to contribute approximately $195 million to the plans during 2007.

During 2005 MMC made changes to the U.S. pension plan that were designed to reduce MMC’s benefits costs going forward. The changes, which were effective January 1, 2006, include changing the benefit formula from a final average salary to a career average salary as well as a change in the calculation for early retirement benefits. During 2006, MMC made similar changes to its U.K. pension plans.

Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 84% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows:

Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are correlated with the discount rate.

MMC contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the United States is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by MMC as incurred. This postretirement liability is included in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes

MMC’s tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Tax allowances are established when, despite the belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable, there is the potential that they may be successfully challenged. These allowances, as well as the related interest, are adjusted to reflect changing facts and circumstances.


Tax law requires items be included in MMC’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized
in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements.

As discussed below, under New Accounting Pronouncements, MMC’s accounting for income taxes will be impacted by the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48.

Share-based Payment

Effective July 1, 2005, MMC adopted SFAS 123(R) “Share-based Payment”, which requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by SFAS 123(R).

As of December 31, 2006, there was $84 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s option awards and $15 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to Putnam’s option awards. The weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized are 1.4 years for MMC and 1.7 years for Putnam. Also as of December 31, 2006, there was $203 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards and $94 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to Putnam’s restricted stock awards.

See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of SFAS 123(R).

Investment Valuation

MMC holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point and T.H. Lee. The majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities under SFAS No. 115. Where applicable, certain investments are accounted for under APB Opinion No. 18. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. MMC bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. Fair value of private equity investments is determined by the Funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of
comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for equity holdings in private companies, or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of MMC’s investments. MMC reviews the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments with the fund manager.


New Accounting Pronouncements

New accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 to MMC’s consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158 which requires that MMC recognize the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans (the “Plans”) as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of AOCI, net of tax, in MMC’s balance sheet. MMC adopted the provisions of SFAS 158, prospectively, on December 31, 2006. The impact of adopting SFAS 158 caused a reduction in assets of $660 million and an increase in liabilities of $245 million, including a related adjustment to tax benefits of $423 million. The net impact of adopting SFAS 158 was a reduction of MMC’s stockholders’ equity of $905 million, $804 million including an adjustment for the impact of recording a minimum pension credit prior to
the adoption of SFAS 158. This adoption has no impact on MMC’s consolidated statements of income or cash flows. The adoption of SFAS 158 does not impact any financial covenants in MMC’s bank agreements, nor does MMC expect adoption to adversely impact its credit ratings. SFAS 158 also requires companies to measure the funded status of their plans as of their year-end balance sheet date no later than 2008. MMC’s existing policy is to measure the funded status of its Plans as of its year-end balance sheet date and therefore is not impacted by this requirement.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS 157 are effective as of the beginning of MMC’s 2008 fiscal year. MMC is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. This interpretation requires that MMC recognize in its consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The provisions of FIN 48 will be effective for MMC beginning in the first quarter of 2007, with the cumulative effect of any change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. On February 27, 2007 the FASB issued draft implementation
guidance in the form of a proposed FASB Staff Position subject to a thirty day comment period. Pending finalization of this guidance, MMC is evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements.

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations:

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (“MMC”), a global professional services firm, is organized based on the different services that it offers. Under this organizational structure, MMC operates in four principal business segments: risk and insurance services, risk consulting & technology, consulting and investment management.

As discussed in Note 5, MMC disposed of several businesses in 2006 and 2005, which are classified as discontinued operations in these financial statements.

The risk and insurance services segment provides risk management and insurance broking, reinsurance broking and insurance program management services for businesses, public entities, insurance companies, associations, professional services organizations, and private clients. Prior to the sale of MMC Capital’s business to Stone Point Capital, LLC (“Stone Point”) on May 31, 2005, the risk and insurance services segment also provided services principally in connection with originating, structuring and managing investments, primarily in the insurance and financial services industries. MMC no longer participates in the investment decisions or management of Stone Point or the Trident funds. However, MMC continues to own investments in the funds managed by Stone Point and directly owns investments in certain insurance and financial services entities through its subsidiary Marsh and McLennan Risk Capital Holdings (“Risk Capital Holdings”).

The risk consulting & technology segment provides various risk consulting and related risk mitigation services to corporate, government, institutional and individual clients. These services fall into two main business groups: consulting, which includes corporate advisory & restructuring services, consulting services and security services; and technology-enabled solutions.

The consulting segment provides advice and services to the managements of organizations in the areas of Human Resource Consulting, comprising retirement and investments, health & benefits, outsourcing and talent; and Specialty Consulting, comprising management consulting, organization design and change management, and economic consulting.

The investment management segment primarily provides securities investment advisory distribution and administrative services for institutional accounts and a group of publicly held investment companies.

As discussed in Note 18, on February 1, 2007 MMC announced an agreement to sell Putnam, which comprises its entire investment management segment.

Principles of Consolidation:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities:

In its capacity as an insurance broker or agent, MMC collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. MMC also collects claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds.

Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held in a fiduciary capacity. Interest income on these fiduciary funds, included in service revenue, amounted to $180 million in 2006, $151 million in 2005, and $130 million in 2004. Since fiduciary assets are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. At December 31, 2006, Putnam managed the investment of approximately $1.4 billion of the fiduciary assets.


Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables were $8.7 billion and $10.4 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. MMC is not a principal to the contracts under which the right to receive premiums or the right to receive reimbursement of insured losses arises. Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables are, therefore, not assets and liabilities of MMC and are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In certain instances, MMC advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. These advances are made from corporate funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as receivables.

Revenue:

Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services rendered, interest income on certain fiduciary funds and market service fees from insurers earned on placements made prior to October 2004. Effective October 1, 2004 Marsh agreed to eliminate contingent compensation agreements with insurers. Insurance commissions and fees for risk transfer services generally are recorded as of the effective date of the applicable policies or, in certain cases (primarily in MMC’s reinsurance operations), as of the effective date or billing date, whichever is later. Commissions are net of policy cancellation reserves, which are estimated based on historic and current data on cancellations. Fees for non-risk transfer services provided to clients are recognized over the period in which the services are provided, using a proportional performance model. Fees resulting from achievement of
certain performance thresholds are recorded when such levels are attained and such fees are not subject to forfeiture. Prior to 2006, revenue also includes compensation for services provided in connection with the organization, structuring and management of insurance, financial and other industry-focused investments, as well as appreciation or depreciation that has been recognized on holdings in such investments. MMC no longer receives management fees or origination fees related to Stone Point’s business, except that MMC retained the right to receive certain performance fees related to the Trident II private equity partnership. MMC will continue to receive dividends and to recognize capital appreciation or depreciation on its investment holdings. In addition, Crump Group, Inc. and Sedgwick CMS Holdings and Price Forbes, which were previously part of this segment, are classified as discontinued operations.

Risk Consulting & Technology compensation consists of fees paid by clients. Such fees are typically charged on an hourly, project, or fixed fee basis, and sometimes on a per service or per unit basis. Revenue is recognized as the services are performed pursuant to the applicable contractual arrangements. Revenue related to time and materials arrangements is recognized in the period in which the services are performed. Revenue from hourly or daily rate engagements is recognized as hours are expended at the agreed-upon billing amounts. Revenue related to fixed price arrangements is recognized based upon a proportional performance model. Revenue provided from credit services is recognized when the information is delivered to the customer, either electronically or by other means. The impact of any revisions in estimated total revenue and direct contract costs is recognized in the period in which they become known. Expenses incurred by professional staff in
the generation of revenue are billed to the client and included in revenue. Kroll records either billed or unbilled accounts receivable based on case-by-case invoicing determinations. Software revenue is recognized when the product is shipped, with the exception of royalty-based products, for which revenue is recognized as applicable royalty reports are received. Software revenue is recorded net of estimated customer returns and allowances. Contingent fees are recognized as earned and upon satisfaction of all conditions to their payment. Kroll Security International, which was previously part of this segment, is classified as a discontinued operation.

Consulting revenue includes fees paid by clients for advice and services and commissions from insurance companies for the placement of individual and group contracts. Fee revenue for engagements where Mercer is remunerated based on time plus out-of-pocket expenses is recognized based on the amount of time consulting professionals expend on the engagement. For fixed fee engagements, revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model. Revenue from insurance commissions not subject to a fee arrangement is recorded over the effective period of the applicable policies. Revenues for asset based fees are recognized on an accrual basis by applying the daily/monthly rate as contractually agreed with the client to the net asset value.


Investment Management revenue is derived primarily from investment management fees and 12b-1 fees. Investment management fees are recognized as services are provided. Such fees are based on the net assets of the funds and are collected directly from the applicable funds. Mutual fund distribution fees are recognized over the period in which the fees can be charged to the related funds, or when a contingent deferred sales charge is triggered by a redemption. Sales of mutual fund shares are recorded on a settlement date basis and commissions thereon are recorded on a trade date basis. Fees resulting from achievement of specified performance thresholds are recorded when such levels are attained and such fees are not subject to forfeiture.

MMC has deferred the recognition of performance fee revenue in connection with the management of certain private equity funds of $172 million at December 31, 2006. This revenue is based on the investment performance over the life of each private equity fund, and future underperformance may result in the forfeiture of such revenue. As noted above, MMC only recognizes performance fee revenue when such fees are no longer subject to forfeiture, which for the $172 million noted above, may take a number of years to resolve.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of certificates of deposit and time deposits, generally with original maturities of three months or less.

Fixed Assets:

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

Depreciation of buildings, building improvements, furniture, and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods covered by the applicable leases or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is less. MMC periodically reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable.

The components of fixed assets are as follows:

Investment Securities:

MMC holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain private equity funds (managed by Stone Point and T.H. Lee) and seed shares for mutual funds. Publicly traded investments are classified as available for sale or trading securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”), and carried at market value. Non-publicly traded investments are carried at cost in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18 (“APB 18”). Changes in the fair value of trading securities are recorded in earnings when they occur. Changes in the fair value of available for sale securities are recorded in stockholders’ equity, net of applicable taxes, until realized. Securities classified as trading or available for sale under SFAS 115, or carried at cost under APB 18, are included in Long-term
investments in the consolidated balance sheets.


Certain investments, primarily investments in private equity funds, are accounted for using the equity method under APB 18. The underlying private equity funds follow investment company accounting, where securities within the fund are carried at fair value. MMC records its proportionate share of the change in fair value of the funds in earnings. Securities recorded using the equity method are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Gains or losses recognized in earnings from the investment securities described above are included in Investment income (loss) in the consolidated statements of income. Costs related to management of MMC’s investments, including incentive compensation partially derived from investment income and loss, are recorded in operating expenses.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:

Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. MMC performs an annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. Other intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their estimated lives and reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature.

Capitalized Software Costs:

MMC capitalizes certain costs to develop, purchase, or modify software for the internal use of MMC. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from three to ten years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to updates and enhancements are only capitalized if they will result in additional functionality. Computer software costs of $270 million and $284 million, net of accumulated amortization of $663 million and $524 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Legal and Other Loss Contingencies:

MMC and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings. MMC records liabilities for contingencies including legal costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. To the extent such losses can be recovered under MMC’s insurance programs, estimated recoveries are recorded when losses for insured events are recognized.

Significant management judgment is required to estimate the amounts of such contingent liabilities and the related insurance recoveries. MMC analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. Contingent liabilities are not discounted.

Income Taxes:

MMC’s tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Tax allowances are established for uncertain tax positions when, despite the belief that the tax return positions are consistent with applicable law, there is the potential that they may be successfully challenged. The allowances, are established for all identified liabilities and related interest, that are probable and can be estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 5. The possibility that a taxing authority may not assert an issue is not taken into account. It is assumed that the taxing authority will become fully aware of all facts relating to an issue and propose adjustments as appropriate. Allowances are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each
reporting period. Allowances for issues that have been asserted by tax authorities and resolved by agreement are adjusted in the quarter when agreement is reached. If the statute of limitations operates to bar assessment of an issue that has not been asserted by a taxing authority, the related allowance is reversed at that time.


Tax law requires items to be included in MMC’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the consolidated statements of income. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent
tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements.

U.S. Federal income taxes are provided on unremitted foreign earnings except those that are considered permanently reinvested, which at December 31, 2006 amounted to approximately $1.6 billion. However, if these earnings were not considered permanently reinvested, the incremental tax liability which otherwise might be due upon distribution, net of foreign tax credits, would be approximately $70 million.

Derivative Instruments:

All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

Variable Interest Entities:

Through Putnam, MMC manages $4.8 billion in the form of Collateralized Debt Obligations (“CDOs”), Collateralized Bond Obligations (“CBOs”) and Collateralized Loan Obligations (“CLOs”). Separate limited liability companies were established to issue the notes evidencing these obligations and to hold the underlying collateral, which consists of high-yield bonds and other securities. Putnam serves as the collateral manager for the CDOs, CBOs and CLOs. The maximum loss exposure related to the CDOs, CBOs and CLOs is limited to Putnam’s investment totaling $4.6 million in certain of these CDOs and CLOs reflected in Long-term investments in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006. MMC has concluded it is not the primary beneficiary of these entities under FIN 46(R) “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.”

Concentrations of Credit Risk:

Financial instruments which potentially subject MMC to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, commissions and fees receivable and insurance recoverables. MMC maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places its investments in an extensive number of high quality financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which MMC does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas.

Per Share Data:

Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of MMC’s common stock outstanding, excluding unvested restricted stock. Diluted net income per share is calculated by reducing net income for the potential minority interest expense associated with unvested shares under the Putnam Equity Partnership Plan, discussed further in Note 9, and adding back dividend equivalent expense related to common stock equivalents, to the extent recognized in earnings. This result is then divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding, which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares. The following reconciles income from continuing operations to income from continuing operations for diluted earnings per share and basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares
outstanding:

Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may vary from those estimates.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158,

“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R)” (“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires that MMC recognize the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans (the “Plans”) as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in MMC’s balance sheet. MMC adopted the provisions of SFAS 158, prospectively, on December 31,
2006. The impact of adopting SFAS 158 caused a reduction in assets of $660 million and an increase in liabilities of $245 million, including a related adjustment to tax benefits of $423 million. The net impact of adopting SFAS 158 was a reduction to MMC’s stockholders’ equity of $905 million, $804 million including the impact of recording a minimum pension credit prior to the adoption of SFAS 158. SFAS 158 also requires companies to measure the funded status of their plans as of their year-end balance sheet date no later than 2008. MMC’s existing policy is to measure the funded status of its Plans as of its year-end balance sheet date and therefore, MMC is not impacted by this requirement.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS 157 are effective as of the beginning of MMC’s 2008 fiscal year. MMC is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. This interpretation requires that MMC recognize in its consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The provisions of FIN 48 will be effective for MMC beginning in the first quarter of 2007, with the cumulative effect of any change in


accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. On February 27, 2007 the FASB issued draft implementation guidance in the form of a proposed FASB Staff Position subject to a thirty day comment period. Pending finalization of this guidance, MMC is evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and

Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS 159 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to conform with current year presentation, in particular with regard to discontinued operations classification for Kroll Security International and certain balance sheet line items.

4. Acquisitions and Dispositions

During 2006, MMC made 16 acquisitions, for total purchase consideration of $200 million. The allocation of purchase consideration resulted in acquired goodwill of $132 million as of December 31, 2006. Estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to adjustment when purchase accounting is finalized.

In December 2006, MMC sold its interest in Kroll Security International, which provided high risk asset and personal protection services. The gain on sale is included in discontinued operations.

In September 2006, MMC sold the assets of Price Forbes, its U.K.-based insurance wholesale operation. The loss on the sale, which included a charge in the first quarter of 2006 to reduce the carrying amount of its assets to fair value, is included in discontinued operations.

In January 2006, MMC sold its majority interest in Sedgwick CMS Holdings (“SCMS”), a provider of claims management and associated productivity services. The gain on sale, including the gain on MMC’s indirect investment in SCMS through the Trident II private equity fund, is included in discontinued operations.

During 2005, MMC made nine acquisitions, for total purchase consideration of $68 million. The allocation of purchase consideration resulted in acquired goodwill of $45 million during 2005.

In May 2005, MMC sold the assets of MMC Capital, its private equity manager, to Stone Point Capital LLC, a company controlled by the former managers of MMC Capital, for approximately $3 million. Stone Point has assumed responsibility for management of the Trident Funds and other private equity funds previously managed by MMC Capital. MMC does not participate in the investment decisions or management of Stone Point or the private equity funds managed by Stone Point. MMC continues to


own direct investments in insurance and financial services companies, including Ace Ltd., XL Capital Ltd. and Axis Capital Holdings Ltd., as well as its investments in Trident II and other funds managed by Stone Point.

5. Discontinued Operations

In the fourth quarter of 2006, Kroll completed the sale of Kroll Security International (“KSI”), its international high-risk asset and personal protection division. The gain on the disposal of KSI and the financial results associated with 2006 and prior periods are included in discontinued operations.

In the first quarter of 2006, MMC determined that Price Forbes, its U.K.-based insurance wholesale operation, met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. The 2006 results of Price Forbes, which include a charge to reduce the carrying amount of its assets to fair value less cost to sell, are included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income. The results of Price Forbes were insignificant to MMC’s 2005 results and therefore, prior year amounts have not been restated. MMC completed the sale of Price Forbes in September 2006.

MMC sold Crump Group, Inc., its U.S.-based wholesale insurance broker, during the fourth quarter of 2005, and its majority interest in SCMS, a provider of claims management and associated productivity services, on January 31, 2006. The account balances and activities of these entities are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

All of the entities classified as discontinued operations were part of MMC’s risk and insurance services segment, except KSI, which was part of MMC’s risk consulting & technology segment.

6. Goodwill and Other Intangibles

MMC is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. MMC performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. MMC completed its annual impairment tests in the third quarter of 2006 and determined that such assets were not impaired.

Reversals of valuation allowances recorded in prior years reduced the tax provision by $29 million in 2006. The valuation allowances had a net decrease of $61 million in 2006 compared with a net increase of $26 million in 2005. Approximately $1 million of the cumulative valuation allowances relates to amounts which if realized would reduce goodwill or increase contributed capital in the future. Approximately 50% of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards expire over various periods from 2007 through 2025, and others are unlimited. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. MMC evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income, in assessing the need for
a valuation allowance. The underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company’s recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, MMC believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowances at December 31, 2006. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.

The American Jobs Creation Act (the “Act”), adopted on October 22, 2004, provided for a special one-time tax deduction, or dividend received deduction, of 85% of qualifying foreign earnings that are repatriated in either a company’s last tax year that began before the enactment date or the first tax year that begins during the one-year period beginning on the enactment date. In the fourth quarter of 2005, MMC recorded an income tax benefit of $8 million, attributable to the repatriation of approximately $585 million of qualifying earnings under the provisions of the Act. The $8 million tax benefit resulted from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities previously provided under SFAS No. 109, which were in excess of the tax liabilities from repatriation of these qualifying earnings.


MMC is routinely examined by the Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in the United Kingdom, as well as states in which it has significant business operations, such as California, Massachusetts and New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. MMC regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from examinations. MMC has established tax allowances which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. MMC believes the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of MMC, although a resolution could have a material impact on MMC’s net income or cash flows and on its effective tax rate in a particular future period.

8. Retirement Benefits

MMC maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible non-U.S. employees. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign law.

Implementation of SFAS 158

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158 which requires that MMC recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans (the “Plans”) as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The offsetting adjustment to the amount of assets and liabilities required to be recognized is recorded in AOCI, net of tax, in MMC’s 2006 year-end balance sheet. Subsequent changes in the funded status will be recognized through the income statement and other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur as appropriate. The incremental effect of applying SFAS 158 on individual line items in MMC’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 including tax effects is as follows:

The long-term rate of return assumption is selected for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets. MMC uses Mercer actuaries to perform the valuations of its pension plans. MMC utilizes a model developed by its actuaries to assist in the setting of this assumption. The model takes into account several factors, including: actual and target portfolio allocation; investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust; historical portfolio performance; relevant forward-looking economic analysis; and expected returns, variances, and correlations for different asset classes. All returns utilized and produced by the model are geometric averages. These measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio. MMC generally does not adjust the rate of
return assumption from year to year if, at the measurement date, it is within the best estimate range, defined as between the 25th and 75th percentile of the expected long-term annual returns in accordance with the “American Academy of Actuaries Pension Practice Council Note May 2001 Selecting and Documenting Investment Return Assumptions” and consistent with Actuarial Standards of Practice No. 27. The historical five- and ten-year average asset returns of each plan are also reviewed to ensure they are consistent and reasonable compared with the best estimate range. The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the assumed long-term rate of return to the market-related value of plan assets as defined by SFAS No. 87. This market-related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets
and the actual return based on the market value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future market-related value of the assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded.

The target asset allocation for the U.S. plans is 70% equities and 30% fixed income, and for the U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 84% of non-U.S. plan assets, is 58% equities and 42% fixed income. As of the measurement date, the actual allocation of assets for the U.S. plan was 74% to equities and 26% to fixed income, and for the U.K. plans was 62% to equities and 38% to fixed income. The assets of the Company’s defined benefit plans are well-diversified and are managed in accordance with applicable laws and with the goal of maximizing the plans’ real return within acceptable risk parameters. MMC uses threshold-based portfolio rebalancing to ensure the actual portfolio remains consistent with target allocations.

The discount rate selected for each U.S. plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are based on appropriate bond indices such as the iBoxx £ Corporates 15-year index in the U.K. Projected compensation increases reflect current expectations as to future levels of inflation.

In September 2005, the Company contributed 8 million shares of MMC common stock, valued at $205 million, to the U.S. qualified plan. Prior to this contribution, the U.S. qualified plan held no MMC securities. Plan assets of approximately $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were managed by Putnam, which includes both separately managed and publicly available investment funds.


The assets and liabilities of the U.S. defined benefit pension plans were re-measured at October 31, 2005 to reflect a change in substantive plan as defined by SFAS No. 87, “Employer’s Accounting for Pensions” (“SFAS 87”). The changes include changing the benefit formula from a final average salary to a career average salary as well as a change in the calculation for early retirement benefits. The change in substantive plans reduced the projected benefit obligation by approximately $138 million.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $337 million, $322 million and $0, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and $326 million, $315 million and $0, respectively, as of December 31, 2005.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 became law. The net periodic benefit cost for 2006 and 2005 shown above includes the subsidy.

The assumed health care cost trend rate for Medicare eligibles was approximately 11.5% in 2006, gradually declining to 5% in 2019, and the rate for non-Medicare eligibles was 10% in 2006, gradually declining to 5% in 2016. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the U.S. health care plans.

In December 2006, MMC contributed its limited partnership interest in Trident III, valued at $182 million to its pension plan in the United Kingdom.

The assets and liabilities of the U.K. defined benefit pension plan were re-measured at March 31, 2005 to reflect a plan curtailment as defined by SFAS No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits.” Restructuring activities led to a reduction in force which resulted in the elimination of the accrual for defined benefits for a significant number of employees.


The non-U.S. defined benefit plans do not have any direct or indirect ownership of MMC stock.

The benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $3.6 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and $3.5 billion, $3.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2005.

The components of the net periodic benefit cost for the non-U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans and the curtailment, settlement and termination expenses under SFAS 88 are as follows:

Contribution Plans

MMC maintains certain defined contribution plans for its employees, including the Marsh & McLennan Companies Stock Investment Plan (“SIP”) and the Putnam Investments, LLC Profit Sharing Retirement Plan (the “Putnam Plan”) that are qualified under U.S. tax law. Under these plans, eligible employees may contribute a percentage of their base salary, subject to certain limitations. For the SIP, MMC matches a fixed portion of the employees’ contributions and may also make additional discretionary contributions, while under the Putnam Plan the contributions are at the discretion of MMC subject to


IRS limitations. The SIP contains an Employee Stock Ownership Plan under U.S. tax law and plan assets of approximately $483 million at December 31, 2006 and $572 million at December 31, 2005 were invested in MMC stock. Effective October 25, 2004, all participants became eligible to direct their Company matching contributions and all of their employee contribution account balances to any of the available investment options. If a participant does not choose an investment direction for his or her future Company matching contributions, they are automatically invested in the Putnam Fixed Income Fund. SIP plan assets of approximately $1,052 million and $1,028 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were managed by Putnam. The cost of these defined contribution plans was $70 million, $90 million, and $97 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

9. Stock Benefit Plans

MMC maintains multiple share-based payment arrangements under which employees are awarded grants of restricted stock, stock options and other forms of stock-based payment arrangements. Prior to July 1, 2005, MMC accounted for these awards under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”), as permitted under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”). Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options was not recognized as long as the stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market price of MMC’s common stock on the date of grant, the effect of forfeitures on restricted stock, restricted stock units and deferred stock units was recognized when such forfeitures occurred and dividend equivalents on restricted stock units and deferred stock units were expensed in the period
incurred. In addition, MMC’s stock purchase plan was not considered compensatory under APB 25, therefore, no expense was required to be recognized. Effective July 1, 2005, MMC adopted the recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123 (R)”), using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost recognized beginning July 1, 2005 includes compensation cost for all share-based payment arrangements granted prior to but not yet vested as of July 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value and expense attribution methodology determined in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and compensation cost for all share-based payment arrangements granted subsequent to June 30, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value and expense attribution methodology determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 (R). In addition, MMC’s stock purchase plan was considered
compensatory during the third quarter of 2005, the effect of forfeitures on restricted stock, restricted stock units and deferred stock units is required to be estimated when recognizing compensation cost and dividend equivalents on restricted stock units and deferred stock units expected to vest are required to be classified as dividends. Results for periods prior to July 1, 2005 have not been restated.

As a result of adopting SFAS 123 (R) on July 1, 2005, MMC’s income before income taxes and minority interest for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 is $116 million and $64 million lower, respectively, than if it had continued to account for share-based payment arrangements under APB 25 ($78 million after-tax, or $0.14 per share and $44 million after-tax, or $0.08 per share for the 2006 and 2005 periods, respectively). The cumulative effect of the change in accounting upon adoption of SFAS 123 (R) on July 1, 2005 was not material.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123 (R), restricted stock units and deferred stock units were classified as liabilities and measured at their respective grant date fair values. Prepaid compensation cost was recognized for the unearned portion of such awards. Upon implementation of SFAS 123 (R), such awards were adjusted to their respective accrued grant date fair values totaling approximately $110 million and were reclassified to equity.

Effective October 1, 2005, certain features in the MMC stock purchase plan were changed so that shares of MMC common stock will be purchased at a price that is 95% of the average market price of the stock on each quarterly purchase date. In accordance with SFAS 123 (R), the stock purchase plan is no longer compensatory beginning October 1, 2005.


If compensation cost for all MMC’s share-based payment arrangements had been recognized based on the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123 for the periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123 (R) on July 1, 2005, MMC’s net income and net income per share in 2005 and 2004 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the table below.

The pro forma information reflected above includes stock options issued under MMC’s incentive and stock award plans and the Putnam Investments Equity Partnership Plan and stock issued under MMC’s stock purchase plan. In addition, the pro forma information reflected above is based on recognizing the costs of employee stock option awards granted prior to July 1, 2005 to retiree-eligible individuals over the full vesting term of the award. Effective July 1, 2005, MMC began recognizing new employee stock option awards granted to retiree-eligible individuals over a shorter period, consistent with the retirement vesting acceleration provisions of these grants. If the costs of employee stock option awards granted prior to July 1, 2005 to retiree-eligible individuals had been recognized for these individuals under this accelerated method, pro forma net income for the years ended 2005 and 2004 would have amounted to $340 million and $44
million.

MMC Incentive and Stock Award Plans

In 2000, the Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. 2000 Employee Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the “2000 Employee Plan”) and the Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. 2000 Senior Executive Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the “2000 Executive Plan”) were adopted. The types of awards permitted under these plans include stock options, restricted stock, stock bonus units, restricted and deferred stock units payable in MMC common stock or cash, and other stock-based and performance-based awards. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) determines, at its discretion, which affiliates may participate in the plans, which eligible employees will receive awards, the types of awards to be received, and the terms and conditions thereof. The right of an employee to receive an award may be subject to performance conditions as specified by the Compensation Committee. The 2000 Plans contain provisions
which, in the event of a change in control of MMC, may accelerate the vesting of the awards. Awards relating to not more than 80,000,000 shares of common stock may be made over the life of the 2000 Employee Plan plus shares remaining unused under pre-existing employee stock plans. Awards relating to not more than 8,000,000 shares of common stock may be made over the life of the 2000 Executive Plan plus shares remaining unused under pre-existing executive stock plans.

Stock Options:

Options granted under the 2000 Plans may be designated as either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. The Compensation Committee determines the terms and conditions of the option, including the time or times at which an option may be exercised, the methods by which such exercise price may be paid, and the form of such payment. Options are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of MMC’s stock at the date of grant. These option awards generally vest 25% per annum and have a contractual term of 10 years. On March 16, 2005, MMC began granting options that provide for a market-based triggering event before a vested


option can be exercised. The terms and conditions of these stock option awards provide that (i) options will vest at a rate of 25% a year beginning one year from the date of grant and (ii) each vested tranche will only become exercisable if the market price of MMC’s stock appreciates to a level of 15% above the exercise price of the option and maintains that level for at least ten (10) consecutive trading days after the award has vested. MMC accounts for these awards under SFAS 123(R) as market-condition options. The effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant-date fair value of such awards. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period and is not subsequently adjusted if the market condition is not met. For awards without a market-based triggering event, compensation cost is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period which is normally the vesting period.

At the May 2005 Annual Meeting, MMC’s shareholders approved a stock option exchange offer. Under the exchange offer, eligible employees could exchange certain deeply underwater options for new options with an estimated fair value equal to 90% of the value of options surrendered in exchange, calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Effective July 1, 2005, employees elected to exchange 42 million options for 16 million new options. The exchange resulted in the retirement of 26 million options and no incremental compensation expense was incurred in connection with the new option grants. The exercise price of the new options of $27.86 is equal to the market price of MMC’s common stock as of the new grant date. The new options were unvested when granted and will vest on the later of the second anniversary of the new option grant or the vesting date of the tendered option. The other terms and conditions of the new options are substantially
similar to those of the tendered options they replaced.

The estimated fair value of options granted without a market-based triggering event is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model. This model takes into account several factors and assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumption at the time of grant. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) is estimated using the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees’ expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. Expected volatility prior to July 1, 2005 was calculated based on historical volatility for a period equal to the stock option’s expected life, calculated on a monthly basis. Subsequent to June 30, 2005, MMC began using a blended volatility rate based on the following: (i) volatility derived from daily closing price observations for the 10-year period ended on the
valuation date, (ii) implied volatility derived from traded options for the period one week before and one week after the valuation date and (iii) average volatility for the 10-year periods ended on 15 anniversaries prior to the valuation date, using daily closing price observations. The expected dividend yield is based on expected dividends for the expected term of the stock options.

The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model for options granted by MMC in 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:

The estimated fair value of options granted with a market-based triggering event was calculated using a binomial valuation model. The factors and assumptions used in this model are similar to those utilized in the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model except that the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve over the contractual term of the option, and the expected life is calculated by the model.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of MMC’s option awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $8.55, $6.51 and $7.51, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $31 million, $36 million and $46 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $84 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s option awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is 1.4 years. Cash received from the exercise of stock options for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $52 million, $45 million, and $111 million, respectively.

MMC’s policy is to issue treasury shares upon option exercises or share unit conversion. MMC intends to issue treasury shares as long as an adequate number of those shares is available.

Restricted Stock:

Restricted shares of MMC’s common stock may be awarded under MMC’s incentive and stock award plans and are subject to restrictions on transferability and other restrictions, if any, as the Compensation Committee may impose. The Compensation Committee may also determine when and under what circumstances the restrictions may lapse and whether the participant receives the rights of a stockholder, including, without limitation, the right to vote and receive dividends. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, restricted stock that is still subject to restrictions is forfeited upon termination of employment. Shares granted generally become unrestricted at the earlier of: (1) January 1 of the year following the vesting grant date anniversary or (2) the later of the recipient’s normal or actual retirement date. For shares granted prior to 2004, the grant date anniversary is ten years. For shares granted during
2004 and 2005, the grant date anniversary is 7 years and 5 years, respectively. However, certain restricted shares granted in 2005 vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. There were no restricted shares granted in 2006.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of MMC’s restricted stock awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $28.87 and $46.12, respectively. The total fair value of MMC’s restricted stock distributed during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $1.8 million, $9.9 million, and $5.1 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units:

Restricted stock units may be awarded under MMC’s Incentive and Stock Award plans. The Compensation Committee determines the restrictions on such units, when the restrictions lapse, when the units vest and are paid, and upon what terms the units are forfeited. The cost of these awards is amortized over the vesting period, which is generally three years. Beginning with awards granted in 2006, awards to senior executives and other employees may include three-year performance-based restricted stock units and three-year service-based restricted stock units. The payout of performance-based restricted stock units (payable in shares of MMC common stock) may range from 0–200% of the number of units granted, based on the achievement of objective, pre-determined MMC or operating company performance measures over a three-year performance period. MMC accounts for these awards as performance condition restricted stock units. The
performance condition is not considered in the determination of grant date fair value of such awards. Compensation cost is recognized over the performance period based on management’s estimate of the number of units expected to vest. Compensation cost will be adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares paid out at the end of the three-year performance period. Dividend equivalents are paid on both performance-based and service-based restricted stock units prior to payout, based on the initial grant amount.

Deferred Stock Units:

Deferred stock units may be awarded under MMC’s incentive and stock award plans. The Compensation Committee determines the restrictions on such units, when the restrictions lapse, when the units vest and are paid, and upon what terms the units are forfeited. The cost of these awards is amortized over the vesting period, which is generally three years.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $203 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards.

MMC Stock Purchase Plans

In May 1999, MMC’s stockholders approved an employee stock purchase plan (the “1999 Plan”) to replace the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “1994 Plan”), which terminated on September 30, 1999 following its fifth annual offering. Effective October 1, 2004, certain features in these plans were changed. Under these new features, shares are purchased four times during the plan year (instead of one annual purchase on the last business day of the plan year as was done previously). Beginning October 1, 2005, shares are purchased at a price that is 95% of the average market price on each quarterly purchase date. Under the 1999 Plan, no more than 40,000,000 shares of MMC’s common stock plus the remaining unissued shares in the 1994 Plan may be sold. Employees purchased 2,073,818 shares during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, 22,106,328 shares were available for issuance under the 1999 Plan. In July 2002, the
MMC Board of Directors approved an additional 5,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 1995 MMC Stock Purchase Plan for International Employees (the “International Plan”). With the additional shares under the International Plan, no more than 8,000,000 shares of MMC’s common stock may be sold. Employees purchased 400,026 shares during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, 279,550 shares were available for issuance under the International Plan. Based on the terms in effect as of October 1, 2005, the plan is considered non-compensatory under SFAS 123(R).


Putnam Investments Equity Partnership Plan

Under the Putnam Investments Equity Partnership Plan, as amended (the “Equity Plan”), Putnam is authorized to grant or sell shares to certain employees of Putnam or its subsidiaries restricted common shares of Putnam Investments Trust, the parent of Putnam Investments, LLC (“Class B Common Shares”) and grant options to acquire the Class B Common Shares. Such awards or options generally vest over a period of two to four years. Holders of Putnam Class B Common Shares are not entitled to vote and have no rights to convert their shares into any other securities of Putnam. Awards of restricted stock and/or options may be made under the Equity Plan with respect to a maximum of 16,500,000 shares of Class B Common Shares, which would represent approximately 16% of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis, as increased for certain issuances of Putnam Class A Common Stock to MMC.

Options on Class B Shares:

Options on Class B shares of Putnam’s common stock, which may be awarded under the Equity Plan, are subject to restrictions on transferability and other restrictions, if any, as the Compensation Committee may impose. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, the exercise price for each option is the fair market value of a Class B share on the date of the option grant. All options granted to a participant become exercisable in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the applicable award agreement, provided that the Compensation Committee has the right to accelerate the exercisability of any option. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Equity Plan, each option shall terminate on and shall not be exercisable after the tenth or sixth anniversary of the grant date of such option, as applicable.

On September 29, 2005, certain eligible participants in the Equity Plan participated in a voluntary option exchange pursuant to the terms of the Offer to Exchange Certain Outstanding Options (the “Offer to Exchange”), dated August 30, 2005. Under the Offer to Exchange, holders of options on Class B shares meeting certain eligibility requirements could elect to exchange those options for restricted shares with the equivalent value of the exchanged options, as determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. As a result of the Offer to Exchange, a total of 2,201,850 options were retired and 139,388 restricted shares were issued at a grant price of $28.26 per share, which vest on September 1, 2007.

The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model for options granted by Putnam in 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:

As of December 31, 2006, there was $15 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to Putnam’s option awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is 1.7 years.

Restricted Stock:

Restricted shares of Putnam’s common stock which may be awarded or sold under the Equity Plan are subject to restrictions on transferability and other restrictions, if any, as the Compensation Committee may impose. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, restricted stock that is still subject to restrictions is forfeited upon termination of employment. All restricted stock granted or sold to a participant vests in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the applicable award agreement, provided that the Compensation Committee has the right to accelerate the vesting of any restricted stock.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $94 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to Putnam’s restricted stock awards.


10. Long-term Commitments

MMC leases office facilities, equipment and automobiles under noncancelable operating leases. These leases expire on varying dates; in some instances contain renewal and expansion options; do not restrict the payment of dividends or the incurrence of debt or additional lease obligations; and contain no significant purchase options. In addition to the base rental costs, occupancy lease agreements generally provide for rent escalations resulting from increased assessments for real estate taxes and other charges. Approximately 97% of MMC’s lease obligations are for the use of office space.

The consolidated statements of income include net rental costs of $529 million, $470 million and $485 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, after deducting rentals from subleases ($28 million in 2006, $22 million in 2005 and $20 million in 2004).

At December 31, 2006, the aggregate future minimum rental commitments under all noncancelable operating lease agreements are as follows:

The weighted average interest rates on MMC’s outstanding short-term debt (excluding current portion of long-term debt) at December 31, 2006 and 2005 are 6.2% and 6.0%, respectively.

In December 2005, MMC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new $1.2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. Subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by MMC. The facility expires in December 2010. It replaces MMC’s $1.0 billion and $700 million revolving credit facilities, which were scheduled to expire in 2007 and 2009, respectively. The interest rate on this facility varies based upon the level of usage of the facility and MMC’s credit ratings. The facility requires MMC to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios tested quarterly. There was approximately $94 million outstanding at December 31, 2006 and $510 million outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2005. Proceeds from the borrowings were used primarily to fund the repatriation of accumulated earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

In September 2005, MMC entered into a 30-year $475 million fixed rate non-recourse mortgage loan agreement due 2035, bearing an interest rate of 5.7%, in connection with its interest in its worldwide headquarters building in New York City. MMC prepaid its existing $200 million 9.8% mortgage due 2009.

The incremental proceeds from the refinancing, net of mortgage prepayment costs were used to repay outstanding short-term debt. In the event the mortgage is foreclosed following a default, MMC would be entitled to remain in the space and would be obligated to pay rent sufficient to cover interest on the notes or at fair market value if greater. Mortgage prepayment costs of $34 million related to this transaction are included in interest expense in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005.


In September 2005, MMC issued $550 million of 5.15% Senior Notes due 2010 and $750 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2015 (the “2005 Notes”). The net proceeds from the 2005 Notes were used to pay down the $1.3 billion term loan facility.

Additional credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit are maintained with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $270 million at December 31, 2006 and $354 million at December 31, 2005. There was $8 million outstanding at December 31, 2006 and there was $83 million outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2005.

Scheduled repayments of long-term debt in 2007 and in the four succeeding years are $1.1 billion, $258 million, $408 million, $559 million and $9 million, respectively.

12. Financial Instruments

The estimated fair value of MMC’s significant financial instruments is provided below. Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that MMC would realize upon disposition nor do they indicate MMC’s intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

: The estimated fair value of MMC’s cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value.

Long-term Investments

: Long-term investments include available for sale and trading securities recorded at quoted market prices as discussed below. MMC also has certain additional long-term investments, for which there are no readily available market prices, amounting to $75 million and $54 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which are carried on a cost basis. MMC monitors these investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary.

MMC had available for sale securities and trading investments with an aggregate fair value of $523 million and $223 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which are carried at market value under SFAS 115. Gross unrealized gains amounting to $53 million and $82 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, have been excluded from earnings and reported, net of deferred income taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a component of stockholders’ equity.

MMC recorded net gains associated with its available for sale securities of $39 million, $158 million and $102 million, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $66 million, $293 million and $170 million, respectively. Gross realized gains on available for sale securities sold during 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounted to $41 million, $158 million and $107 million, respectively. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, MMC recorded losses of $2 million, $0 million and $5 million, respectively, related to the decline in value of certain available for sale securities that were other than temporary. The cost of securities sold is determined using the average cost method for equity securities. The gains and losses described above are included in Investment income (loss) in the consolidated statements of income.

MMC also holds investments in certain private equity fund partnerships which are accounted for using the equity method. MMC’s share of gains from such investments, and from trading securities and investments held at cost, of $187 million, $29 million and $98 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, is included in Investment income (loss) in the consolidated statements of income.


A portion of insurance fiduciary funds which MMC holds to satisfy fiduciary obligations is invested in high quality debt securities which are generally held to maturity. The difference between cost and fair value of these investments is not material.

Short-term and Long-term Debt

: The fair value of MMC’s short-term debt which consists of bank loans approximates its carrying value. The estimated fair value of MMC’s long-term debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.

13. Integration and Restructuring Costs

2006 Plan

In September 2006, MMC announced that it would undertake restructuring activities designed to enhance operational efficiencies and improve profitability (the “2006 Plan”). The restructuring activities are expected to be implemented in several phases – the first phase which began in September and is expected to be completed over the next two quarters, and one or more additional phases. In connection with Phase 1 of the 2006 Plan, MMC incurred net restructuring charges of $10 million during the third and fourth quarter of 2006, as follows: risk and insurance services - $49 million, risk consulting & technology - $1 million, consulting - $28 million and corporate - $(68) million. The corporate amount includes a $74 million gain on the sale of five (5) floors in MMC’s headquarters building. Utilization of the 2006 Plan charges for Phase 1 is summarized as follows:

As part of its ongoing review of operations, Marsh has identified additional actions that are expected to result in the reduction of 170 positions (“Phase 2”). These actions are expected to result in additional charges of approximately $40 million related to severance and exit costs for facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2006, MMC incurred costs of $14 million related to Phase 2 of the 2006 Plan, primarily related to severance and exit costs for facilities.

The expenses associated with the restructuring plans are included in Compensation and benefits or in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income, and liabilities associated with these initiatives are classified on the consolidated balance sheets as Accounts payable, Other liabilities, or Accrued salaries, depending on the nature of the items.

14. Common Stock

MMC did not repurchased common stock in 2006 and 2005.


15. Stockholder Rights Plan

On September 18, 1997, MMC’s Board of Directors approved the extension of the benefits afforded by MMC’s previously existing rights plan by adopting a new stockholder rights plan, which was amended and restated as of January 20, 2000 and further amended on June 7, 2002. Under the current plan, Rights to purchase stock, at a rate of one Right for each common share held, were distributed to shareholders of record on September 29, 1997 and automatically attach to shares issued thereafter. Under the plan, the Rights generally become exercisable after a person or group (i) acquires 15% or more of MMC’s outstanding common stock or (ii) commences a tender offer that would result in such a person or group owning 15% or more of MMC’s common stock. When the Rights first become exercisable, a holder will be entitled to buy from MMC a unit consisting of one six-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of MMC at a purchase
price of $200. If any person acquires 15% or more of MMC’s common stock or if a 15% holder acquires MMC by means of a reverse merger in which MMC and its stock survive, each Right not owned by a 15% or more shareholder would become exercisable for common stock of MMC (or in certain circumstances, other consideration) having a market value equal to twice the exercise price of the Right. The Rights expire on September 29, 2007, except as otherwise provided in the plan.

16. Claims, Lawsuits and Other Contingencies

Claims, Lawsuits and Other Contingencies

MMC and Marsh Litigation and Regulatory Matters

Brokerage Compensation Practices Settlement

In January 2005, MMC and its subsidiary Marsh Inc. (“Marsh”) entered into an agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with the New York State Attorney General (“NYAG”) and the New York State Insurance Department (“NYSID”) to settle a civil complaint filed in New York State court by NYAG in October 2004 (the “NYAG Lawsuit”) and a related citation (the “Citation”) issued by NYSID at approximately the same time. Among other things, the NYAG Lawsuit and the Citation had alleged that Marsh’s use of market service agreements with various insurance companies entailed fraudulent business practices, bid-rigging, illegal restraint of trade and other violations of the New York business and insurance statutes, and was not adequately disclosed to Marsh’s clients or MMC’s investors. Following the announcement of the NYAG Lawsuit and related actions taken by MMC, MMC’s
stock price dropped from approximately $45 per share to a low of approximately $22.75 per share.

Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, MMC established a fund of $850 million (the “Fund”), payable over four years, for policyholder clients in the U.S who placed insurance through Marsh between 2001 and 2004. Approximately 70,000 eligible policyholders have elected to receive an aggregate distribution of approximately $750 million under the Fund. Clients who elected to participate in the Fund tendered a release relating to the matters alleged in the NYAG Lawsuit and the Citation, except for claims that are based upon, arise out of or relate to the purchase or sale of MMC securities. No portion of the Fund represents a fine or penalty against MMC or Marsh and no portion of the Fund will revert to MMC or Marsh.

The Settlement Agreement does not relate to any former or current employees of Marsh. Since the filing of the NYAG Lawsuit, 12 former Marsh employees have pleaded guilty to New York criminal charges relating to the matters described therein. In September 2005, eight former Marsh employees (including one individual who has since pleaded guilty) were indicted on various counts relating to these same matters. Trials are scheduled to begin in April 2007.


Related Litigation

Numerous lawsuits have been commenced against MMC, one or more of its subsidiaries, and their current and former directors and officers, relating to matters alleged in the NYAG Lawsuit, including the following:

Various putative class actions purportedly brought on behalf of policyholders were filed in or removed to several federal courts across the country. All of these federal putative class actions were transferred to the District of New Jersey for consolidated pretrial proceedings (the “MDL Cases”).

In August 2005, two consolidated amended complaints were filed in the MDL Cases (one on behalf of a purported class of “commercial” policyholders and the second on behalf of a purported class of “employee benefit” policyholders), which as against MMC and certain affiliates allege statutory claims for violations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (“RICO”) Act and federal and state antitrust laws, together with common law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. The complaints seek a variety of remedies, including unspecified monetary damages, treble
damages, disgorgement, restitution, punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees and costs. The class periods alleged in the MDL Cases begin on August 26, 1994 and purport to continue to the date of any class certification. MMC and the other defendants have moved to dismiss the two consolidated amended complaints, and the plaintiffs have moved for class certification. A hearing on the motions to dismiss has been scheduled for March 1, 2007. No hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification has been scheduled.

Four class or representative actions on behalf of policyholders are pending in state courts. There are also 23 actions brought by individual policyholders and others in federal and state courts relating to matters alleged in the NYAG Lawsuit. MMC expects that all policyholder actions filed in the U.S. federal courts will be transferred to the District of New Jersey as described above. In addition,
two putative class actions and one individual policyholder action are pending in Canada.

In January 2005, the State of Connecticut brought an action against MMC, Marsh and certain Marsh subsidiaries in Connecticut Superior Court. As subsequently amended, the State’s complaint alleges that the defendants violated Connecticut’s Unfair Trade Practices Act by accepting $50,000 from an insurer in connection with a placement Marsh made for the State; violated Connecticut’s antitrust and unfair trade practices acts by engaging in bid rigging and other improper conduct that purportedly damaged particular customers and inflated insurance premiums; improperly accepted contingent commissions and concealed these commissions from their clients; and engaged in negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty.

The State seeks various monetary damages and injunctive relief. Discovery has been stayed pending motions on the pleadings.

On March 14, 2006, the State of Florida brought an action against MMC, Marsh and certain Marsh subsidiaries in Florida state court, alleging that the defendants violated Florida’s RICO and antitrust laws by engaging in bid rigging and other improper conduct which inflated insurance premiums, and by receiving undisclosed additional compensation. The complaint alleges that these actions caused damage to the State, Florida governmental entities and Florida businesses and residents, and seeks the forfeiture of all undisclosed compensation, treble damages, civil penalties, attorneys’ fees and costs and injunctive and other equitable

relief. Discovery has commenced in this action.

A consolidated purported class action is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of individuals and entities who purchased or acquired MMC’s publicly-traded securities during the purported class period of October 14, 1999 to October 13, 2004 (the “MMC SDNY Securities Case”). The pending complaint of the lead


plaintiffs in this action names MMC, Marsh, MMC’s former CEO and one former Marsh officer as defendants. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that MMC artificially inflated its share price by making misrepresentations and omissions relating to Marsh’s market service agreements and business practices. Plaintiffs allege that MMC also failed to disclose alleged anti-competitive and illegal practices at Marsh, such as “bid rigging” and soliciting fictitious quotes.

The complaint includes factual allegations similar to those asserted in the NYAG Lawsuit, as well as factual allegations concerning alleged misconduct at MMC’s subsidiaries Mercer and Putnam, and alleged conflicts of interest associated with MMC’s former private equity subsidiary, MMC Capital. The complaint includes claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Sections 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, based on MMC’s allegedly false or incomplete disclosures. MMC has responded to the complaint and formal discovery will soon commence in this matter. The federal securities claims in a separate shareholder action were transferred for consideration in connection with the federal securities claims asserted in the MMC SDNY Securities Case. The plaintiff in this separate action has purported to add a claim under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

A number of individual shareholder actions against MMC and others are pending in various state courts. One such action filed in California state court has been removed and transferred for inclusion in the MMC SDNY Securities case. A number of related actions that were

commenced in New York state court have been removed and transferred for inclusion in the MMC SDNY Securities Case; plaintiffs have moved to remand the actions back to state court.

Several shareholder derivative actions are pending against MMC’s current and former directors and officers. Six have been consolidated as a single action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Derivative Action”), and five have been consolidated as a single action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Federal Derivative Action”). One action is pending in the New York Supreme Court for New York County. These shareholder derivative actions allege, among other things, that current and former directors and officers of MMC breached their fiduciary duties with respect to the alleged misconduct described in the NYAG Lawsuit, are liable to MMC for damages arising from their alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, and must contribute to or indemnify MMC for any damages MMC has suffered. The derivative action pending in the New York Supreme Court has been stayed pending resolution of the
Federal Derivative Action. The Federal Derivative Action has been stayed in favor of the Delaware Derivative Action, which remains in its preliminary stages.

MMC has also received six demand letters from stockholders asking the MMC Board of Directors to take appropriate legal action against those directors and officers who are alleged to have caused damages to MMC based on the facts alleged in the NYAG Lawsuit. MMC has advised the stockholders making demands that their demands are under consideration by the MMC Board of Directors.

A proceeding consolidating twenty purported class actions alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of the Marsh & McLennan Companies Stock Investment Plan (the “Plan”). The consolidated class action complaint names MMC and various current and former employees, officers and directors as defendants and alleges, among other things, that in view of the purportedly fraudulent bidding activity and the receipt of contingent commissions pursuant to

the market service agreements referred to above, the defendants knew or should have known that the investment of the Plan’s assets in MMC stock was imprudent. The consolidated complaint also asserts that certain defendants failed to provide the Plan’s participants with

complete and accurate information about MMC stock, that certain defendants responsible


for selecting, removing and monitoring other fiduciaries did not comply with ERISA, and that MMC knowingly participated in other defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duties. The consolidated complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees and costs. The amount of Plan assets invested in MMC stock at October 13, 2004 (immediately prior to the announcement of the NYAG Lawsuit) was approximately $1.2 billion. The consolidated complaint alleges that during the purported class period, which extends from July 1, 2000 until January 31, 2005, MMC’s stock price fell from $52.22 to $32.50. In December 2006, the court granted in part and denied in part the motions to dismiss filed by MMC and the other defendants. Discovery is commencing in this matter.

In February 2005, the plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative suit pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “AIG Delaware Suit”) against the directors and officers of American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”) filed a consolidated complaint which, as subsequently amended, names as additional defendants MMC, Marsh, Marsh USA Inc., Marsh Global Broking Inc. (collectively, the “MMC Corporate Defendants”), MMC’s former CEO, and five former Marsh employees who have pleaded guilty to certain criminal charges (the former CEO and former employees, together with the MMC Corporate Defendants, the “MMC Defendants”). The AIG Delaware Suit alleges, among other things, that the MMC

Defendants, certain AIG employees and others engaged in conspiracy and common law fraud with respect to the alleged misconduct described in the NYAG Lawsuit, including, but not limited to, illegal bid rigging and
kickback schemes, and that AIG was harmed thereby. This action further alleges that the MMC Corporate Defendants aided and abetted the current and former directors and officers of AIG in breaching their fiduciary duties to AIG with respect to AIG’s participation in the alleged misconduct and that the MMC Corporate Defendants were unjustly enriched. The consolidated complaint asserts that the MMC Defendants are liable to AIG for damages and also seeks the return of all contingent commission payments made by AIG to the MMC Corporate Defendants.

In May 2005, the plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative suit pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “AIG Federal Suit”) against the directors and officers of AIG filed a consolidated complaint naming MMC, Marsh USA, Inc., Marsh Global Broking, Inc. and MMC’s former CEO as additional defendants. Based on similar factual allegations as in the AIG
Delaware Suit, the plaintiffs assert claims against MMC and the former CEO for allegedly aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties by AIG’s directors and officers and for unjust enrichment, and seek damages and the disgorgement of contingent commissions. Both the AIG Delaware Suit and the AIG Federal Suit are stayed by orders of the respective courts pending review by a special litigation committee formed by the AIG board of directors. In addition, plaintiffs’ counsel in a federal securities fraud purported class action against AIG and others (to which MMC is not a party) relating to price declines in AIG’s stock has indicated that plaintiffs may assert claims against MMC in that action.

In May 2005, the plaintiffs in a purported securities fraud class action suit pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Axis Capital Holdings Limited (“Axis”) and certain of its officers filed a consolidated complaint that named MMC, among others, as an additional defendant. On October 17, 2006, the court granted all defendants’ motions to dismiss without prejudice. Plaintiffs have since advised the court that no amended complaint will be filed and the case has been closed.

Related Regulatory Matters

Following the filing of the NYAG Lawsuit, MMC and certain of its subsidiaries received notices of investigations and inquiries, together with requests for documents and information, from attorneys general, departments of insurance and other state and federal governmental entities in a number of jurisdictions (other than New York) that relate to the allegations in


the NYAG Lawsuit. MMC and its subsidiaries have cooperated with these requests from regulators. MMC has been contacted by certain of the above state entities indicating that they may file civil actions or otherwise seek additional monetary or other remedies from MMC.

In September 2005, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) issued a press release indicating that over 30 state insurance regulators (including several referred to in the preceding paragraph) working collaboratively through the NAIC had reached a multi-state regulatory settlement with MMC and Marsh. The NAIC settlement agreement reaffirms MMC’s commitment, under the Settlement Agreement with NYAG and the NYSID, to establish a no-fault compensation fund for policyholder clients across the United States, and provides for state-by-state enforcement of the business reforms agreed to be implemented pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The NAIC settlement agreement has been executed by MMC and Marsh, and the NAIC has advised that the agreement has been adopted by insurance commissioners in 33 states, the District of Columbia and Guam.

Putnam-Related Matters

On January 31, 2007, MMC entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Putnam Sale Agreement”) with Great-West Lifeco Inc. (“GWL”), a majority-owned subsidiary of Power Financial Corporation, pursuant to which GWL has agreed to purchase Putnam Investments Trust. The Putnam Sale Agreement provides that MMC will indemnify GWL with respect to certain Putnam-related litigation and regulatory matters following the closing of this transaction, as indicated below. MMC expects the sale of Putnam to close in mid-2007.

Regulatory Matters

In 2003 and 2004, Putnam entered into settlements (the “Putnam Trading Settlements”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Massachusetts Securities Division”) with respect to excessive short-term trading by certain former Putnam employees in shares of the Putnam mutual funds (the “Putnam Funds”). Under the Putnam Trading Settlements, Putnam agreed to pay a total of $193.5 million ($108.5 million in restitution and $85 million in civil fines and penalties). In addition to the $108.5 million in restitution, Putnam Funds shareholders will receive a distribution of $45 million from the civil penalty Putnam previously paid to the SEC. An independent distribution consultant has developed a proposed plan that provides for the distribution of the restitution amounts to Putnam Funds shareholders. The proposed plan is currently being reviewed by the staffs of the SEC and the
Massachusetts Securities Division. Putnam will incur additional costs in connection with implementing the distribution plan.

Commencing in July 2004, the Enforcement Staff of the SEC’s Boston Office inquired into the calculation of certain cost reimbursements paid by the Putnam Funds to Putnam for transfer agent services relating to defined contribution operations within Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company (“PFTC”). Following review by Putnam and the Trustees of the Putnam Funds, Putnam paid the Putnam Funds approximately $37 million to resolve these issues.

In October 2004, the Department of Labor (“DOL”) indicated its preliminary belief that Putnam may have violated certain provisions of ERISA related to investments by the Putnam Profit Sharing Retirement Plan and certain discretionary ERISA accounts in Putnam Funds that pay 12b-1 fees. In December 2004, Putnam made a written submission to the DOL addressing these issues. Putnam and the DOL have entered into a tolling agreement and are exchanging further information pertaining to this issue.

Since January 2004, the NASD made several requests to Putnam for information relating to reimbursement of expenses to participants at certain sales meetings during the period from 2001 to 2004. In December 2006, Putnam entered into an acceptance, waiver and consent with the NASD and paid $175,000 to resolve this matter.


“Market-Timing”-Related Litigation

MMC and Putnam have received a substantial number of civil complaints, filed in various state and federal courts, based on allegations of “market-timing” and, in some cases, “late trading” activities. All of the actions filed in federal court have been transferred, along with actions against other mutual fund complexes, to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. The lead plaintiffs in those cases filed consolidated amended complaints in September 2004. MMC and Putnam moved to dismiss the various complaints pending in federal court in Maryland, which are described below:

MMC and Putnam, along with certain of their former officers and directors, were named in a consolidated amended class action complaint (the “MMC Class Action”) purportedly brought on behalf of all purchasers of the publicly-traded securities of MMC between January 3, 2000 and November 3, 2003 (the “Class Period”). In general, the MMC Class Action alleges that the defendants, including MMC, allowed certain mutual fund investors and fund managers to engage in market-timing in the Putnam Funds. The complaint further alleges that this conduct was not disclosed until late 2003, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint alleges that, as a result of defendants’ purportedly misleading statements or omissions, MMC’s stock traded at inflated levels during the Class Period. The suit seeks unspecified damages and equitable relief. In an order entered October 13,
2006, the district court dismissed all claims against all defendants in the MMC Class Action.

Putnam is a defendant in a second consolidated amended complaint filed on behalf of a putative class of investors in certain Putnam Funds (the “Putnam Class Action”). A separate consolidated amended complaint filed by certain fund investors purporting to assert derivative claims on behalf of all Putnam Funds (the “Putnam Derivative Action”) named as defendants MMC, Putnam, various Putnam affiliates, certain trustees of the Putnam Funds, certain present and former Putnam officers and employees, and persons and entities that allegedly engaged in or facilitated market-timing or late trading activities in the Putnam Funds. Both suits seek to recover unspecified damages allegedly suffered by the funds and their shareholders as a result of purported market-timing and late trading activity that allegedly occurred in certain Putnam Funds. The Putnam Derivative Action seeks additional relief, including termination of the investment advisory contracts between
Putnam and the Funds, cancellation of the Funds’ 12b-1 plans and the return of all advisory and 12b-1 fees paid by the Funds over a certain period of time. In the Putnam Derivative Action, the court has dismissed all claims against MMC and all claims against Putnam except a claim under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act. The second consolidated amended complaint in the Putnam Class Action, filed after the court dismissed certain other claims in the first consolidated amended complaint, asserts against Putnam claims under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Putnam has answered this second consolidated amended complaint and the parties are engaged in fact discovery in this matter.

A consolidated amended complaint asserting shareholder derivative claims has been filed, purportedly on behalf of MMC, against current and former members of MMC’s Board of Directors, two of Putnam’s former officers, and MMC as a nominal defendant (the “MMC

Derivative Action”). The MMC Derivative Action generally alleges that the members of MMC’s Board of Directors violated the fiduciary duties they owed to MMC and its shareholders by failing to provide oversight regarding market-timing in the Putnam Funds, as a result of which MMC suffered damages. The suit seeks unspecified damages and equitable relief. Pursuant to an agreement of the parties, the MMC Derivative Action was stayed in May 2005.


MMC, Putnam, and various of their current and former officers, directors and employees have been named as defendants in two consolidated amended complaints that purportedly assert class action claims under ERISA (the “ERISA Actions”). The ERISA Actions, which have been brought by participants in MMC’s Stock Investment Plan and Putnam’s Profit Sharing Retirement Plan, allege, among other things, that, in view of the market-timing trading activity that was allegedly allowed to occur at Putnam, the defendants knew or should have known that the investment of the plans’ funds in MMC stock and the Putnam Funds was imprudent and that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the plan participants in making these investments. The ERISA Actions seek unspecified damages and equitable relief, including the restoration to the plans of all profits the defendants allegedly made through the use of the plans’ assets, an order compelling the
defendants to make good to the plans all losses to the plans allegedly resulting from defendants’ alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties, and the imposition of a constructive trust on any amounts by which any defendant allegedly was unjustly enriched at the expense of the plans. On September 15, 2006, the ERISA Action regarding the Putnam Profit Sharing Retirement Plan was dismissed against all defendants; the plaintiff has appealed that decision. In November 2006 the parties agreed to stay the ERISA Action regarding the MMC Stock Investment Plan.

A number of the Putnam Funds have been named as defendants in a purported class action brought on behalf of certain holders of the funds’ Class B shares who either (i) held such shares and were subject to certain contingent deferred sales charges (“CDSCs”) as of October 28, 2003, or (ii) were assessed a CDSC for redeeming such shares on or after October 28, 2003. Plaintiff alleges that Putnam engaged in misconduct constituting a breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing with purported class members by allowing market-timing. Plaintiff seeks, among other things, actual damages or statutory damages of $25 for each class member (whichever is greater) and relief from paying a CDSC for redeeming Class B shares. In August 2005, this action was transferred to the consolidated proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, described above.

Putnam has agreed to indemnify the Putnam Funds for any liabilities arising from market-timing activities, including those that could arise in the above securities litigations, and MMC has agreed to guarantee Putnam’s obligations in that regard.

As discussed more fully in Article 11.02(a)(iii) of the Putnam Sale Agreement, MMC will indemnify GWL for any Damages (as defined in the Putnam Sale Agreement) arising from any claim, action, suit, investigation, proceeding or inquiry currently pending or arising before December 31, 2008, that results from any alleged “market timing” activity in trading by any person in the Putnam Funds (including frequent trading and late trading), as that term was used in the proceedings brought by the SEC and the Massachusetts Securities Division that were the subject of the Putnam Trading Settlements, to the extent the alleged activity occurs before the closing of the sale of Putnam.

Other Putnam Litigation

Putnam and Putnam Retail Management Limited Partnership have been sued in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts for alleged violations of Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 in connection with the receipt of purportedly excessive advisory and distribution fees paid by certain Putnam Funds in which plaintiffs purportedly owned shares (the “Putnam Excessive Fee Litigation”). Plaintiffs seek, among other things, to recover certain advisory and distribution fees paid to defendants by those funds beginning one year prior to the filing of the complaint, rescission of the management and distribution agreements between defendants and the funds, and a prospective reduction in fees. In January 2006, the court granted defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment, limiting the scope of the suit to the fees paid by five Putnam Funds. Plaintiffs filed a new complaint which seeks the same form of relief as the original
complaint, is limited to the fees paid by


the five funds at issue, and seeks relief for a period after the filing of the original complaint. In February 2007, the Court denied defendants’ motion to stay the new complaint and granted plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate the two cases. The parties are engaged in fact discovery.

As described more fully in Section 11.02(a)(iii) of the Putnam Sale Agreement, MMC will indemnify GWL for any Damages (as defined in the Putnam Sale Agreement) arising under (i) the Putnam Excessive Fee Litigation and (ii) any further claim, action, suit, investigation, proceeding or inquiry arising before the third anniversary of the closing of the sale of Putnam that results from the same specific conduct (i.e., the same particular actions or conduct at the same particular time and involving the same mutual funds) involving “excessive fees” purportedly violating Section 36(b) of the Investment
Company Act that is the subject of the Putnam Excessive Fee Litigation.

Certain Putnam entities have been named as defendants in a suit brought in the District Court of Travis County, Texas by a former institutional client, the Employee Retirement System of Texas. Plaintiff alleges that Putnam breached its investment management advisory agreement and did not make appropriate disclosures at the time the investment management advisory agreement was executed.

Other Governmental Inquiries Relating to MMC and its Subsidiaries

Since early 2003, the SEC has issued two subpoenas to MMC or its affiliates and has made additional requests for information relating to the SEC’s investigation of loss mitigation products. MMC and its subsidiaries have received similar inquiries from regulators and other authorities in several states. In April 2005, the Office of Insurance Regulation in the State of Florida issued a subpoena to MMC’s subsidiary Guy Carpenter & Company, Inc. concerning certain reinsurance products. In May 2005, the Office of Insurance and Fire Safety Commissioner in the State of Georgia issued a subpoena to MMC that requested, among other things, information relating to finite insurance placements. In May 2005, the Office of the Attorney General in the State of Connecticut issued a subpoena to MMC concerning finite insurance. MMC and its subsidiaries are cooperating with these and other informal inquiries relating to loss mitigation products.

In February 2005, the DOL served a subpoena on MMC seeking documents pertaining to services provided by MMC subsidiaries to employee benefit plans, including documents relating to how such subsidiaries have been compensated for such services. The request also sought information concerning market service agreements and the solicitation of bids from insurance companies in connection with services to employee benefit plans. MMC is cooperating with the DOL.

In December 2004, MMC received a request for information pursuant to a formal investigation commenced by the SEC. The request for information seeks documents concerning related-party transactions of MMC or MMC subsidiaries in which transactions a director, executive officer or 5% stockholder of MMC had a direct or indirect material interest. In April 2005, MMC received a subpoena from the SEC broadening the scope of the original request. MMC is cooperating in the investigation. Certain current and former employees of MMC have testified in connection with this matter.

Other Matters Relating to MMC and its Subsidiaries

The governor of Alaska has introduced a bill in the state legislature seeking funding to institute a lawsuit against Mercer HR. We understand that the lawsuit, if instituted, would seek potentially significant damages relating to Mercer HR’s performance of consulting services for Alaska’s public employee pension fund.


MMC and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of other claims, lawsuits and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such claims and lawsuits consist principally of alleged errors and omissions (known as E&O’s) in connection with the performance of professional services. Some of these claims seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant. MMC provides for these exposures by a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance. For policy years 2000-2001 and prior, substantial third-party insurance is in place above the annual aggregate limit of MMC’s self-insured retention, which was $50 million annually for policy years 1998-1999, 1999-2000 and 2000-2001. To the extent that expected losses exceed MMC’s self-insured retention in any policy year, MMC records an asset for the amount that MMC expects to recover under its third-party insurance programs. The policy limits and coverage
terms of the third-party insurance vary to some extent by policy year, but MMC is not aware of coverage defenses or other obstacles to coverage that would limit recoveries in those years in a material amount. In policy years subsequent to 2000-2001, the availability of third-party insurance has declined substantially, which has caused MMC to assume increasing levels of self-insurance. MMC utilizes internal actuarial and other estimates, and case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, to establish loss reserves which it believes are adequate to provide for this self-insured retention. These reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant.

In connection with its acquisition of U.K.-based Sedgwick Group in 1998, MMC acquired several insurance underwriting businesses that were already in run-off, including River Thames Insurance Company Limited (“River Thames”), which MMC sold in 2001. Sedgwick guaranteed payment of claims on certain policies underwritten through the Institute of London Underwriters (the “ILU”) by River Thames (such guarantee being hereinafter referred to as the “ILU Guarantee”). The policies covered by the ILU Guarantee are reinsured up to £40 million by a related party of River Thames. Payment of claims under the reinsurance agreement is collateralized by segregated assets held in a trust. As of December 31, 2006, the reinsurance coverage exceeded the best estimate of the projected liability of the policies covered by the ILU Guarantee. To the extent River Thames or the reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations under those policies, a claimant may
seek to recover from MMC under the ILU Guarantee.

From 1980 to 1983, MMC owned indirectly the English & American Insurance Company (“E&A”), which was a member of the ILU. The ILU required MMC to guarantee a portion of E&A’s obligations. After E&A became insolvent in 1993, the ILU agreed to discharge the guarantee in exchange for MMC’s agreement to post an evergreen letter of credit that is available to pay claims by policyholders on certain E&A policies issued through the ILU and incepting between July 3, 1980 and October 6, 1983. In April, 2006, a lawsuit was commenced in the Commercial Court in London against MMC and the ILU by an assignee of an E&A policyholder that purports to have a claim against the MMC letter of credit in the amount of approximately $8.5 million and seeks a judicial declaration of its rights as an assignee of a policyholder claim. MMC is contesting the claim. MMC anticipates that additional claimants may seek to recover against the letter of
credit.

The proceedings and other matters described in this Note 16 on Claims, Lawsuits and Other Contingencies may expose MMC to liability for significant monetary damages and other forms of relief. Where a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, MMC has established reserves in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”. Except as specifically set forth above, MMC’s management is unable, at the present time, to provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to the foregoing matters or the impact they may have on MMC’s consolidated results of operations or financial position (over and above MMC’s existing loss reserves) or MMC’s cash flows (to the extent not covered by insurance). The principal reasons for this are that many of these cases, particularly the matters related to “market service agreements” and “market-timing”, remain in their early stages and only limited
discovery, if any, has taken place. Thus, at this time, it


is not possible to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss on these matters. Adverse determinations in one or more of the matters discussed above could have a material impact on MMC’s financial condition or the results of MMC’s operations in a future period.

17. Segment Information

MMC’s organization structure and segment reporting is based on the types of services provided.

Results are reported in four segments:

Risk and Insurance Services

, comprising insurance services (Marsh), reinsurance services (Guy Carpenter), and Risk Capital Holdings;

Risk Consulting & Technology

(Kroll);

Consulting

, including Mercer Human Resource Consulting and Mercer’s Specialty Consulting businesses; and

Investment Management

(Putnam).

MMC has reclassified prior year amounts to reflect Kroll Securities International as a discontinued operation.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements described in Note 1. The information in the following table excludes the results of Kroll Securities International, Crump, Price Forbes and SCMS, which are classified as discontinued operations. Revenues are attributed to geographic areas on the basis of where the services are performed. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment operating income, which includes investment income and losses attributable to each segment, directly related expenses, and charges or credits related to integration and restructuring but not MMC corporate-level expenses. Starting in the first quarter of 2006 segment results also include stock option expense, described in more detail below.

Change in Segment Measurement

MMC adopted SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” effective July 1, 2005. As a result, MMC incurred incremental costs, primarily related to stock options, of $64 million for the third and fourth quarters of 2005. These costs are recorded in Corporate. Starting in the first quarter of 2006, MMC changed the measurement of its segment results to include the cost of stock options. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, expenses related to stock options was $116 million: Risk and Insurance Services - $47 million, Risk Consulting & Technology - $2 million, Consulting - $41 million, Investment Management - $14 million and Corporate - $12 million.

18. Subsequent Event

On January 31, 2007, MMC entered into a stock purchase agreement with Great-West Lifeco Inc. (“GWL”), a majority-owned subsidiary of Power Financial Corporation, pursuant to which GWL will purchase Putnam Investments Trust for $3.9 billion in cash. The sale includes Putnam’s interest in the T.H. Lee private equity business. The purchase price is subject to possible adjustments based on (i) changes in Putnam’s adjusted stockholders’ equity between September 30, 2006 and closing and (ii) any decline below an agreed threshold in Putnam’s adjusted asset management revenue between December 31, 2006 and closing. MMC expects the sale of Putnam to close in mid-2007.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.:

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),” effective December 31, 2006 and SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” effective July 1, 2005.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. MMC’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

MMC’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures relating to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of MMC; the recording of all necessary transactions to permit the preparation of MMC’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; the proper authorization of receipts and expenditures in accordance with authorizations of MMC’s management and directors; and the prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on MMC’s consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management evaluated the effectiveness of MMC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on its evaluation, management determined that MMC maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that audited and reported on MMC’s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, also issued an attestation report on management’s evaluation of the effectiveness of MMC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006.

Attestation of the Registered Public Accounting Firm.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.:

New York, New York

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.


We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s changes in accounting for pension and postretirement benefits and share-based payments.
