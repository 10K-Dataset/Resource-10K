¡

this segment through Kroll.

We describe our operating segments in further detail below. We provide financial information about our
segments in our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

OUR BUSINESSES

Risk and Insurance Services

Risk and Insurance Services, comprising

Marsh

and

Guy Carpenter

, is MMC’s largest business segment. This segment generated 47% of MMC’s total operating segment revenue in 2008 and employs approximately 26,900 colleagues worldwide.

Marsh

Marsh is a world leader in delivering risk
and insurance services and solutions to its clients. From its founding in 1871 to the present day, Marsh has provided thought leadership and innovation for clients and the insurance industry—introducing and promoting the concept and practice of
client representation through brokerage, the discipline of risk management, the globalization of insurance and risk management services and many other new tools and service platforms.



Marsh generated approximately 40% of MMC’s total operating segment revenue in 2008. More than 24,000 Marsh
colleagues provide risk management, risk consulting, insurance broking, alternative risk financing, and insurance program management services to a wide range of businesses, government entities and professional service organizations around the world
in more than 100 countries. Marsh’s clients vary by size, industry, geography and risk exposures.

Insurance Broking and Risk Consulting

In its main insurance broking and risk consulting business, Marsh employs a team approach to address clients’ risk management and insurance
needs. Each client relationship is coordinated by a client executive who draws from the many industry and risk specialties within Marsh to assemble the resources needed to analyze, measure and assist a client in managing its various risks. Product
and service offerings include program design and placement, post-placement program support and administration, claims advocacy, and a wide array of risk analysis and risk management consulting services. Services are organized and provided in three
distinct business segments: Large Organizations, Mid-Size Organizations and Small & Medium Enterprise Organizations.

Large
Organizations

.  Marsh’s Global Risk Management (GRM) Practice focuses on clients with a broad footprint, including U.S.-based entities with global operations or international companies with U.S. exposures and insurance program
elements. Generally, these clients have highly complex insurance and risk funding program needs, with a wide array of risk management consulting requirements. Marsh serves its more than 3,000 GRM clients using a global service model that provides
customized solutions embracing risk transfer, risk mitigation and risk retention brokerage and consulting services. GRM includes the Multinational Practice, which specializes in the delivery of all multinational products and services, with a
particular focus on programs that require the combination and coordination of global and local components. Colleagues in this practice specialize in understanding and prioritizing the local country and worldwide risk issues and needs of each
client’s business, such as those arising from the local regulatory and legal environment.

Mid-Size Organizations

.  Clients
served in this segment (known as “National Brokerage” in the United States) are mid-size firms whose needs vary depending on industry, size, geography and the competitive environment in which they operate. Many of these clients do not have
full-time risk managers and thus look to Marsh to provide the expertise, advice and solutions required by firms in their particular industries. Marsh colleagues help these clients develop tailored solutions for their operational and risk management
needs, and coordinate all client program service and support activities. Marsh brokers provide these clients with insurance program placement, ongoing technical advice, and management of insurance market relationships.

Small & Medium Enterprise Organizations.

The small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is the fastest growing segment of many economies
around the world, and its constituent organizations generally have special needs for efficient risk management. These clients demand service excellence and tend to rely heavily on programs and prepackaged products and solutions.

In 2008, Marsh established the Marsh & McLennan Agency to service small to middle market organizations that tend to be U.S.-based firms with little
overseas insurance needs. The Agency is targeted to customers who seek market knowledge, experience and expertise in a streamlined manner at competitive prices, and who do not require highly customized product adaptations. The Agency will offer
Commercial Property, Casualty, Directors & Officers Liability, Surety, Employee Benefits and Personal Lines products through a dedicated sales and service force in retail locations across the United States.



Risk, Specialty and Industry Practices

In further support of its clients’ strategic, operational and risk management objectives, Marsh provides consultative advice, brokerage and claims advocacy
services through dedicated global Risk, Specialty and Industry Practices in the areas listed below. For both large and mid-size organizations, Practice colleagues apply their hands-on working knowledge of clients’ industry sectors, and the
unique environments in which they operate, to help facilitate the requisite breadth of coverage and to reduce cost of risk.

Bowring Marsh

Bowring Marsh was established in 2008 to respond to clients’ growing needs and marketplace opportunity, specializing as an international placement broker for Property (including terrorism) and Casualty risks. Bowring Marsh
utilizes placement expertise in major international insurance market hubs (including Bermuda, Dublin, London, Miami, Singapore and Zurich) and an integrated global network to secure advantageous terms and conditions for its clients throughout the
world.

managing general agents and third party administrators) to hold an individual and/or company license from a governmental agency or self-regulatory organization. Some
jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locally-owned business entities; in this case, if MMC has no licensed subsidiary, we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction.

Beginning in January 2005, all European Union member states were required to implement the Insurance Mediation Directive. This Directive aims to
apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance intermediaries, including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence, financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance. As member states of
the European Union adopt regulations to comply with the Directive, our insurance intermediary operations in the European Union have become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements. In January 2005, as part of the implementation of the Directive
in the United Kingdom, the power and responsibilities of the Financial Services Authority, or FSA, were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the United Kingdom.

Insurance authorities in the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which MMC’s subsidiaries do business, including the FSA in the United Kingdom,
also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit
the types of investments that may be made with them.

Certain of MMC’s Risk and Insurance Services activities are governed by other regulatory
bodies, such as investment, securities and futures licensing authorities. In the United States, Marsh and Guy Carpenter use the services of MMC Securities Corp., a U.S.-registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, member FINRA/SIPC, primarily in
connection with investment banking-related services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions. Also in the United States, Marsh uses the services of Interlink Securities Corp., primarily in connection with variable insurance products.
Guy Carpenter provides advice on securities or investments in the European Union through MMC Securities (Europe) Ltd. (formerly GC Securities Ltd.), which is authorized and regulated by the FSA. Marsh receives investment management services in the
European Union from another MMC subsidiary, Marsh Investment Service Limited, which is also regulated by the FSA. MMC Securities Corp., Interlink Securities Corp. and MMC Securities (Europe) Ltd. are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of MMC.

In some jurisdictions, insurance-related taxes may be due either directly from clients or from the insurance broker. In the latter case, the broker
customarily looks to the client for payment.

Consulting

.

Certain of Mercer’s retirement-related consulting
services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries, including by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, in the United States and the FSA in the United Kingdom. In addition, the trustee services, investment
services (including advice to individuals on the investment of personal pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities) and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by Mercer and
its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions. The benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same
licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our Risk and Insurance Services businesses. In the United States, Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group use the services of MMC Securities Corp.
primarily in connection with the sale of retirement and employee benefit plans, and investment banking services, respectively.

Risk
Consulting & Technology

.  Certain of Kroll’s risk consulting and investigative activities are licensed and regulated at the federal, state and local level in the United States and abroad. Many of these activities also
involve the use of data from outside sources, including third party vendors and governmental records. As a result, changes in existing, or the implementation of new laws and regulations, particularly relating to privacy, could interfere with
Kroll’s historical access to and use of such data. Substance abuse testing laboratories operated by a Kroll subsidiary are certified on the federal level and licensed in a number of states.



Competitive Conditions

MMC faces strong competition in all of its businesses from providers of similar products and services. MMC also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and
retaining qualified employees. In addition to the discussion below, see “Risks Relating to MMC Generally –Competitive Risks,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

Risk and Insurance Services

.  MMC’s combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope. The principal bases
upon which our insurance and reinsurance businesses compete include the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. MMC encounters strong competition from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on
a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance
of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants, that provide risk-related services and products. Although the major global insurance brokerage firms against whom Marsh
competes have, like us, stopped using contingent commission arrangements, many specialist, regional and local firms have not done so. The continuing acceptance of contingent commission revenue by certain of Marsh’s competitors may provide them
greater pricing flexibility and put Marsh at a competitive disadvantage.

Certain insureds and groups of insureds have established
programs of self insurance (including captive insurance companies) as a supplement or alternative to third-party insurance, thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements. There are also many other providers of affinity group and
private client services, including specialized firms, insurance companies and other institutions.

The continuing impact of legal and regulatory
proceedings concerning our insurance brokerage operations also could affect Marsh’s competitive position. These proceedings are discussed in more detail in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of
this report. Please also read our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact under Part I, Item 1A (“Risk Factors”) below.

Consulting

.  MMC’s consulting and HR outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies, as well as regional and local firms.
These businesses compete generally on the basis of the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. Competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms, as well as consulting and outsourcing operations
affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms.

Mercer’s investment consulting and investment
management businesses face competition from many sources, including multi-manager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions.

In many cases, clients have the option of handling the services provided by Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group internally, without assistance from outside advisors.

Risk Consulting & Technology

.  In Risk Consulting and Technology, we face competition from local, regional, national and
international firms that provide similar services in the fields of accounting, investigative and security services, consulting and technology services. Kroll’s Consulting Services Group faces competition from local, regional, national and
international accounting firms who provide forensic accounting, litigation support and investigative services, as well as other specialist firms providing architectural engineering and security consulting services. Kroll’s Litigation Support
and Data Recovery and Background Screening businesses face competition from a variety of law firms, independent service providers and technology companies.

Item 1A.      Risk Factors

You should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report. These risks have the potential to materially
adversely affect MMC’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

RISKS RELATING TO MMC GENERALLY

Legal and Regulatory Issues

We are subject to legal
proceedings and other contingencies which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

As more fully described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report, we are subject to a number of legal
proceedings, regulatory actions and other contingencies. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or
annual period. In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on MMC by exposing us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of
personnel and management resources.

We are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “errors and omissions” claims.

MMC’s operating companies provide numerous brokerage, consulting, actuarial and other services for clients around the world. As a result of
these activities, we are subject to errors and omissions, or “E&O,” claims by clients and third parties who allege that they were damaged as a result of the operating company’s alleged failure to perform its services as expected,
such as those claims alleged in separate lawsuits by the Alaska Retirement Management Board and Milwaukee County against Mercer. Certain E&O claims seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant and
subject MMC, in addition to potential liability for monetary damages, to reputational harm and diversion of personnel and management resources. As described below, for certain policy years, we have limited third party insurance for E&O matters,
including the Alaska Retirement Management Board and Milwaukee County matters.

MMC has varying levels of third party insurance coverage against
E&O claims, depending on the policy year. To the extent that expected losses exceed MMC’s retention in any policy year, MMC records a liability and an asset for the amount that MMC expects to recover under its third-party insurance
programs. The policy limits and coverage terms of the third-party insurance vary to some extent by policy year, but MMC is not aware of coverage defenses or other obstacles to coverage that would limit recoveries in years prior to policy year
2001-2002 in a material amount.

In policy years subsequent to 2001-2002, the availability of third-party insurance has declined significantly, which
has caused MMC to assume increasing levels of self-insurance for its potential E&O exposures. MMC utilizes internal actuarial and other estimates, and case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, to establish loss reserves, in accordance
with SFAS No. 5 (“Accounting for Contingencies”), to provide for its loss retention. These reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. Nevertheless, given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of
litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on MMC’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.

Our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign
laws and regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.

Our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, the European Union and its member states, and the
other jurisdictions in which we



operate. For example, our insurance and reinsurance services activities, as well as certain of our consulting and related activities, in the United Kingdom are under
the jurisdiction of the Financial Services Authority. Compliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.
These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. While we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and
regulations, there can be no assurance that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able
to comply with any future laws, regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those referred to above, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or
civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, loss of an operating license or approval, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients. The cost of compliance or the consequences of
non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, these matters could have a material adverse effect on MMC by exposing us to negative publicity, reputational damage or harm to our client or
employee relationships.

In most jurisdictions, government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret or amend applicable laws and
regulations, and have discretion to grant, renew and revoke various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities. Such authorities may require MMC to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations.
In some areas of our businesses, we act on the basis of our own or the industry’s interpretations of applicable laws or regulations, which may conflict from state to state or country to country. In the event those interpretations eventually
prove different from those of regulatory authorities, we might be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities. Moreover, the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries
in which we provide services. Any significant impairment of our ability to conduct our business as we historically have done could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Finally, government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could displace insurance or reinsurance currently available from the private market and
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm
our reputation.

One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary
information and the personal data of their employees and retirement and other benefit plan participants. We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we
cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting
in increased costs or loss of revenue.

Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among
the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our
reputation in the marketplace.

International Operations

We are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations.

We do business worldwide. In 2008,
54 percent of MMC’s total operating segment revenue was generated from operations outside the United States, and over one-half of our employees are located abroad. We expect to expand our non-U.S. operations further.



The geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market and
reputational risks. These include, among others, risks relating to:

–

economic and political conditions in foreign countries, including the recent disruption in the global financial markets;

–

international hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters and infrastructure disruptions;

–

local investment or other financial restrictions that foreign governments may impose;

–

potential costs and difficulties in complying, or monitoring compliance, with rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the
requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or other U.S. laws and regulations applicable to business operations abroad;

–

limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries;

–

withholding or other taxes that foreign governments may impose on the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries;

–

potential transfer pricing-related tax exposures that may result from the allocation of U.S.-based costs that benefit our non-U.S. businesses;

–

the length of payment cycles and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, particularly in light of the increasing number of insolvencies in the current
economic environment and the numerous bankruptcy laws to which they are subject;

–

engaging and relying on third parties to perform services on behalf of MMC;

–

potential difficulties in monitoring employees in geographically dispersed locations; and

–

potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government agencies, some of
which may conflict with U.S. or other sources of law.

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or
other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made
disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an event, our
operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems would provide us with an important advantage. Nevertheless, we could still experience near-term operational challenges with regard to particular areas
of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel.

Our operations, particularly within our Consulting and Risk Consulting and Technology
segments, are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We could potentially lose client data or experience
material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario.

We regularly assess and take
steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover
should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or
legal liability.



Competitive Risks

Each of MMC’s businesses operates in a highly competitive environment. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and results of operations will suffer.

As a global professional services firm, MMC experiences acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments. Our ability to compete successfully
depends on a variety of factors, including our geographic reach, the sophistication and quality of our services, and our pricing relative to our competitors. If we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face, our business and
results of operations will suffer.

In our Risk and Insurance Services segment, we compete intensely against two other major global brokerage firms,
Aon and Willis, for both client business and employee talent. We also face competition from a wide range of other insurance brokerage firms that operate on a regional, national or local scale; many of these firms, unlike Marsh, Aon and Willis, have
not stopped accepting contingent commissions, and thus may have greater pricing flexibility than we do. We compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or
other market intermediaries, and with various other companies that provide risk-related services. The above competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a “syndicated” or “distributed” approach to the purchase of
insurance brokerage services, whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client’s account.

In our Consulting
and Risk Consulting and Technology segments, we compete for business and employee talent with numerous independent consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms around the
world. Kroll also competes with law firms for certain of its services.

The loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing
client revenues and generate revenues from new business.

Across all of our businesses, our personnel are crucial to developing and retaining the
client relationships on which our revenues depend. It is therefore very important for us to retain significant revenue-producing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them. We face numerous challenges in this regard,
including:

–

the intense competition for talent in all of our businesses;

–

the general mobility of professionals in our businesses; and

–

the difficulties we may face in offering compensation of a type and amount (including equity-based compensation) sufficient to attract, motivate and retain valuable
employees.

Losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise
could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company, some
of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services.

Consolidation in the industries that we serve could
adversely affect our business.

Particularly in the current economic environment, companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve
economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations, it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients. If
one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work. The increased market power of larger companies
could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us. Any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business. Guy Carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance
company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace.



Our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these
changes could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

To remain competitive in many of our business areas, we must identify the
most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings. For example, Guy Carpenter’s risk-modeling services are increasingly dependent on implementing advanced software and data-compilation tools; Kroll’s
e-discovery business depends on advanced search technology and computerized document processing; and Mercer’s ability to price its outsourcing services competitively is highly dependent on the efficient and cost effective use of technology. If
we do not make the correct technology choices or investments, or if our choices or investments are insufficiently prompt or cost-effective, our business and results of operations could suffer.

Financial Risks

Our results of operations could be
adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity.

Global economic and political conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve. Recently, the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil
and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and foreign governments. These economic conditions have resulted in negative
impacts on businesses and financial institutions, and financial services entities in particular. The current global economic crisis is having a significant effect on our Consulting and Risk Consulting and Technology segments in particular. Many of
our clients have been reducing expenses, including amounts they spend on consulting services.

If these economic conditions persist or deteriorate, they could potentially have a significant impact on our operations.

These economic conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations. Changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Should it become necessary for
us to further restructure our business, including reducing our work force, as a result of these market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services, our ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely
affected.

Financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt
capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations, investing activities (including the financing of any future acquisitions), or financing activities.

Our cash investments, including those held in a fiduciary capacity, are subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the recent global financial crisis. If the banking system
or the fixed income, credit or equity markets continue to deteriorate or remain volatile, the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected.

Our significant non-U.S. operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business.

We are subject to exchange rate risk because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies, and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Our U.S.
operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in U.S. dollars. In certain jurisdictions (primarily the United Kingdom), however, our Risk and Insurance Services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies, but expenses are
almost entirely incurred in local currency. Due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations. Exchange rate risk could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.



Changes in interest rates and increased counterparty risk could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and
adversely affect our financial condition or results.

The recent failures, bankruptcies, rescues and distressed acquisitions of previously highly
rated financial institutions indicate a possibly dramatic realignment of companies in the financial services sector and reflect the market’s lack of a clear understanding of the financial health of financial institutions. Many widely-held
investments previously rated investment grade have declined in value precipitously and unexpectedly in recent months, resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors. In order to avoid these risks, investors
have favored securities issued, guaranteed or supported by the U.S. or international governments, which has resulted in reduced yields on these and other investments considered to be lower risk. Although we generally employ a conservative investment
strategy with respect to our cash investments, including those held in a fiduciary capacity, we may incur investment losses as a result of these unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may experience reduced investment earnings if the
yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline further in this time of economic uncertainty.

Credit rating downgrades would
increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk.

Both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s downgraded
MMC’s senior debt credit rating in late 2004 and S&P announced a further downgrade in December 2007. Currently, MMC’s senior debt is rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB- by S&P. These ratings are the next-to-lowest investment grade
rating for Moody’s, and the lowest investment-grade rating for S&P.

If we need to raise capital in the future (for example, in order to fund
maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives), any further credit rating downgrade would increase our financing costs, and could limit our access to financing sources. Further, we believe that a downgrade to a rating below
investment-grade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures.

Our pension
obligations may cause MMC’s earnings and cash flows to fluctuate.

MMC has significant pension obligations to its current and former
employees, totaling approximately $8.5 billion at December 31, 2008. The magnitude of our worldwide pension plans means that our earnings are comparatively sensitive to factors such as equity and bond market returns, the assumed interest rates
we use to discount our pension liabilities, rates of inflation and mortality assumptions. Variations in any of these factors could cause significant fluctuation in our earnings from year to year and may result in increased levels of contributions to
our pension plans.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

We face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses.

We have a history of making acquisitions, including our $1.9 billion
acquisition of Kroll in July 2004 and a total of 44 acquisitions in the period 2005-2008 for aggregate purchase consideration of $593 million. We have also exited various businesses, including the sale of Putnam in August 2007 and the divestiture of
three separate restructuring businesses – one in the U.S. and two in the U.K. – in 2008. We expect that targeted acquisitions and dispositions will continue to be part of our business strategy. Our success in this regard will depend on our
ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue.

While we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations.
Acquisitions involve special risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit or
productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect. In addition, if the operating performance of an acquired business deteriorates significantly, we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible
assets recorded on our balance sheet. Given the significant size of



MMC’s goodwill and intangible assets, a write-down of this sort could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period. As of
December 31, 2008, MMC’s consolidated balance sheet reflected $7.2 billion of goodwill and intangible assets, representing approximately 47 percent of MMC’s total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows: Risk
and Insurance Services, $3.7 billion; Consulting, $2 billion; and Risk Consulting and Technology, $1.1 billion.

When we dispose of businesses we
are subject to the risk, contractually agreed or otherwise, of post-transaction liabilities. For example, as described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report, we have retained certain
contingent litigation liabilities relating to Putnam.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR RISK AND INSURANCE SERVICES SEGMENT

Our Risk and Insurance Services segment, conducted through Marsh and Guy Carpenter, represented 47 percent of MMC’s total operating segment revenue in 2008.
Our business in this segment is subject to particular risks.

Volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede
our ability to improve revenues and profitability.

A significant portion of our Risk and Insurance Services revenue consists of commissions paid
to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a
particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.

In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative
methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs. This trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “self-insure;” the use of so-called “captive” insurers; and the advent of capital markets-based
solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs.

We may not be as successful as we hope in implementing Marsh’s evolving business
model and otherwise coping with changing modes of compensation in the insurance brokerage industry.

In late 2004, Marsh made significant changes
to its business model, including the elimination of market service/contingent commission agreements with insurers. The elimination of market service revenue has negatively affected our financial results. In 2004, we recognized market service revenue
of $516 million, relating to insurance placements made before October 1, 2004. By contrast, in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively, we recognized $114 million, $43 million, $3 million and $1.7 million of market service revenue relating to
placements made before October 1, 2004. In addition to lost revenue, Marsh has and will likely continue to incur significant costs to ensure compliance with this business model and to provide disclosure relating thereto.

Although other large insurance brokers have similarly terminated the use of contingent commission agreements, many specialist, regional and local insurance brokers
have not. To date, there has been no regulatory action to end the use of contingent commission arrangements throughout the brokerage industry, and it is therefore unclear to what extent many of our competitors will continue to accept contingent
commission revenue. It is possible that Marsh will continue indefinitely to suffer competitive disadvantage compared to the brokers that have not given up the use of contingent commission arrangements. If that occurs, Marsh would continue to face
pressure on its revenues, operating margin and market share.



In addition to the possibility of continued competitive disadvantage as described above, Marsh faces risks relating
to the implementation of its new business model. Marsh is currently seeking to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that are disclosed to its clients, and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of
value-added risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities. Marsh’s current business and compensation model continues to evolve and in some respects remains untested, including Marsh’s creation of placement hubs and the
launch of Marsh & McLennan Agency for the small and emerging growth sector. We cannot be certain that it will generate the profitable revenue growth we are targeting. The inability to derive adequate revenues from Marsh’s current
business and compensation model may significantly impede improvement in our operating results and profitability.

Results in our Risk and
Insurance Services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity.

Demand for many types of insurance and
reinsurance generally rises and falls as economic growth expands or slows. This dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by Marsh and Guy Carpenter. To the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business
conditions, they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage, as applicable, which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue; and may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services, which would inhibit
our ability to generate fee revenue. Moreover, a growing number of insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business
through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Guy Carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR CONSULTING AND RISK CONSULTING AND TECHNOLOGY SEGMENTS

Our Consulting segment, conducted through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, represented 45 percent of our total operating segment revenue in 2008. Our Risk Consulting and Technology segment, conducted through Kroll, represented 9
percent of our total operating segment revenue in 2008. Our businesses in these two segments are subject to particular risks.

Demand for our
services might decrease for various reasons, including a general economic downturn, a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition, or changes in government regulation.

Our Consulting and Risk Consulting and Technology segments have historically achieved significant annual revenue growth. Despite this history, however, the current
global economic conditions have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions, and financial services entities in particular. Many of our clients, especially in the financial services industry, have been reducing expenses,
including amounts spent on consulting services. The evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients may challenge our ability to increase revenues and profitability and reduce demand for our services. If the economy or markets in which we
operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, demand for many of Mercer’s benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules, which drive our clients’ needs for
benefits-related services. For example, significant changes in government regulations affecting the value, use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans, defined
contribution plans, or defined benefit plans, may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of Mercer’s services.



Our profitability may suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for
our consultants.

The profitability of our Consulting and Risk Consulting and Technology businesses depends in part on ensuring that our
consultants maintain adequate utilization rates (i.e., the percentage of our consultants’ working hours devoted to billable activities). Our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors, including:

–

our ability to transition consultants promptly from completed projects to new assignments, and to engage newly hired consultants quickly in revenue-generating activities;

–

our ability to continually secure new business engagements, particularly because a portion of our work is project-based rather than recurring in nature;

–

our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and workforces;

–

our ability to manage attrition;

–

unanticipated changes in the scope of client engagements;

–

the potential for conflicts of interest that might require us to decline client engagements that we otherwise would have accepted;

–

our need to devote time and resources to sales, training, professional development and other non-billable activities; and

–

general economic conditions.

The factors listed above,
and therefore also our utilization rates for service personnel, have been adversely affected by recent macroeconomic conditions. If the utilization rate for our consulting professionals continues to decline, our profit margin and profitability would
suffer.

In addition, the profitability of our Consulting and Risk Consulting and Technology businesses depends on the prices we are able to charge
for our services. Our pricing power is affected by a number of factors, including:

–

clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services;

–

market demand for the services we provide;

–

our ability to develop new services and the introduction of new services by competitors;

–

the pricing policies of our competitors;

–

changes in the extent to which our clients develop in-house or other capabilities to perform the services that they might otherwise purchase from us; and

–

general economic conditions.

Our pricing has also been
adversely affected by the current economic crisis. If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our consultants, our profit margin and profitability could suffer.

Our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly.

Quarterly variations in revenues and operating
results at Mercer, Oliver Wyman Group and Kroll may occur due to several factors. These include:

–

the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter;

–

the unpredictability of the timing and amount of success fees;

–

the possibility that clients may decide to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress;



–

fluctuations in consultant hiring and utilization rates and clients’ ability to terminate engagements without penalty;

–

seasonality at Mercer due to the impact of regulatory deadlines and other timing factors to which our clients are subject;

–

the success of our strategic acquisitions, alliances or investments;

–

macroeconomic factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and global securities markets; and

–

general economic conditions, since results of operations in our Consulting and Risk Consulting and Technology businesses are directly affected by the levels of business
activity of our clients, which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve.

A significant portion of total operating expenses at Mercer, Oliver Wyman Group and Kroll is relatively fixed. Therefore, a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client
assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses.

If we are unable to collect our receivables or
unbilled services, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Our business depends on our ability to successfully
obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed. We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the
creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could
increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. The increasing number of insolvencies in the current economic environment and the numerous bankruptcy laws to which they are subject could also adversely affect our
ability to collect receivables or unbilled services. Timely collection of client balances depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual
requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience an increase in the
time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.

Acceleration of the shift by employers from defined
benefit plans to defined contribution plans could adversely affect Mercer’s operating results.

Mercer currently provides clients with
actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Defined benefit pension plans generally require more services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large
asset pools, complex calculations to determine employer costs, funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match liabilities and assets over long periods of time. Recent regulatory initiatives in the United States and certain European
countries may result in companies either discontinuing or curtailing defined benefit programs in favor of defined contribution plans. If organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate and we do not successfully
adjust our service offerings to take account of that change, Mercer’s operating results could be adversely affected.

Item 2.      Properties.

MMC and its subsidiaries maintain their corporate headquarters in and around New York City. We also maintain other offices around the world, primarily in leased
space. In certain circumstances, we may have space that we sublet to third parties, depending upon our needs in particular locations.

MMC and certain
of its subsidiaries own, directly and indirectly through special-purpose subsidiaries, a 55% condominium interest covering approximately 900,000 square feet in a 44-story building in New York City. MMC’s owned interest is financed by a loan
that is non-recourse to MMC (except in the event of certain prohibited actions) and secured by a first mortgage lien on the condominium interest and a first priority assignment of leases and rents. In the event of a default in the payment of the
loan and certain credit rating downgrade events, MMC would be obligated to pay rent for the entire occupancy of the mortgaged property.

See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, appearing under Part II, Item 7 of this report, for discussion of significant
items affecting our results of operations in 2008, 2007 and 2006.



Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.

General

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and
Subsidiaries (“MMC”) is a global professional services firm providing advice and solutions in the areas of risk, strategy, and human capital. MMC’s subsidiaries include Marsh, which provides Risk and Insurance Services; Guy Carpenter,
which provides reinsurance services; Mercer, which provides human resource and related financial advice and services; Oliver Wyman Group, which provides management consulting and other services and Kroll, which provides risk consulting and
technology services. MMC’s approximately 54,000 employees worldwide provide analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in over 100 countries.

MMC’s business segments are based on the services provided. Risk and Insurance Services includes risk management and insurance and reinsurance broking and services, provided primarily by Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Consulting, which
comprises the activities of Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, includes human resource consulting and related investment and outsourcing services, and specialized management, economic and brand consulting services. Risk Consulting & Technology,
conducted through Kroll, includes risk consulting and related investigative, intelligence, financial, security and technology services. During the fourth quarter of 2008, MMC disposed of its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses to their respective
management teams in separate leveraged buyouts.

We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of
segment financial results. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are
the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements.

This MD&A contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the outset of this report.



Consolidated Results of Operations

Consolidated operating income was $263 million in 2008 compared with $846 million in the prior year. The 2008 results include
the negative impact of a $540 million goodwill impairment charge related to the Risk Consulting & Technology segment and restructuring related items of $388 million in 2008, including the $28 million loss on the sale of the U.K. restructuring
businesses, compared with restructuring costs of $105 million in 2007. Excluding these charges, consolidated operating income was $1.2 billion in 2008 compared with $951 million in 2007.

Risk and Insurance Services operating income increased $118 million to $460 million in 2008 compared with 2007, or 35%, despite an increase of $149 million in restructuring and related charges.

Consulting’s operating income decreased $51 million to $555 million in 2008. Restructuring and related charges in 2008 at Mercer were $40 million compared with $8 million of
such charges recorded in 2007.

Risk Consulting & Technology incurred an operating loss of $497 million in 2008 compared with $98 million of operating income in
2007. Operating results in 2008 include the $540 million goodwill impairment charge, restructuring and related charges of $17 million and a loss on the disposal of its U.K. restructuring businesses of $28 million. There were no similar charges
recognized in this segment in 2007.

Corporate expenses increased $55 million to $255 million in 2008. In 2008, corporate expenses include $85 million of
restructuring and related charges primarily resulting from estimated future rent and other real estate costs to exit space in MMC’s New York headquarters building and previously vacated space in the U.K. and other locations. Restructuring and
related charges were $28 million in 2007.

The consolidated net loss was $73 million in 2008, which includes charges of $928 million related to the goodwill
impairment and restructuring and related charges, compared with net income of $2.5 billion in the prior year. Results for 2007 include a $1.9 billion gain on the disposal of Putnam, partly offset by restructuring and related charges of $105 million.

Discontinued operations in 2007 primarily includes the gain on disposal of Putnam.



Consolidated Revenues and Expenses

MMC
conducts business in many countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may impact period-to-period
comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions on MMC’s operating revenues by
segment is as follows:

*

Marsh’s revenue growth and underlying revenue growth were 3.6% and 2.4%, respectively. The columns do not add due to rounding.





Revenue

Consolidated revenue for 2008
increased 4% to $11.6 billion compared with $11.2 billion in 2007, reflecting a 2% increase in underlying revenue, a 1% increase from acquisitions and a 1% positive impact of foreign currency translation.

Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 1% compared with 2007. Underlying revenue growth was flat for the total Risk and Insurance Services segment, reflecting
a 2% increase in Marsh, offset by a 7% decrease in Guy Carpenter, and a 23% decrease in fiduciary interest income. Consulting revenue increased 6%, resulting from an 8% increase at Mercer and 2% growth at Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis,
revenue increased 4% reflecting a 7% increase in Mercer, and a decrease of 2% in Oliver Wyman Group. Revenue increased 1% in Risk Consulting & Technology, but decreased 3% on an underlying basis. During the fourth quarter of 2008, MMC
disposed of its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses, which are included in the Risk Consulting & Technology segment.

In 2007, Risk and Insurance Services
revenue increased 3% compared with 2006. Underlying revenue decreased 1% for the total Risk and Insurance Services segment, reflecting a 1% decrease in Marsh, which includes a $40 million decrease in market service revenue, partly offset by a 1%
increase in Guy Carpenter and a 2% increase in fiduciary interest income. Consulting revenue increased 16%, resulting from a 12% increase in Mercer’s businesses and 26% growth in Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 7%
in Mercer, 18% in Oliver Wyman Group and 10% for the Consulting segment in total. Revenue increased 1% in Risk Consulting & Technology, but growth was flat on an underlying basis.

Expenses

Consolidated operating expenses in 2008 increased 10%, which included the $540
million goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2008 and a $283 million increase from restructuring and related charges in 2008 as compared with 2007. Excluding these two items, expenses decreased 4% in 2008 compared with 2007 and were essentially
flat on an underlying basis.

Consolidated operating expenses in 2007 increased 10% compared with 2006. Operating expenses increased 5% on an underlying basis in
2007 compared with 2006. The increase in underlying expenses was due to higher compensation and benefit costs driven by the Consulting segment due to increased volume across all practices, increased advertising, primarily in insurance services, and
favorable professional liability experience in 2006.

Restructuring and Related Activities

Actions Initiated in 2008

In 2008, MMC implemented restructuring actions which resulted in costs totaling $312 million primarily related
to severance and benefits costs and the loss on the disposal of our U.K. restructuring businesses. These costs were incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance Services—$218 million, Consulting—$40 million, Risk Consulting &
Technology—$45 million, and Corporate—$9 million. These activities resulted in the elimination of approximately 1,660 positions at Marsh, 360 positions at Guy Carpenter, 490 positions at Mercer, 300 positions in Risk Consulting &
Technology and 85 positions at Corporate. In addition, Marsh outsourced approximately 700 positions as part of its U.K. back office outsourcing initiative. The annualized cost savings from these actions are expected to be approximately $290 million.
MMC expects to incur additional restructuring charges in the first half of 2009.

Actions Initiated Prior to 2008

In 2008, MMC recorded $76 million of restructuring charges related to actions initiated in prior years, primarily due to a charge of $62 million for estimated future rent and real
estate costs to exit five floors in MMC’s New York headquarters building that was part of the restructuring plan announced in 2006, and $11 million related to changes in the estimated costs for future rent related to previously vacated
properties in the U.K. and other locations. These amounts were recorded in Corporate.



Putnam Transaction

On August 3,
2007, Great-West Lifeco Inc. completed its purchase of Putnam Investments Trust for $3.9 billion in cash. The gain on disposal and Putnam’s results of operations through the date of sale, are included in discontinued operations in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, MMC provided certain indemnities related to the transaction, and also has established liabilities for uncertain tax positions. As these
issues are resolved, or as facts and circumstances related to these issues change in the future, the related liabilities will be adjusted and will be recorded in discontinued operations.

Other Businesses Exited

During the fourth quarter of 2008, MMC sold its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses to their respective
management teams in separate leveraged buyouts. Based on the terms and conditions of the disposals, MMC determined it has “continuing involvement” in these businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. MMC
recorded a loss of $28 million on the disposition of the U.K. Corporate Advisory and Restructuring businesses. The net assets of these U.K. businesses were written-off upon transfer to the new owners. MMC will receive royalties on future revenue of
these businesses over the next four years. The royalties will be recognized when earned under the terms of the contract and when collectibility is reasonably assured. The transfer of the U.S. restructuring business was financed with a seller note.
If MMC receives interest and principal payments as scheduled for the U.S. business, it will recover the value of the net assets transferred to the new owners and recognize a gain on the disposal of $18 million.

Risk and Insurance Services

In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, MMC’s
subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the
name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.

Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount
depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the
insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by
insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the types and amounts of risks to be analyzed by MMC and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of
revenue from one period to the next will therefore be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and
the volume of business from new and existing clients.

Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in
a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with
them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is now segregated within the segment
from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter, as shown in the charts on pages 29 and 30.



The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below:

Revenue

Revenue in Risk and
Insurance Services increased 1% in 2008 compared with 2007, reflecting the positive impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and was flat on an underlying basis.

In Marsh, revenue increased 4% from last year, reflecting a 1% positive impact of currency translation and a 2% increase in underlying revenue. Client revenue retention increased by 3 percentage points over 2007. New business production
also remained strong. On a geographic basis, Marsh’s international revenue increased 6% while the U.S. and Canada increased 1% compared with 2007.

Guy Carpenter
revenue decreased 6% in 2008 compared with 2007 or 7% on an underlying basis. Reinsurance premium rates declined during the year across most coverages.

Fiduciary
interest income decreased 22% in 2008, or 23% on an underlying basis, primarily due to lower interest rates, and to a lesser extent, lower average invested funds.

Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services increased 3% in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting the positive impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations partly offset by a decrease in underlying revenue.

Expense

Expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 1% in 2008
compared with the prior year, reflecting a 2% decrease in underlying expenses, partly offset by a 1% increase related to the impact of foreign exchange. The reduction in compensation and benefits expense in 2008 compared with 2007 reflects a
reduction in headcount during the year and a decline in benefits expenses partly offset by increased incentive compensation costs and higher severance costs at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. The decrease in other expenses reflects the continued focus
on expense control and primarily relate to reductions in travel, entertainment, meetings, and marketing and advertising. These decreases were partly offset by higher restructuring and related costs in 2008 compared with 2007, and a $33 million
charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to a professional liability claim.

In 2007, expenses in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 6% over the
prior year. The increase in expenses reflected higher salary costs due to increased headcount during the second half of the year; the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations; costs associated with Marsh’s advertising campaign initiated
in the spring of 2007; incremental expenses related to the departure of Marsh’s former CEO; and the effect of favorable professional liability experience in 2006. These increases were partly offset by lower restructuring and related costs
compared with 2006 and reduced incentive compensation accruals.

Consulting

MMC conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer includes practice groups specializing in retirement, health and benefits, outsourcing, and investment consulting and management. Oliver Wyman Group
provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services.

The major component of Consulting’s revenue, in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group,
is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health & benefits line of business, also



earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily
life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s outsourcing businesses consists principally of fees based on assets under administration.

Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is
also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the
provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance.

The results
of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below:

2008 increased 6% compared with 2007 comprising 8% growth at Mercer and 2% growth at Oliver Wyman Group. Revenue for the segment increased 4% on an underlying basis. Within Mercer, the revenue increase of 8% reflects growth in retirement of 9%,
health and benefits of 9%, other consulting lines of 9%, outsourcing of 3% and investment consulting & management of 14%. Mercer’s revenue grew 7% on an underlying basis. Oliver Wyman Group grew 2%, but decreased 2% on an underlying
basis, compared with the same period last year.

Consulting revenue in 2007 increased 16% compared with 2006. Revenue for Mercer increased 12%, or 7% on an underlying
basis driven by strong growth throughout its businesses. Oliver Wyman Group revenues grew 26%, or 18% on an underlying basis, compared with the same period in 2006.

Expense

Consulting expenses increased 8% in 2008 compared with 2007, or 6% on an underlying basis. Compensation and benefit costs increased due to a
higher volume of activity at Mercer, largely in the first three quarters of the year. As part of its ongoing effort to realize operational efficiencies, Mercer reduced its headcount in the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in a $40 million
restructuring charge. The increase in other operating expenses reflects a $70 million increase resulting from expenses that are reimbursable by clients.

Consulting
expenses increased 14% in 2007 compared with 2006, reflecting higher compensation costs due to an increased volume of business, higher incentive compensation commensurate with improved operating performance and the impact of foreign currency
translation.

Risk Consulting & Technology

MMC’s Risk
Consulting & Technology segment which comprises the activity of Kroll and Corporate Advisory and Restructuring, includes risk consulting, and related investigative, intelligence, financial, security and technology services.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, MMC sold its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts. Based on the terms and
conditions of the disposals, MMC determined it has “continuing involvement” in these businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. MMC recorded a loss of $28 million on the disposition



of the U.K. restructuring businesses. The net assets of the U.K. businesses were written-off upon transfer to the new owners. MMC will receive royalties on future
revenue of these businesses over the next four years. The royalties will be recognized when earned under the terms of the contract and when collectibility is reasonably assured. The transfer of the U.S. restructuring business was financed with a
seller note. If MMC receives interest and principal payments as scheduled for the U.S. business, it will recover the value of the net assets transferred to the new owners and recognize a gain on the disposal of $18 million.

Kroll receives compensation primarily in the form of fees paid by clients. These fees are typically earned on an hourly, project, fixed fee or per-unit basis. Kroll’s revenue
is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions, including the levels of mortgage applications and new employment. Kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures, demand for professional staff
and new product development on the part of competitors, particularly in technology services.

The results of operations for the Risk Consulting & Technology
segment are presented below:

Revenue

Risk Consulting &
Technology revenues increased 1% compared with 2007, but decreased 3% on an underlying basis. Revenue in Kroll’s litigation support and data recovery and risk mitigation and response businesses increased 6% and 12%, respectively, on an
underlying basis compared with 2007. Revenues in Kroll’s background screening business decreased 11% due to declines in both employment and mortgage related background screening. Corporate Advisory and Restructuring revenue was $127 million in
2008, compared with $172 million in 2007. Due to the disposal of the U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses, future results will only include revenue earned by MMC under the royalty arrangements discussed earlier.

Risk Consulting & Technology revenues increased 1% in 2007 compared with 2006, and were flat on an underlying basis. Revenue in Kroll’s litigation support and data
recovery and background screening increased 14% and 5%, respectively, on an underlying basis compared with 2006. This was offset by a 23% decrease in Corporate Advisory and Restructuring revenue due to weaker demand for these services, including
lower client success fees, for completed engagements compared with 2006.

Expense

Risk Consulting & Technology expenses in 2008 increased 68% compared with 2007. Expenses in 2008 included the $540 million goodwill impairment charge, restructuring charges of $17 million and the $28 million loss on the disposal of
the U.K. restructuring businesses. Excluding these items, Risk Consulting & Technology expenses for 2008 increased 2% compared with 2007 and were essentially the same as last year on an underlying basis.

Risk Consulting & Technology expenses increased 7% in 2007 compared with 2006. Approximately half of the increase results from acquisitions and the impact of foreign
currency fluctuation. The remaining increase reflects higher compensation in the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring and the



background screening businesses, as well as increased costs for outside services in the background screening business due to a higher volume of business. In addition,
expenses in 2006 included a credit related to the early termination of a licensing agreement.

Discontinued Operations

Results of discontinued operations in 2008 include the effects of three discontinued operations –Putnam, Mediservice and Kroll Crucible – which are discussed in more
detail below.

With regard to Putnam, discontinued operations in 2008 includes (1) the impact of immaterial corrections and other adjustments to the fourth
quarter of 2007 tax provision related to the transaction, (2) adjustments to the tax provision to reflect differences between tax returns filed in 2008 and the initial estimated provisions, and (3) interest on liabilities for certain
tax-related indemnities provided as part of the transaction. In the first quarter of 2008, Marsh completed the sale of Mediservice, a claims administration operation in Brazil. The gain on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued
operations in 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, Kroll completed the sale of Kroll Crucible (“Crucible”), a division of its government services operation. The loss on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in
2008.

In 2007, discontinued operations include the gain on the sale of Putnam, as well as Putnam’s operating income through August 2, 2007 and, in 2006,
include the operating income from Putnam, Sedgwick Claims Management Services (“SCMS”), Kroll Security International (“KSI”) and Price Forbes. Discontinued operations in 2006 also include the gain on disposal of SCMS and a charge
to reduce the carrying value of Price Forbes’ assets to fair value.

The following depicts the results of discontinued operations including revenue and expense
detail for Putnam:



Corporate Items

Corporate Expenses

Corporate expenses were $255 million in 2008, compared to $200 million in 2007. In 2008, expenses include $85 million of restructuring and related charges comprising a $62 million
charge related to estimated future rent and other real estate costs to exit five floors in MMC’s New York headquarters building and previously vacated space in the U.K. and other locations. In 2007, restructuring and related items were $28
million. Expenses in 2008 include a $10 million credit for a payment from U.S. Investigative Services, Inc. (“USIS”) in connection with the hiring of MMC’s former CEO, partly offset by costs related to the departure of several senior
executives.

Corporate expenses were $200 million in 2007, compared to $137 million in 2006. In 2007, corporate expenses included $28 million for restructuring and
related charges, including a credit from an accrual adjustment related to the separation of former MMC senior executives, compared with a credit of $31 million of such items in 2006 that included a $74 million gain on the sale of five floors in
MMC’s headquarters building. In 2007, corporate expenses also included incremental costs of $14 million related to the departure of MMC’s former CEO.

Interest

Corporate interest income decreased from $95 million in 2007 to $48 million in 2008. The decrease primarily reflects the combined effect of
lower average interest rates and a lower level of invested balances in 2008 compared with the prior year. The invested balances in the second half of 2007 were higher primarily due to proceeds received from the Putnam transaction, which were
subsequently used to repurchase MMC shares, pay down debt and pay taxes on the gain on the disposal. Interest expense of $220 million in 2008 decreased from $267 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense is due to a decrease in the average
level of debt outstanding compared to the prior year.

Interest income earned on corporate funds was $95 million in 2007, an increase of $35 million over 2006. The
increase in interest income reflects generally higher average interest rates in 2007 compared with 2006, and higher invested balances during the second half of the year resulting from the receipt of proceeds from the Putnam transaction, discussed
above. Interest expense of $267 million in 2007 decreased from $303 million from 2006. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in the average level of debt compared with the prior year.

Investment Income (Loss)

In 2008, investment losses were $12 million, primarily due to
mark-to-market declines on Risk Capital Holding’s private equity investments. This compared with $173 million of gains in the prior period, primarily related to mark-to-market gains on private equity fund investments and gains from the sale of
investments.

Income Taxes

MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate in
2008 was significantly impacted by the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge. The 2007 consolidated effective tax rate of 34.9% primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of international tax law changes in 2007.

MMC’s consolidated effective tax rate was 34.9% in 2007 compared to 29.8% in 2006. The change primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of international tax law changes in
2007 and the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in 2006.

The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of
MMC’s earnings, which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate. This also could result in foreign tax credit carryforwards arising in future periods for which a valuation allowance may be required. Furthermore, losses in certain
jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may result in the need for valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which would affect the rate.



In 2007, MMC adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each
reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment resulting from new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or
expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. Such adjustments could have a material impact on MMC’s effective tax rate, net income, and cash flows in a particular future period. It is reasonably possible that the
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease between zero and approximately $135 million within the next 12 months due to settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

MMC’s liquidity needs are primarily for operating
expenses, capital expenditures, servicing debt, funding pension obligations, paying dividends on outstanding stock and funding acquisitions. As a holding company, MMC’s primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from operating
subsidiaries. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.

Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds
available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general
corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for MMC.

Operating Cash Flows

MMC generated $837 million of cash from operations in 2008 compared with a use of cash of $385 million in 2007. These amounts reflect the net income (loss) reported by MMC during
those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments and the disposition of businesses, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of
assets. Cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows. Payment of accrued liabilities in 2008 includes approximately $170 million for regulatory settlements. This represents the final payment related to the
settlement with the NYAG and NYSID as discussed in Note 16 and is consistent with the amount paid in 2007. In 2007, cash outflows included tax payments of $933 million related to the disposition of businesses, primarily Putnam. Although the cash
proceeds from the Putnam transaction are included in investing cash flows, SFAS 95 specifies that the related payment of taxes be included in operating cash flows and not allocated to other cash flow categories.

MMC’s expected funding for its U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans in 2009 is approximately $21 million and $370 million, respectively. MMC’s policy for funding
its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign law. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified
plan for 2008 or 2009. Funding requirements for non-U.S. plans vary by country. Contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset
performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of
MMC’s cash flows, including dividends, investments and share repurchases.

During 2008, MMC’s defined benefit pension plans were negatively impacted by the
severe downturn in the global equity markets. Defined benefit assets experienced market declines of approximately 18% in the U.S. and approximately 14% in the U.K., our largest plan.

Pension liabilities are largely dependent on the discount rate set as of year end. In the U.S., interest rates declined dramatically over the last two months of 2008, resulting in a lower year-end discount rate than the prior
year end. This contributed to a $300 million increase in the projected benefit



obligation for the U.S. plans. While our U.S. plans show a funding deficit as of the end of 2008, no contributions to the U.S. plan are required in 2009.

Due to an increase in the discount rate and a reduction in inflation expectations, our U.K. plan liabilities decreased slightly in local currency terms in 2008. Although we make
scheduled contributions to the U.K. plan throughout the year, in January 2009, we made a discretionary pension contribution of $70 million to the plan. We expect to contribute a similar amount in the second quarter of 2009. These contributions are
included in the $370 million of expected contributions noted above. Overall, MMC’s aggregate pension expense in 2009 will be similar to that of 2008.

During
2008, MMC contributed approximately $20 million to the U.S. pension plans and $250 million to the significant non-U.S. pension plans, compared with $20 million for U.S. plans and $189 million for significant non-U.S. plans in 2007.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires that MMC recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree
medical plans (the “Plans”) as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded Plans as a net benefit plan liability. The offsetting adjustment to the amount of assets and liabilities required to be recognized is recorded in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, net of tax, in MMC’s 2006 year-end balance sheet. Subsequent changes in the funded status are recognized through the income statement and other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur as
appropriate. MMC adopted the provisions of SFAS 158, prospectively, on December 31, 2006. The impact of adopting SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction in assets of $660 million and an increase in liabilities of $245 million, including a related
adjustment to tax benefits of $423 million. The net impact of adopting SFAS 158 was a reduction of MMC’s stockholders’ equity of $905 million in 2006 (or $804 million including an adjustment for the impact of recording a reduction to the
minimum pension liability prior to the adoption of SFAS 158). In 2007, the improved funded status of the Plans resulted in a net increase to equity of $708 million. In 2008, the decrease in the funded status of the Plans resulted in a net decrease
to equity of $988 million. The change in funded status of the Plans is impacted by numerous items, including actual results compared with prior estimates and assumptions, contributions to the Plans, and changes in assumptions to reflect information
available at the respective measurement dates. Significant items impacting the funded status of the U.S. and U.K. plans in 2008 are discussed above. In 2007, the funded status of MMC’s Plans was significantly impacted by an increase in the
discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at December 31, 2007, reflecting a general widening of credit spreads on high quality corporate debt obligations and by contributions and asset returns.

Financing Cash Flows

Net cash used for financing activities was $540 million in
2008 compared with $2.6 billion of net cash used for financing activities in 2007. During 2008, MMC reduced outstanding debt by approximately $260 million. During 2007, MMC reduced outstanding debt by approximately $1.1 billion and repurchased $1.3
billion of its common stock. These actions are discussed more fully below.

Debt Repayment

During 2008, MMC’s 3.625% five-year fixed rate $250 million senior notes matured. MMC used cash on hand to manage liquidity, including the repayment of these notes.

During 2007, MMC utilized commercial paper and bank borrowings, as well as cash on hand, to manage liquidity, including the funding of maturing bonds and the repurchase of shares.
In the first quarter of 2007, MMC’s 5.375%, five-year $500 million senior notes matured. MMC’s three-year floating rate $500 million senior notes matured in the third quarter of 2007. MMC used a portion of its proceeds from the Putnam
transaction to pay down outstanding commercial paper and revolving credit facility borrowings. At December 31, 2008, no commercial paper or revolving credit facility borrowings were outstanding.

MMC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries maintain a $1.2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. Subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally
guaranteed by MMC. The facility will expire in December 2010. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2008.



MMC’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. MMC’s short-term
debt is currently rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-3 by Standard & Poor’s. MMC carries a stable outlook from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. In December 2007, Standard & Poor’s lowered its rating on
MMC’s long-term debt from BBB to BBB- and lowered the rating on MMC’s short-term debt from A-2 to A-3.

MMC also maintains other credit facilities,
guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $285 million at December 31, 2008 and $265 million at December 31, 2007. There were no outstanding
borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2008.

Share Repurchases

In August 2007, MMC entered into an $800 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty. Under the terms of the agreement, MMC paid the full $800 million purchase price and took delivery from the
counterparty of an initial tranche of 21,320,530 shares of MMC common stock, which were reflected as an increase in Treasury shares (a decrease in shares outstanding) on the delivery date. This number of shares was the quotient of the $800 million
purchase price divided by a contractual “cap” price of $37.5225 per share. Based on the market price of MMC’s common stock over the subsequent settlement period, in March 2008 the counterparty delivered to MMC an additional 10,751,000
shares for no additional payment and the transaction was concluded. MMC thus repurchased a total of 32,071,630 shares at an average price per share to MMC of $24.9442. The repurchased shares were reflected as an increase in Treasury shares (a
decrease in shares outstanding) on the respective delivery dates. This transaction was effected under a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization granted by MMC’s Board of Directors in August 2007. MMC remains authorized to repurchase
additional shares of its common stock up to a value of $700 million. There is no time limit on this authorization.

In May 2007, MMC entered into a $500 million
accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty. Under the terms of the agreement, MMC paid the full $500 million purchase price and took delivery from the counterparty of an initial tranche of 13,464,749 shares of
MMC common stock. Based on the market price of MMC’s common stock over the subsequent settlement period, in July 2007 the counterparty delivered to MMC an additional 2,555,519 shares for no additional payment and the transaction was concluded.
MMC thus repurchased a total of 16,020,268 shares in the transaction, for a total cost of $500 million and an average price per share to MMC of $31.2105. The repurchased shares were reflected as an increase in Treasury shares (a decrease in shares
outstanding) on the respective delivery dates. This transaction was effected under a $500 million share repurchase authorization granted by MMC’s Board of Directors in May 2007.

MMC did not repurchase any shares in 2008.

Dividends

MMC paid total dividends of $412 million in 2008 ($0.80 per share), $413 million ($0.76 per share) in 2007 and $374 million ($0.68 per share) in 2006.

Investing Cash Flows

Net cash used for investing activities amounted to $348 million in 2008. This compares with $3.0 billion of net cash
generated from investing activities in 2007, primarily due to the Putnam transaction. Cash used for acquisitions totaled $126 million in 2008 compared with $206 million in 2007. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $60 million related
to acquisitions completed in 2008 and prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2008. Cash provided by the sale of securities was $20 million
in 2008. In 2007, cash provided by the sale of securities of $78 million was partly offset by cash used to purchase investments of $44 million.

MMC’s additions
to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $386 million in 2008 and $378 million in 2007, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs.



MMC has committed to potential future investments of approximately $81 million in connection with its investments in Trident II and
other funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC. The majority of MMC’s investment commitments for funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC are related to Trident II, the investment period for which is now closed for new investments. Any
remaining capital calls for Trident II would relate to follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses. Significant future capital calls related to Trident II are not expected. Although it
is anticipated that Trident II will be harvesting its remaining portfolio, the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by MMC.

Commitments and Obligations

MMC’s contractual obligations of the types identified in the table below were of the following amounts
as of December 31, 2008:

The above does not include unrecognized tax benefits of $293 million, accounted for under FIN 48, as MMC is unable to
reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $20 million that may become payable during 2009. The above does not include liabilities established under FIN 45 as MMC is unable to reasonably predict the
timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $3 million that may become payable during 2009.

Market Risk and Credit Risk

Certain of MMC’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and
equity markets.

Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk

MMC has historically
managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance MMC’s asset base. During 2007, virtually all of MMC’s variable rate borrowings were repaid.

Interest income generated from MMC’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates, particularly short-term interest
rates.

MMC had the following investments subject to variable interest rates:

These investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in the above-indicated Notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates decrease by 10%, or 13 basis points over the course of the year, annual interest income,
including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would decrease by approximately $4 million.

In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund
investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk. To minimize this risk, MMC and its subsidiaries



invest pursuant to a Board approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with
counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment. MMC carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash
and fiduciary funds are invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.

Foreign Currency Risk

The translated values of revenue and expense from MMC’s international Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in
currency exchange rates. The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 54% of total revenue. Note 17 details revenue by geographic area. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit
foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business.

Equity Price Risk

MMC holds investments in public and private companies, as well as in certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point Capital.
Publicly traded investments of $21 million are classified as available for sale under SFAS No. 115. Non-publicly traded investments of $91 million are accounted for using the cost method and $207 million are accounted for using the equity
method under APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock”. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market
value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable
accounting pronouncements.

Other

A significant number of lawsuits and
regulatory proceedings are pending. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management
to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding
MMC’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may
differ from those estimates.

Legal and Other Loss Contingencies

MMC and
its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings. GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. Significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance. MMC analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters,
to assess its potential liability.

In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the
amount of recoveries that are expected under MMC’s various insurance programs.

Retirement Benefits

MMC maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible
non-U.S. employees. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.



In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 I” (“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires that MMC recognize the funded status of its overfunded
defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans (the “Plans”) as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been
recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in MMC’s consolidated balance sheets. MMC adopted the provisions of SFAS 158, prospectively, on
December 31, 2006.

The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets, the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. MMC
believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, MMC expects pension expense in 2009 to be
essentially the same as 2008.

Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions and various other
factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and
U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 85% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows:

Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense,
because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate.

MMC contributes to certain health care and life insurance
benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the United States is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by MMC as incurred. This
postretirement liability is included in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes

MMC’s tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates
and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. On January 1, 2007 MMC adopted the provisions of FIN 48, to
account for the uncertainty in income taxes. Accordingly, MMC reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with
FIN 48 is a two-step process, the first step involves recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only
the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts
and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that
meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position



is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.

Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in
judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring
an assessment for an issue. Prior to January 1, 2007, MMC estimated its uncertain income tax obligations in accordance with SFAS 109 and SFAS 5. MMC recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax
expense.

Tax law requires items be included in MMC’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the
annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are
temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has
been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or
credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. MMC evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent
years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. MMC also considers tax-planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income
in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the appropriate tax law. The underlying assumptions MMC uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account MMC’s recent performance. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets
when it is estimated that it is more likely than not future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.

Fair
Value Determinations

Investment Valuation—MMC holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain private equity funds. The majority
of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities under SFAS No. 115. Certain investments, primarily investments in private equity funds are accounted for using the equity method under APB Opinion No. 18.
Although not directly recorded in MMC’s consolidated balance sheets, MMC’s defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately $8 billion. The fair value of these investments determines in part, the over- or under-funded status
of those plans, which is included in MMC’s consolidated balance sheets. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. MMC
bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. Fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the Funds’ investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private
equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments;
trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for equity holdings
in private companies, or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of MMC’s investments. MMC reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation
results for significant private equity investments.



Goodwill Impairment Testing—Under SFAS 142, MMC is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for
impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. MMC performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. Fair values of the reporting units are
estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities, as well as an allocation of those
assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. As previously disclosed, MMC performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment in its Risk Consulting & Technology segment which resulted in impairment charges totaling $540
million recorded in the first and second quarters of 2008. MMC completed its 2008 annual review in the third quarter of 2008 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The fair value estimates used in this assessment are dependent upon
assumptions and estimates about the future profitability and other financial ratios of our reporting units, as well as relevant financial data, recent transactions and market valuations of comparable public companies. If in the future, the
performance of our reporting units varies significantly from our projections or our assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units change, the estimated fair value of our reporting units could change materially and could
result in an impairment of goodwill.

Share-based Payment

SFAS 123R
“Share-based Payment”, requires among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility
and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as
defined by SFAS 123R.

As of December 31, 2008, there was $16.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The weighted-average
periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.4 years. Also as of December 31, 2008, there was $288 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock
unit awards.

See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of SFAS 123R.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations:

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (“MMC”), a global professional services firm, is organized based on the different
services that it offers. Under this organizational structure, MMC’s three business segments are Risk and Insurance Services, Consulting and Risk Consulting & Technology. As noted below, on August 3, 2007 Great-West Lifeco Inc.
completed its purchase of Putnam, MMC’s former investment management segment.

As discussed in Note 5, MMC disposed of several businesses from 2006 through 2008,
which are classified as discontinued operations in these financial statements.

The Risk and Insurance Services segment provides risk management and insurance
broking, reinsurance broking and insurance program management services for businesses, public entities, insurance companies, associations, professional services organizations, and private clients. MMC conducts business in this segment primarily
through Marsh and Guy Carpenter.

The Consulting segment provides advice and services to the managements of organizations in the areas of human resource consulting,
comprising retirement and investments, health and benefits, outsourcing and talent; and strategy and risk management consulting, comprising management, economic and brand consulting. MMC conducts business in this segment through Mercer and Oliver
Wyman Group.

The Risk Consulting & Technology segment provides various risk consulting and related risk mitigation services to corporate, government,
institutional and individual clients. These services fall into two main business groups: Consulting, which includes corporate advisory and restructuring services, consulting services and security services; and technology-enabled services. MMC
conducts business in this segment through Kroll. In the fourth quarter of 2008, MMC disposed of its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses. As described in Note 5, MMC recorded a loss of $28 million on the disposition of the U.K. restructuring
businesses. The net assets of the U.K. businesses were written-off upon transfer to the new owners. MMC will receive royalties on future revenue of these businesses over the next four years. The royalties will be recognized when earned under the
terms of the contracts and when collectibility is reasonably assured. The transfer of the U.S. restructuring business was financed with a seller note. In accordance with the accounting guidance in Topic 5e, assets and liabilities related to the U.S.
restructuring business of approximately $33 million and $22 million, respectively, are included in MMC’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008. If MMC receives interest and principal payments as scheduled for the U.S. business,
it will recover the value of the net assets transferred to the new owners and recognize a gain on the disposal of $18 million.

On August 3, 2007, Great-West
Lifeco Inc. completed the purchase of Putnam Investments Trust for $3.9 billion in cash. The purchase included Putnam’s interest in the T.H. Lee private equity business. Items related to Putnam that impacted discontinued operations in 2008 are
described in Note 8 to these consolidated financial statements. The pre-tax gain on the transaction and Putnam’s results through August 2, 2007 are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income
in 2007 and Putnam’s comparative operating results are included in discontinued operations in 2006.

Principles of Consolidation:

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities:

In its capacity as an insurance broker or agent, MMC collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurance
underwriters. MMC also collects claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds.

Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by MMC in a fiduciary
capacity. Interest income on these fiduciary funds amounted to $149 million in 2008, $193 million in 2007, and $180 million in



2006. Since fiduciary assets are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities.

Fiduciary assets include approximately $900 million of fixed income securities classified as available for sale. Unrealized gains or losses from available for sale securities are
recorded in other comprehensive income until the securities are disposed of, or mature. Unrealized gains, net of tax, at December 31, 2008 on these securities were $17 million.

Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables were $8.6 billion and $9.2 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. MMC is not a principal to the contracts under which the right to receive premiums
or the right to receive reimbursement of insured losses arises. Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables are, therefore, not assets and liabilities of MMC and are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In certain instances, MMC advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. These advances are made from corporate
funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as receivables.

Revenue:

Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes
insurance commissions, fees for services rendered, interest income on certain fiduciary funds. Insurance commissions and fees for risk transfer services generally are recorded as of the effective date of the applicable policies or, in certain cases
(primarily in MMC’s reinsurance operations), as of the effective date or billing date, whichever is later. Commissions are net of policy cancellation reserves, which are estimated based on historic and current data on cancellations. Fees for
non-risk transfer services provided to clients are recognized over the period in which the services are provided, using a proportional performance model. Fees resulting from achievement of certain performance thresholds are recorded when such levels
are attained and such fees are not subject to forfeiture.

As part of the sale of MMC Capital’s private equity management business in 2005, MMC retained the
right to receive certain performance fees related to the Trident II and Trident III private equity partnerships. MMC has deferred the recognition of such performance fee revenue of $77 million at December 31, 2008. This revenue is based on the
investment performance over the life of each private equity fund, and future declines in fund performance from current levels may result in the forfeiture of such revenue. MMC recognizes performance fee revenue when such fees are no longer subject
to forfeiture, which for the $77 million noted above, may take a number of years to resolve.

Consulting revenue includes fees paid by clients for advice and services
and commissions from insurance companies for the placement of individual and group contracts. Fee revenue for engagements where remuneration is based on time plus out-of-pocket expenses is recognized based on the amount of time consulting
professionals expend on the engagement. For fixed fee engagements, revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model. Revenue from insurance commissions not subject to a fee arrangement is recorded over the effective period of the
applicable policies. Revenues for asset based fees are recognized on an accrual basis by applying the daily/monthly rate as contractually agreed with the client to the net asset value. On a limited number of engagements, performance fees may also be
earned for achieving certain pre-determined performance criteria. Such fees are recognized when the performance criteria have been achieved and agreed to by the client. Expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue are billed
to the client and included in revenue.

Risk Consulting & Technology compensation consists of fees paid by clients. Such fees are typically charged on an
hourly, project, or fixed fee basis, and sometimes on a per service or per unit basis. Revenue is recognized as the services are performed pursuant to the applicable contractual arrangements. Revenue related to time and materials arrangements is
recognized in the period in which the services are performed. Revenue from hourly or daily rate engagements is recognized as hours are expended at the agreed-upon billing amounts. Revenue related to fixed price arrangements is recognized based upon
a proportional performance model. Revenue provided from credit services is recognized when the information is delivered to the customer, either electronically or by other means. The impact of any revisions in estimated total revenue and direct
contract costs is recognized in the



period in which they become known. Expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue are billed to the client and included in revenue. Kroll records
either billed or unbilled accounts receivable based on case-by-case invoicing determinations. Revenue from sales of software is recognized when the product is shipped, with the exception of royalty-based products, for which revenue is recognized as
applicable royalty reports are received. Revenue from software sales is recorded net of estimated customer returns and allowances. Contingent fees are recognized as earned and upon satisfaction of all conditions to their payment.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of certificates of deposit and time deposits, with original maturities of three months or
less, and money market funds.

Fixed Assets:

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for
improvements are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
operations as incurred.

Depreciation of buildings, building improvements, furniture, and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of these assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods covered by the applicable leases or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is less. MMC periodically reviews long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable.

The components of fixed assets are as follows:

Investment Securities:

MMC holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain
private equity funds. Publicly traded investments are classified as available for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”), and carried at market
value. Non-publicly traded investments are carried at cost in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18 (“APB 18”). Changes in the fair value of available for sale securities are recorded in stockholders’ equity, net of applicable
taxes, until realized. Securities classified as available for sale under SFAS 115, or carried at cost under APB 18, are considered long-term investments and are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Certain investments,  primarily investments in private equity funds, are accounted for using the equity method under APB 18 using a consistently applied three-month lag
period. The underlying private equity funds follow investment company accounting, where securities within the fund are carried at fair value. MMC records its proportionate share of the change in fair value of the funds in earnings which amounted to
a loss of $11 million in 2008 and gains of $140 million and $153 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Securities recorded using the equity method are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Gains, net of incentive compensation, or losses recognized in earnings from the investment securities described above are included in investment income (loss) in the consolidated
statements of income. Costs related to management of MMC’s investments, including incentive compensation partially derived from investment income and (loss), are recorded in operating expenses.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:

Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least
annually for impairment. MMC performs an annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. Fair values



of the reporting units are estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the
prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. Other intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are
amortized over their estimated lives and reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature. MMC had no indefinite lived identified intangible assets at December 31, 2008
or 2007.

Capitalized Software Costs:

MMC capitalizes certain costs to develop, purchase or modify software for the internal use of MMC. These costs
are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from three to ten years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage
are capitalized. Costs related to updates and enhancements are only capitalized if they will result in additional functionality. Capitalized computer software costs of $214 million and $242 million, net of accumulated amortization of $433 million
and $450 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Legal and Other Loss
Contingencies:

MMC and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings. MMC records liabilities for contingencies including legal costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. To the extent such losses can be recovered under MMC’s insurance programs, estimated recoveries are recorded when losses for insured events are recognized. Significant
management judgment is required to estimate the amounts of such contingent liabilities and the related insurance recoveries. MMC analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling
the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. Contingent liabilities are not discounted.

Income Taxes:

MMC’s tax rate
reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. On January 1, 2007 MMC
adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), to account for the uncertainty in income taxes. Accordingly, MMC reports a liability for unrecognized tax
benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two-step process, the first step involves recognition. We determine whether it is more
likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both
statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not
recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of
benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.

Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead
to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. Prior to
January 1, 2007, MMC estimated its uncertain income tax obligations in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”), and SFAS 5. MMC recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Tax law requires items be included in MMC’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the
financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the
returns, and some differences are



temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally
represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated
that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for
which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements.

U.S. Federal income taxes are
provided on unremitted foreign earnings except those that are considered permanently reinvested, which at December 31, 2008 amounted to approximately $2.2 billion. However, if these earnings were not considered permanently reinvested, the
incremental tax liability which otherwise might be due upon distribution, net of foreign tax credits, would be approximately $110 million.

Derivative
Instruments:

All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative
and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income
and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Change in the fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

Concentrations of Credit Risk:

Financial instruments which potentially subject MMC to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, commissions and fees receivable and insurance recoverables. MMC maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places its investments in a large number of high quality financial
institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which MMC does business, as well as the dispersion across
many geographic areas.

Per Share Data:

Basic net income per share and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the
respective after tax income by the weighted average number of shares of MMC’s common stock outstanding, excluding unvested restricted stock. Diluted net income per share and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing
the respective after tax income by the weighted average common shares outstanding, which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares. Reconciliation of net income to net income for diluted earnings per share and
basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding is presented below. The reconciling items, related to the calculation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, are the same for
continuing operations.

There were 50.7 million, 58.8 million and 64.4 million stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively. The calculation above includes approximately 3 million common stock equivalents related to stock options for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. There were 7 million common stock equivalents in 2008 that
would have increased diluted weighted average



common shares outstanding, however, they have not been included in the calculation since the Company reported a net loss.

Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results may vary from those estimates.

Reclassifications and Corrections:

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to
conform with current year presentation, in particular with regard to reclassification of certain items between compensation and benefits and other operating expenses in the consolidated income statements amounting to $73 million and
$66 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

During 2008, MMC recorded corrections to (1) the 2007 tax provision related to the Putnam transaction in the
third quarter of 2008; and (2) foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to certain inter-company balances. The correction related to foreign currency transactions represents the net impact of gains arising in 2007 and prior years
and a loss arising in 2008, which resulted in a net charge of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Under relevant accounting guidance, an entity must consider the materiality of errors on both the “iron curtain” and
“rollover” methods. Because MMC recorded the adjustment, there is no unrecorded misstatement at December 31, 2008 under the iron curtain method. When considering this error using the rollover method, MMC’s loss from continuing
operations in 2008 would have been approximately $30 million higher if the gains related to prior years had been correctly recorded in those prior years. MMC determined that the impact of these corrections was immaterial to its current and prior
period financial statements when taken as a whole.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

Effective January 1, 2008, MMC adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 157 related to items that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements on a recurring basis. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the
quality of inputs used to measure fair value and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on MMC’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 10 for further discussion
of SFAS 157.

In February 2008, the FASB issued a final Staff Position “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (“FSP 157-2”) that delays
the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, except for items that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements on a recurring basis. MMC
adopted the provisions of FSP 157-2 by deferring application of SFAS 157 to the fair value measurement of its reporting units for goodwill impairment and testing purposes, until the first quarter ended March 31, 2009. MMC does not expect the
application of SFAS 157 to its non-financial assets to have a material impact on consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159,
“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits an entity to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on
items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adjustment to reflect the difference between fair value and the carrying amount would
be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. MMC did not elect to adopt the fair value option for any financial assets or liabilities as of January 1, 2008.

On October 10, 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position (“FSP”). No. FAS 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is
Not Active”. The FSP applies to financial assets within the scope of SFAS 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”) and clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active. The FSP also provides guidelines
regarding factors to consider when determining whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired, including, (1) the nature of the underlying investment (for example, whether the security is debt, equity



or a hybrid), (2) the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects of
the issuer; or (4) the intent and ability of the holder to retain its investment in the issuer for a sufficient time to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. The FSP was effective October 10, 2008. The SEC and FASB Staff
stated that because fair value measurements and the assessment of impairment will likely require significant use of judgment, issuers must be sure to provide investors with clear and transparent disclosures. The FSP did not have a material impact on
MMC’s financial condition or reported results.

Future Application of New Accounting Pronouncements:

On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”), and SFAS 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements” (“SFAS 160”).

SFAS 141R requires entities in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose all information needed by investors and other
users to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.
The impact of adopting SFAS 141R will depend on the nature and terms of future acquisitions. Remaining valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions (liabilities) related to prior business combinations are not material.

SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest and accordingly, requires all entities to report
the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent to be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parent’s equity. The amount
of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest should be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. Changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent
retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary should be accounted for as equity transactions. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The impact of adopting SFAS 160 will not have a material
impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets” (“The FSP”). This FSP amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 by requiring an entity to use
its own assumptions adjusted for the entity-specific factors in paragraph 11 of SFAS 142, even when there is likely to be substantial cost or material modifications. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption prohibited. MMC will apply the provisions prospectively to intangible assets acquired beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 on January 1, 2009, will not have
a material effect on MMC’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1 (“FSP 03-6-1”)
“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” FSP 03-6-1 applies to the calculation of earnings per share (“EPS”) under SFAS 128 “Earnings per Share” for
share-based payment awards with rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. FSP 03-6-1indicates that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are
participating securities and should be included in the computation of EPS using the two-step method. FSP 03-6-1 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those years, which for MMC will be
the first quarter of 2009. All prior-period EPS data presented will be adjusted retrospectively (including interim statements, summaries of earnings and selected financial data) in conformity with the provisions of FSP 03-6-1. At December 31,
2008, MMC had approximately 18 million unvested shares or units that would be considered participating securities under FSP 03-6-1, of which, approximately 6 million were



considered common stock equivalents in MMC’s diluted earnings per share calculation. The impact on MMC’s diluted net income per share for the years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007 that will be restated as required by FSP 03-6-1 beginning in the first quarter of 2009, is as follows:

On November 24, 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 08-7 “Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets”
(“Issue No. 08-7”) which provides that a defensive intangible asset should be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. It should be valued separately from other intangible assets because the defensive intangible asset is
separately identifiable. Issue 08-7 also requires defensive intangible assets to be assigned a useful life in accordance with paragraph 11 of Statement 142. Issue 08-7 will be effective for defensive intangible assets acquired on or after
December 15, 2008. The impact of adopting Issue No. 08-7 will depend upon the nature of MMC’s future acquisitions.

On November 24, 2008, the FASB
ratified EITF Issue No. 08-6 “Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations” (“Issue No. 08-06”) to address the impact of business combination accounting under FASB Statement 141R and Statement 160 on the
application of the equity method. Issue No. 08-6 requires entities to measure equity-method investments initially at cost and to recognize other-than-temporary impairment of equity-method investments in accordance with APB Opinion 18, “The
Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock” (“Opinion 18”). Equity-method investors should not separately test an investee’s underlying asset(s) for impairment but they should recognize their share of any
impairment charge recorded by an investee in accordance with Opinion 18.

Issue No.08-6 requires equity-method investors to account for a share issuance by an
investee as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment. Any gain or loss resulting from an investee’s share issuance should be recognized in earnings. Issue No. 08-6 should be applied prospectively and is effective
for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The impact of Issue No. 08-6 on MMC’s future results will depend on whether transactions within its scope occur in the future.

On December 30, 2008 the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 132R-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Post Retirement Benefit Plan Assets” (“The
FSP”), an amendment of SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits”. The FSP requires disclosures about fair value measurements of plan assets similar to those
required by Statement 157 as well as (a) how investment allocation decisions are made, (b) the major categories of plan assets, and (c) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. This FSP is effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2009. Comparative information for earlier periods is not required at initial adoption. MMC is evaluating the impact of adopting the provisions of this FSP.



2.    Supplemental Disclosures

The following schedule provides additional information concerning acquisitions, interest and income taxes paid:

The consolidated cash flow statements include the cash flow impact of discontinued operations in each cash flow category. The
cash flow impact of discontinued operations from the operating, financing and investing cash flow categories is as follows:

An analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:

In December 2006, MMC contributed its limited partnership interest in the Trident III private equity fund, valued at $182
million, to its pension plan in the United Kingdom.

3.    Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income

The components of other comprehensive (loss) income are as follows:



The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows:

4.    Acquisitions and Dispositions

During 2008, MMC completed 12 acquisitions, for total purchase consideration of $166 million and also paid $14 million of contingent purchase consideration related to prior acquisitions. The allocation of purchase consideration
and contingent purchase consideration paid resulted in acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, amounting to $125 million and $56 million. Estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to adjustment when purchase
accounting is finalized.

5.    Discontinued Operations

In 2008, discontinued operations includes three discontinued operations—Putnam, Mediservice and Kroll Crucible—which are discussed in more detail below.

With regard to Putnam, discontinued operations in 2008 includes (1) the impact of immaterial corrections and other adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2007 tax provision related to the transaction, (2) adjustments to the tax
provision to reflect differences between tax returns filed in 2008 and the initial estimated provisions, and (3) interest on liabilities for certain tax-related indemnities provided as part of the transaction. In the first quarter of 2008,
Marsh completed the sale of Mediservice, a claims administration operation in Brazil. The gain on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, Kroll completed the sale of Kroll Crucible
(“Crucible”), a division of its government services operation. The loss on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in 2008.

In
2007, discontinued operations includes the gain on the sale of Putnam as well as Putnam’s operating income through August 2, 2007, and, in 2006, includes the operating income from Putnam, Sedgwick Claims Management Services
(“SCMS”), Kroll Security International (“KSI”) and Price Forbes. Discontinued operations in 2006 also include the gain on disposal of SCMS and a charge to reduce the carrying value of Price Forbes’ assets to fair value.

As part of the disposal of Putnam, MMC provided indemnities to GWL with respect to certain Putnam-related litigation and regulatory matters described in Note 16, and
certain indemnities related to contingent tax liabilities (the “indemnified matters”). In accordance with the guidelines of FASB Interpretation No. 45 (“FIN 45”), MMC estimated the “fair value” of the indemnities
based on a (i) probability weighted assessment of possible outcomes; or (ii) in circumstances where the probability or amounts of potential outcomes could not be determined, an analysis of similar but not identical circumstances prepared
by an MMC-affiliated professional economic valuation firm. As required by FIN 45, the amounts recognized are the greater of the estimated fair value of the indemnity or the amount required to be recorded under SFAS No. 5 or FIN 48 (for
tax-related matters). The remaining liability related to these indemnities (the “FIN 45 liability”) was approximately $216 million at December 31, 2008. The FIN 45 liability considers the potential settlement amount as well as related
defense costs. The matters for which indemnities have been provided are inherently uncertain as to their eventual outcome. The process of estimating “fair value” as required by FIN 45 entails necessarily uncertain assumptions about such
future outcomes. Consequently, the ultimate resolution of the matters for which indemnities have been provided may well vary significantly from the liabilities calculated under FIN 45.

The indemnities described above do not have a stated expiration date. MMC is released from risk under the indemnity as the indemnified matters are settled or otherwise resolved. Since MMC is not released from risk under the
indemnities simply based on the passage of time, future costs of settlements and/or legal fees related to the indemnified matters will be charged against the FIN 45



liability, so long as they are consistent with the estimated exposure contemplated for such matters in establishing the FIN 45 liability. MMC assesses the status of
the indemnified matters each reporting period to determine whether to cease reduction of the FIN 45 liability, and/or whether additional accruals are appropriate under either SFAS 5 (for non-tax related matters) or FIN 48 (for tax related matters).
Any future charges or credits resulting from the settlement or resolution of the indemnified matters, or any adjustments to the liabilities related to such matters will be recorded in discontinued operations, in accordance with SFAS 144.

During 2006, MMC completed the sale of several businesses: SCMS in January 2006, Price Forbes in September 2006 and KSI in December 2006. The gain or loss on disposal of these
businesses, including any charges to reduce the carrying value to fair value less cost to sell, is included in discontinued operations in 2006.

Price Forbes and SCMS
were part of MMC’s Risk and Insurance Services segment, while KSI was part of MMC’s Risk Consulting & Technology segment. Putnam represented the entire investment management segment.

Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations are as follows:

6.    Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Under SFAS 142, MMC is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may
have occurred. MMC recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $540 million in the first and second quarters of 2008, resulting from an interim goodwill impairment test in its Risk Consulting & Technology segment. MMC performs the annual
impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on
balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. MMC completed its 2008 annual review in the third quarter of
2008 and concluded that goodwill is not impaired.

Other intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their estimated lives and
reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature.

Changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill are as follows:

(a)

Primarily foreign exchange and purchase accounting adjustments.



Goodwill allocable to each of MMC’s reportable segments is as follows: Risk and Insurance Services $3.7 billion; Consulting
$2.0 billion; and Risk Consulting & Technology $1.1 billion. Amortized intangible assets consist of the cost of client lists, client relationships and trade names acquired. The gross cost and accumulated amortization is as follows:

Aggregate amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $72 million, $66 million and $80
million, respectively, and the estimated future aggregate amortization expense is as follows:

7.    Income Taxes

Income before income taxes and minority interest shown below is based on the geographic location to which such income is attributable. Although income taxes related to such income may be assessed in more than one jurisdiction, the income
tax provision corresponds to the geographic location of the income.



The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classifications are as follows:

(a)

Net of valuation allowances of $54 million and $38 million, respectively.

A reconciliation from the U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate to MMC’s effective income tax rate is shown below.

Valuation allowances had a net increase of $16 million in 2008 and $23 million in 2007. During the respective years,
adjustments of the beginning of the year balances of valuation allowances increased income tax expense by $8 million in 2008 and $13 million in 2007. None of the cumulative valuation allowances relate to amounts which if realized would reduce
goodwill or increase contributed capital in the future. Approximately 80% of MMC’s net operating loss carryforwards expire over various periods from 2009 through 2028, and others are unlimited. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax
assets, MMC considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. MMC evaluates all significant available positive and negative
evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its



forecast of future taxable income, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The underlying assumptions MMC uses in forecasting future taxable income require
significant judgment and take into account MMC’s recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible. Based
on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, and available tax planning strategies, MMC believes it is more likely than not that it will realize
the benefits of the deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowances at December 31, 2008. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income
during the carryforward period are reduced.

On January 1, 2007, MMC adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. This interpretation requires that MMC recognize in its consolidated financial
statements the impact of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, MMC
recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $13 million, which is accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in FIN
48 primarily refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the guidelines of FIN 48. Including this increase, MMC
had approximately $272 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of 2007. Of this total, $218 million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in
any future periods. MMC classifies interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions in the financial statements as income taxes. The total gross amount of such accrued interest and penalties, before any applicable federal benefit, at
January 1, 2007 was $40 million.

Following is a reconciliation of MMC’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits for the year-to-date periods ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007:

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 and 2007, $204 million and $228 million respectively,
represent the amount that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in any future periods. The total gross amount of accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2008 and 2007, before any applicable federal benefit,
was $64 million and $43 million, respectively.

As discussed in Note 5, MMC has provided certain indemnities related to contingent tax liabilities as part of the
disposal of Putnam. The balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2008 in the chart above includes balances related to Putnam. Following the close of the Putnam transaction, the unrecognized tax benefits of $26 million related to
stand alone tax returns filed by Putnam (not as part of an MMC consolidated tax group) have been reclassified and are included as part of the fair value liability for contingent tax indemnities established in accordance with FIN 45. In addition, at
January 1, and December 31, 2007, and December 31, 2008, balances of $22 million, $80 million and $81 million, respectively, included in the chart above relate to Putnam issues included in consolidated MMC tax returns. Since MMC
remains primarily liable to the taxing authorities for resolution of uncertain tax positions related to consolidated returns, these balances will remain as part of MMC's



consolidated liability for uncertain tax positions. Any future charges or credits that are directly related to the disposal of Putnam and the indemnified contingent
tax issues, including interest accrued in accordance with FIN 48, will be recorded in discontinued operations as incurred.

MMC is routinely examined by the
jurisdictions in which it has significant operations. The Internal Revenue Service completed its examination of 2003 through 2005 during the fourth quarter of 2008 and has begun the examination of 2006 through 2008. New York State is examining years
2003 through 2005 for various subsidiaries. California is examining years 2003 through 2005 and years 2000 through 2002 are in various stages of appeal. Massachusetts is examining years 2000 through 2004 for various subsidiaries. Inland Revenue in
the United Kingdom is examining tax years 2002 through 2005 for various subsidiaries. Earlier years are closed in all of the foregoing jurisdictions. MMC regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting
from examinations. MMC has established appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions in relation to the potential assessments. MMC believes the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition
of MMC, although a resolution could have a material impact on MMC’s net income or cash flows and on its effective tax rate in a particular future period. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease
between zero and approximately $135 million within the next twelve months due to settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitation.

8.    Retirement Benefits

MMC maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its eligible U.S. employees
and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible non-U.S. employees. MMC’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding
requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign law.

Combined U.S. and non-U.S. Plans

The weighted average actuarial assumptions utilized for the U.S. and significant non-U.S. defined benefit plans as of the end of the year are as follows:

MMC uses Mercer actuaries to perform valuations of its pension plans.
The long-term rate of return assumption is selected for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets. MMC utilizes a model developed by the Mercer
actuaries to assist in the setting of this assumption. The model takes into account several factors, including: actual and target portfolio allocation; investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust; historical
portfolio performance; relevant forward-looking economic analysis; and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. All returns utilized and produced by the model are geometric averages. These measures are used to
determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio. MMC generally does not adjust the rate of return assumption from year to year if, at the measurement date, it is within the best
estimate range, defined as between the 25

th

and 75

th

percentile of the expected
long-term annual returns in accordance with the “American Academy of Actuaries Pension Practice Council Note May 2001 Selecting and Documenting Investment Return Assumptions” and consistent with Actuarial Standards of Practice No. 27.
The historical five- and ten-year average asset returns of each plan are also reviewed to ensure they are consistent and



reasonable compared with the best estimate range. The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the assumed long-term rate of return to the
market-related value of plan assets as defined by SFAS No. 87. This market-related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the
difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the
future market-related value of the assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded.

The target asset allocation for the U.S. plans is 65%
equities and 35% fixed income, and for the U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 79% of non-U.S. plan assets, is 58% equities and 42% fixed income. As of the measurement date, the actual allocation of assets for the U.S. plan was 58% to equities
and 42% to fixed income, and for the U.K. plans was 53% to equities and 47% to fixed income. The assets of MMC’s defined benefit plans are well-diversified and are managed in accordance with applicable laws and with the goal of maximizing the
plans’ real return within acceptable risk parameters. MMC uses threshold-based portfolio rebalancing to ensure the actual portfolio remains consistent with target asset allocation ranges.

The U.S. qualified plan holds 8 million shares of MMC common stock. The shares were contributed to the Plan by MMC in September 2005. Prior to this contribution, the U.S.
qualified plan held no MMC securities.

The discount rate selected for each U.S. plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely
match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are based on appropriate bond indices such as the Markit iBoxx £ Corporates AA 15+ index in the U.K. Projected compensation increases reflect current
expectations as to future levels of inflation.

The components of the net periodic benefit cost for combined U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and other
postretirement plans are as follows:



U.S. Plans

The following schedules
provide information concerning MMC’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans:



Estimated amounts that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income in the next fiscal year:

The weighted average actuarial assumptions utilized in determining the above amounts for the U.S. defined benefit and other
U.S. postretirement plans as of the end of the year are as follows:

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension
plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $3.4 billion, $3.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and $326 million, $312 million and $0, respectively, as of December 31, 2007.

The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets was $3.4 billion and
$2.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and $326 million and $0, respectively, as of December 31, 2007.



The components of the net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 became law. The net periodic
benefit cost shown above for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, includes the subsidy.

The assumed health care cost trend rate for Medicare eligibles was
approximately 10.5% in 2008, gradually declining to 5% in 2019, and the rate for non-Medicare eligibles was 9.5% in 2008, gradually declining to 5% in 2017. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a small effect on the amounts reported for the
U.S. health care plans because MMC caps its share of health care trend at 5%. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:



Non-U.S. Plans

The following schedules
provide information concerning MMC’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and non-U.S. postretirement benefit plans.



Estimated amounts that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income in the

next fiscal year:



The weighted average actuarial assumption utilized in determining the above amounts for the non-U.S. defined benefit and other
non-U.S. postretirement plans as of the end of the year are as follows:

The non-U.S. defined benefit plans do not have any direct or indirect ownership of MMC common stock.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan
assets were $443 million, $390 million and $270 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and $338 million, $291 million and $207 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2007.

The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for non-U.S. pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets was $3.0 billion and $2.7
billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and $430 million and $288 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2007.

The components of the net periodic
benefit cost for the non-U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans and the curtailment, settlement and termination expenses under SFAS 88 are as follows:

The assumed health care cost trend rate was approximately 7.3% in 2008, gradually declining to 5.2% in 2013. Assumed health
care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the non-U.S. health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:



Estimated Future Benefit Payments

MMC’s estimated future benefit payments for its pension and postretirement benefits (without reduction for Medicare subsidy receipts) at December 31, 2008 are as follows:

Contribution Plans

MMC maintains
certain defined contribution plans for its employees, including the Marsh & McLennan Companies 401(K) Savings & Investment Plan (“SIP”), that are qualified under U.S. tax laws. Under these plans, eligible employees may
contribute a percentage of their base salary, subject to certain limitations. For the SIP, MMC matches a fixed portion of the employees’ contributions and may also make additional discretionary contributions. The SIP contains an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan under U.S. tax law and plan assets of which approximately $321 million at December 31, 2008 and $365 million at December 31, 2007 were invested in MMC common stock. If a participant does not choose an investment direction
for his or her future MMC matching contributions, they are automatically invested in the Putnam Fixed Income Fund or a Barclays Global Investors Lifepath Portfolio that most closely matches the participant’s retirement year. The cost of these
defined contribution plans related to continuing operations was $53 million, $46 million, and $45 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

9.    Stock Benefit Plans

MMC maintains multiple share-based payment arrangements under which employees are awarded grants of
restricted stock, stock options and other forms of stock-based payment arrangements. Effective July 1, 2005, MMC adopted the recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS
123 (R)”), using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost includes compensation cost for all share-based payment arrangements granted prior to but not yet vested as of July 1, 2005, based
on the grant date fair value and expense attribution methodology determined in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and compensation cost for all share-based payment arrangements granted subsequent to June 30, 2005, based on the
grant-date fair value and expense attribution methodology determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 (R).

MMC Incentive and Stock Award Plans

In 2000, the Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. 2000 Employee Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the “2000 Employee Plan”) and the Marsh &
McLennan Companies, Inc. 2000 Senior Executive Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the “2000 Executive Plan”) were adopted. The types of awards permitted under these plans include stock options, restricted stock, stock bonus units, restricted
and deferred stock units payable in MMC common stock or cash, and other stock-based and performance-based awards. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) determines, at its discretion, which
affiliates may participate in the plans, which eligible employees will receive awards, the types of awards to be received, and the terms and conditions thereof. The right of an employee to receive an award may be subject to performance conditions as
specified by the Compensation Committee. The 2000 Plans contain provisions which, in the event of a change in control of MMC, may accelerate the vesting of the awards. Awards relating to not more than 80,000,000 shares of common stock may be made
over the life of the 2000 Employee Plan plus shares



remaining unused under pre-existing employee stock plans. Awards relating to not more than 8,000,000 shares of common stock may be made over the life of the 2000
Executive Plan plus shares remaining unused under pre-existing executive stock plans.

Stock Options:

Options granted under the 2000 Plans may be designated as
either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. The Compensation Committee determines the terms and conditions of the option, including the time or times at which an option may be exercised, the methods by which such exercise price
may be paid, and the form of such payment. Options are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of MMC’s common stock at the date of grant. These option awards generally vest 25% per annum and have a contractual
term of 10 years. On March 16, 2005, MMC began granting options that provide for a market-based triggering event before a vested option can be exercised. The terms and conditions of these stock option awards provide that (i) options will
vest at a rate of 25% a year beginning one year from the date of grant and (ii) each vested tranche will only become exercisable if the market price of MMC’s stock appreciates to a level of 15% above the exercise price of the option and
maintains that level for at least ten (10) consecutive trading days after the award has vested. MMC accounts for these awards under SFAS 123(R) as market-condition options. The effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant-date fair
value of such awards. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period and is not subsequently adjusted if the market condition is not met. For awards without a market-based triggering event, compensation cost is generally
recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period which is normally the vesting period.

The estimated fair value of options granted without a
market-based triggering event is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model. This model takes into account several factors and assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues
with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumption at the time of grant. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) is estimated using the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees’ expected exercise and
post-vesting employment termination behavior. MMC uses a blended volatility rate based on the following: (i) volatility derived from daily closing price observations for the 10-year period ended on the valuation date, (ii) implied
volatility derived from traded options for the period one week before and one week after the valuation date and (iii) average volatility for the 10-year periods ended on 15 anniversaries prior to the valuation date, using daily closing price
observations. The expected dividend yield is based on expected dividends for the expected term of the stock options.

The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option
pricing valuation model for options granted by MMC in 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

The estimated fair value of options granted with a market-based triggering event was calculated using a binomial valuation
model. The factors and assumptions used in this model are similar to those utilized in the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model except that the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve over the
contractual term of the option, and the expected life is calculated by the model.

The assumptions used in the binomial option pricing valuation model for options
granted during 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:



A summary of the status of MMC’s stock option awards as of December 31, 2008 and changes during the year then ended is
presented below:

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of MMC’s option awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006 was $6.63, $7.79, and $8.55, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $3 million, $8 million, and $31 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, there was $16.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s option awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is 1.4 years. Cash
received from the exercise of stock options for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $21 million, $53 million, and $52 million, respectively.

MMC’s policy is to issue treasury shares upon option exercises or share unit conversion. MMC intends to issue treasury shares as long as an adequate number of those shares are available.

Restricted shares of MMC’s common stock may be awarded under MMC’s incentive and stock award plans and are subject to restrictions on
transferability and other restrictions, if any, as the Compensation Committee may impose. The Compensation Committee may also determine when and under what circumstances the restrictions may lapse and whether the participant receives the rights of a
stockholder, including, without limitation, the right to vote and receive dividends. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, restricted stock that is still subject to restrictions is forfeited upon termination of employment. Shares
granted generally become unrestricted at the earlier of: (1) January 1 of the year following the vesting grant date anniversary or (2) the later of the recipient’s normal or actual retirement date. For shares granted prior to
2004, the grant date anniversary is ten years. For shares granted during 2004 and 2005, the grant date anniversary is 7 years and 5 years, respectively. However, certain restricted shares granted in 2005 vest on the third anniversary of the grant
date. There were no restricted shares granted in 2008 or 2007.

A summary of the status of MMC’s restricted stock awards as of December 31, 2008 and changes
during the period then ended is presented below:

MMC did not grant any restricted stock awards during the years ended December 31, 2008 or 2007. The total fair value of
MMC’s restricted stock distributed during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $5.1 million, $0.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively.



Restricted Stock Units:

Restricted stock units may be awarded under MMC’s Incentive and Stock Award plans. The
Compensation Committee determines the restrictions on such units, when the restrictions lapse, when the units vest and are paid, and upon what terms the units are forfeited. The cost of these awards is amortized over the vesting period, which is
generally three years. Beginning with awards granted in 2006, awards to senior executives and other employees may include three-year performance-based restricted stock units and three-year service-based restricted stock units. The payout of
performance-based restricted stock units (payable in shares of MMC common stock) may range from 0–200% of the number of units granted, based on the achievement of objective, pre-determined MMC or operating company performance measures over a
three-year performance period. MMC accounts for these awards as performance condition restricted stock units. The performance condition is not considered in the determination of grant date fair value of such awards. Compensation cost is recognized
over the performance period based on management’s estimate of the number of units expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares paid out at the end of the three-year performance period. Dividend equivalents are paid on
both performance-based and service-based restricted stock units prior to payout, based on the initial grant amount.

A summary of the status of MMC’s restricted
stock unit awards as of December 31, 2008 and changes during the period then ended is presented below:

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of MMC’s restricted stock units granted during the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $29.60 and $30.30, respectively. The total fair value of MMC’s restricted stock units distributed during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $22.4 million, $7.4 million and $5.8
million, respectively.

Deferred Stock Units:

Deferred stock units may be awarded under MMC’s incentive and stock award plans. The Compensation Committee
determines the restrictions on such units, when the restrictions lapse, when the units vest and are paid, and upon what terms the units are forfeited. The cost of these awards is amortized over the vesting period, which is generally three years.

A summary of the status of MMC’s deferred stock unit awards as of December 31, 2008 and changes during the period then ended is presented below:

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of MMC’s deferred stock units granted during the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $28.83 and $29.36, respectively. The total fair value of MMC’s deferred stock units distributed during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $71.6 million, $75.6 million, and $53.5
million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, there was $288 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMC’s restricted stock, restricted
stock units and deferred stock unit awards.



MMC Stock Purchase Plans

In May 1999,
MMC’s stockholders approved an employee stock purchase plan (the “1999 Plan”) to replace the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “1994 Plan”), which terminated on September 30, 1999 following its fifth annual
offering. Under the current terms of the plan, shares are purchased four times during the plan year at a price that is 95% of the average market price on each quarterly purchase date. Under the 1999 Plan, after including the available remaining
unused shares in the 1994 Plan and reducing the shares available by 10,000,000 consistent with the MMC Board of Directors’ action in March 2007, no more than 35,600,000 shares of MMC’s common stock may be sold. Employees purchased
1,361,787 shares during the year ended December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, 8,564,609 shares were available for issuance under the 1999 Plan. Under the 1995 MMC Stock Purchase Plan for International Employees (the “International
Plan”), after reflecting the additional 5,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance approved by the MMC Board of Directors in July 2002, and the addition of 4,000,000 shares due to shareholder action in May 2007, no more than 12,000,000
shares of MMC’s common stock may be sold. Employees purchased 260,717 shares during the year ended December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, 3,716,056 shares were available for issuance under the International Plan. The plans are
considered non-compensatory under SFAS 123(R).

10.    Fair Value Measurements

Effective January 1, 2008, MMC adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements.

Fair Value Hierarchy

MMC categorizes financial instruments into a three-level fair value
hierarchy as defined in SFAS 157. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs
used to measure fair value might fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

Financial assets recorded in the consolidated balance sheets are
categorized based on the inputs in the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1.

Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or
liabilities in an active market (examples include active exchange-traded equity securities, listed derivatives, most U.S. Government and agency securities, and certain other sovereign government obligations).

Assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include exchange traded equity securities and mutual funds.

Level 2.

Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following:

a) Quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities in active markets (for example, restricted stock);

b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active
markets (examples include corporate and municipal bonds, which trade infrequently);

c) Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability (examples include most over-the-counter derivatives, including interest rate and currency swaps); and

d)
Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full asset or liability (for example, certain mortgage loans).



Assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include corporate and municipal bonds.

Level 3.

Financial assets and liabilities, whose values are based on prices, or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to
the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability (examples include private equity investments, certain commercial
mortgage whole loans, and long-dated or complex derivatives including certain foreign exchange options and long-dated options on gas and power).

The Company does not
have any Level 3 assets or liabilities.

Valuation Techniques

Equity
Securities & Mutual Funds

Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the sale price on their principal exchange, or
official closing bid price for certain markets. If no sales are reported, the security is valued at its last reported bid price.

Other Sovereign Government
Obligations, Municipal Bonds and Corporate Bonds

.

These investments are valued on the basis of valuations furnished by an independent pricing service approved by
the Trustees or dealers selected by Putnam Investment Management LLC (“Putnam Management”), the fund’s manager, a wholly owned subsidiary of Putnam LLC. Such services or dealers determine valuations for normal institutional-size
trading units of such securities using methods based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships, generally recognized by institutions traders, between securities.

The following fair value hierarchy table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31,
2008.

Fair Value Measurement on a Recurring Basis

(a)

Included in Long-Term Investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(b)

Included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(c)

Included in Fiduciary Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

11.    Long-term Commitments

MMC leases office facilities, equipment and automobiles under noncancelable operating leases. These
leases expire on varying dates; in some instances contain renewal and expansion options; do not restrict the payment of dividends or the incurrence of debt or additional lease obligations; and contain no significant purchase options. In addition to
the base rental costs, occupancy lease agreements generally provide for rent escalations resulting from increased assessments for real estate taxes and other charges. Approximately 98% of MMC’s lease obligations are for the use of office space.



The consolidated statements of income include net rental costs of $468 million, $511 million and $509 million for 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively, after deducting rentals from subleases ($8 million in 2008, $23 million in 2007 and $26 million in 2006). The net rental costs disclosed above exclude rental costs and sublease income for previously accrued restructuring charges
related to vacated space.

At December 31, 2008, the aggregate future minimum rental commitments under all noncancelable operating lease agreements are as
follows:

MMC has entered into agreements with various service companies to outsource certain information systems activities and
responsibilities and processing activities. Under these agreements, MMC is required to pay minimum annual service charges. Additional fees may be payable depending upon the volume of transactions processed, with all future payments subject to
increases for inflation. At December 31, 2008, the aggregate fixed future minimum commitments under these agreements are as follows:

12.    Debt

MMC’s outstanding debt is as follows:



During the first quarter of 2008, MMC’s 3.625% five-year fixed rate $250 million senior notes matured. MMC used cash on hand
to fund the maturing notes. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008 or 2007.

MMC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries
maintain a $1.2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. Subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by MMC. The facility expires in December 2010. The interest rate on this facility varies based upon the level
of usage of the facility and MMC’s credit ratings. The facility requires MMC to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2008 or
2007.

Additional credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit are maintained with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United
States, aggregating $285 million at December 31, 2008 and $265 million at December 31, 2007. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2008 or December 31, 2007.

Scheduled repayments of long-term debt in 2009 and in the four succeeding years are $408 million, $559 million, $8 million, $259 million and $259 million, respectively.

13.    Financial Instruments

The estimated fair value of
MMC’s significant financial instruments is provided below. Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that MMC would realize
upon disposition, nor do they indicate MMC’s intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

: The estimated fair value of MMC’s cash and cash equivalents approximates their
carrying value.

Long-term Investments

: Long-term investments include available for sale securities recorded at quoted market prices as discussed below. MMC
also has certain additional long-term investments, for which there are no readily available market prices, amounting to $91 million and $43 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which are carried on a cost basis. MMC monitors
these investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary.

MMC had available for sale securities with an aggregate fair
value of $21 million and $23 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which are carried at market value under SFAS 115. The Company recorded gross unrealized gains of $24 million and gross unrealized losses of $8 million at
December 31, 2008 compared with gross unrealized gains of $22 million recorded at December 31, 2007. These amounts have been excluded from earnings and reported, net of deferred income taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which
is a component of stockholders’ equity.

The 2008 unrealized gain of $24 million relates to the portion of insurance fiduciary funds which MMC holds to satisfy
fiduciary obligations that are invested in high quality debt securities which are generally held to maturity.

MMC recorded net gains/(losses) associated with its
available for sale securities of $(3) million, $20 million and $35 million, in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $19 million, $29
million and $52 million, respectively. Gross realized gains/(losses) on available for sale securities sold during 2008, 2007 and 2006 amounted to $(3) million, $20 million and $35 million, respectively. The cost of



securities sold is determined using the average cost method for equity securities. The gains and losses described above are included in investment income (loss) in the
consolidated statements of income.

MMC also holds investments in certain private equity fund partnerships which are accounted for using the equity method and other
investments that are held at cost. MMC recorded gains (losses) from such investments of $(9) million, $148 million and $166 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The loss in 2008 included a $6.3 million loss related to the decline in value
of securities that were carried at cost. These losses were other than temporary. During 2007 and 2006, MMC did not record any losses related to the decline in value of its equity method investments or investments carried at cost that were other than
temporary. The gains and losses described above are included in investment income (loss) in the consolidated statements of income.

In 2007, MMC’s investment in
Trident II, L.P. met the thresholds which require disclosure of summarized financial information under Regulation S-X. The consolidated information presented below reflects the most recently available financial statements at September 30, 2008 and
December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Short-term and Long-term Debt

: The fair value of MMC’s short-term debt, which consists primarily of term debt
maturing within the next year, approximates its carrying value. The estimated fair value of MMC’s long-term debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities.

14.    Integration and Restructuring Costs

Actions Initiated in 2008

In 2008, MMC implemented restructuring actions resulting in charges totaling $262 million, primarily related to
severance and benefits, and other related charges totaling $50 million related to the loss of $28 million on the sale of the U.K. restructuring businesses and accelerated amortization. These costs were incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance
Services—$218 million, Consulting—$40 million, Risk Consulting & Technology—$45 million, and Corporate—$9 million. These activities resulted in the elimination of approximately 1,660 positions at Marsh, 360 positions at
Guy Carpenter, 490 positions at Mercer, 300 positions at Risk Consulting & Technology and 85 positions at Corporate. In addition, Marsh outsourced approximately 700 positions as part of its U.K. back office outsourcing initiative. As of December
31, 2008, the remaining liability for the restructuring initiatives were approximately $97 million primarily related to severance and benefit payments and future lease obligations.



Actions Initiated Prior to 2008

In 2008, MMC recorded $73 million of restructuring charges and other related charges of $3 million, including a charge of $62 million for future rent and real estate costs to exit five floors in MMC’s New York headquarters building
that was part of the restructuring plan announced in 2006, and $11 million of charges related to the estimated costs of future rent associated with previously vacated properties in the U.K. and other locations. These amounts were included in
corporate expenses. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining liability for the restructuring initiatives were approximately $126 million primarily related to future severance and benefit payments and estimated future lease obligations.

The expenses associated with the restructuring plans are included in compensation and benefits and other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income,
and liabilities associated with these initiatives are classified on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable, other liabilities, or accrued salaries, depending on the nature of the items.

15.    Common Stock

In August 2007, MMC entered into an $800 million
accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty. Under the terms of the agreement, MMC paid the full $800 million purchase price and took delivery from the counterparty of an initial tranche of 21,320,530 shares of
MMC common stock. This number of shares was the quotient of the $800 million purchase price divided by a contractual “cap” price of $37.5225 per share. Based on the market price of MMC’s common stock over the subsequent settlement
period, in March 2008 the counterparty delivered to MMC an additional 10,751,100 shares for no additional payment and the transaction was concluded. MMC thus repurchased a total of 32,071,630 shares at average price per share to MMC of $24.9442. The
repurchased shares were reflected as an increase to treasury shares (a decrease in shares outstanding) on the respective delivery dates. This transaction was effected under a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization granted by MMC’s Board of
Directors in August 2007. MMC remains authorized to repurchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of $700 million. There is no time limit on this authorization.

In May 2007, MMC entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty. Under the terms of the agreement, MMC paid the full $500 million purchase price and took delivery
from the counterparty of an initial tranche of 13,464,749 shares of MMC common stock. Based on the market price of MMC’s common stock over the subsequent settlement period, in July 2007 the counterparty delivered to MMC an additional 2,555,519
shares for no additional payment and the transaction was concluded. MMC thus repurchased a total of 16,020,268 shares in the transaction, for a total cost of $500 million and an average price per share to MMC of $31.2105. The repurchased shares were
reflected as an increase in treasury shares (a decrease in shares outstanding) on the respective delivery dates. This transaction was effected under a $500 million share repurchase authorization granted by MMC’s Board of Directors in May 2007.

16.    Claims, Lawsuits and Other Contingencies

MMC and Marsh Litigation and Regulatory Matters

Brokerage Compensation Practices Settlement

In January 2005, MMC and its subsidiary Marsh Inc. entered into an agreement with the New York State Attorney General (“NYAG”) and the New York State Insurance Department
to settle a civil complaint filed in New York State court by NYAG in October 2004 (the “NYAG Lawsuit”) and a related citation issued by the Insurance Department. Among other things, the NYAG Lawsuit and the citation had alleged that
Marsh’s use of market service agreements with various insurance companies entailed fraudulent business practices, bid-rigging, illegal restraint of trade and other statutory violations.



Following the filing of the NYAG Lawsuit, various state regulators and attorneys general initiated investigations relating to the
conduct alleged in the NYAG Lawsuit. Civil actions were filed against MMC, Marsh and certain Marsh subsidiaries by the State of Connecticut in January 2005, the State of Florida in March 2005 and the State of Ohio in August 2007. The complaints in
these actions sought a variety of monetary damages and injunctive and other equitable relief and were based on a variety of legal theories, including unfair trade practices, antitrust, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty and state
RICO laws. In the fourth quarter of 2008, MMC entered into a settlement with attorneys general in the states of Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Michigan, Oregon, Texas and West Virginia; the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania; and the
Florida Department of Financial Services and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. As part of that settlement, the civil lawsuit brought by the State of Florida has been dismissed. The actions by the State of Connecticut and the State of Ohio,
which assert claims based on unfair trade practices and antitrust, remain pending.

Numerous private party lawsuits have been commenced against MMC, one or more of
its subsidiaries, and their current and former directors and officers, relating to matters alleged in the NYAG Lawsuit. These lawsuits include the following:

Policyholder Claims

¡

Various putative class actions purportedly brought on behalf of policyholders were consolidated into two actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey
(one on behalf of a purported class of "commercial" policyholders and the second on behalf of a purported class of "employee benefit" policyholders). The actions alleged a variety of legal theories, including those related to state tort, contract,
fiduciary duty, federal and state antitrust and RICO theories, and sought a variety of remedies, including unspecified monetary damages, treble damages, disgorgement, restitution, punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys'
fees and costs. The court dismissed all of the federal antitrust and RICO claims and all of the state law claims asserted in both actions, and the plaintiffs appealed. In June 2008, plaintiffs and the Marsh defendants entered into an agreement to
settle the commercial and employee benefit policyholder putative class actions using the remainder available from the $850 million fund created in connection with the settlement of the NYAG Lawsuit. The court approved the settlement on
February 18, 2009.

¡

In July 2007, two putative class actions against MMC, Marsh, certain insurers and other insurance brokers purportedly brought on behalf of policyholders were filed in the
U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of Florida and the Southern District of New York. These actions relate to the same practices alleged in the NYAG Lawsuit, but with respect to insurance coverage placed with Certain Underwriters at
Lloyd’s, London. These actions have been transferred to the District of New Jersey.

¡

Four class or representative actions on behalf of policyholders are pending in state courts. Nineteen actions instituted by individual policyholders and others are pending in
federal and state courts relating to matters alleged in the NYAG Lawsuit. Two putative class actions and an individual policyholder action are pending in Canada.

Shareholder Claims

Following the announcement of the NYAG Lawsuit and related actions taken by MMC, MMC’s stock price dropped from
approximately $45 per share to a low of approximately $22.75 per share. The number of shares outstanding at the time was approximately 526 million. The plaintiffs in the securities claims described below have asserted damages in the billions of
dollars.

¡

A purported securities class action against MMC, Marsh and certain of their former officers is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Plaintiffs make factual allegations similar to those asserted in the NYAG Lawsuit, including that MMC artificially inflated its share price by making misrepresentations and omissions relating to Marsh’s



market service agreements and business practices. Plaintiffs also allege that MMC failed to disclose alleged anti-competitive and illegal practices at Marsh, such as
“bid-rigging” and soliciting fictitious quotes. Plaintiffs allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and seek unspecified damages. MMC has
responded to the complaint and discovery in this matter is ongoing.

¡

Three individual shareholder actions against MMC and others were pending in state courts. All three of the actions have been dismissed; the plaintiffs in each action either
have appealed or may appeal.

¡

A purported ERISA class action is pending against MMC and various current and former employees, officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of an MMC retirement plan. The complaint alleges, among other things, that in light of the alleged misconduct described in the NYAG Lawsuit, the defendants knew or should have known that the
investment of the plan’s assets in MMC stock was imprudent, that certain defendants failed to provide plan participants with complete and accurate information about MMC stock, that certain defendants responsible for selecting, removing and
monitoring other fiduciaries did not comply with ERISA, and that MMC knowingly participated in other defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duties. The complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages, injunctive relief and
attorneys’ fees and costs. Discovery is underway in this matter.

¡

Several shareholder derivative actions are pending against MMC’s current and former directors and officers. Most of these actions have been consolidated into two
proceedings, one in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and one in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. These actions allege, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties with respect to the alleged misconduct
described in the NYAG Lawsuit, and that the defendants are liable for and must contribute to or indemnify MMC for any related damages MMC has suffered. The consolidated action in federal court in New York has been stayed in favor of the state
derivative action in Delaware, which remains in its preliminary stages.

Other Claims

¡

A shareholder derivative suit pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the directors and officers of American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”) names as
additional defendants MMC, Marsh, certain Marsh subsidiaries and certain former officers and employees. The suit alleges that the MMC and Marsh defendants engaged in conspiracy and fraud with respect to the alleged misconduct described in the NYAG
Lawsuit, and that the MMC and Marsh corporate defendants aided and abetted current and former directors and officers of AIG in breaching their fiduciary duties to AIG with respect to AIG’s participation in the alleged misconduct. The complaint
seeks damages including the return of all contingent commissions paid by AIG to MMC and Marsh. The MMC and Marsh corporate defendants have moved to dismiss the claims.

Other Governmental Inquiries and Claims Relating to MMC and its Subsidiaries

¡

In December 2007, the Alaska Retirement Management Board filed a civil lawsuit against Mercer (US) Inc. in Alaska state court for alleged professional negligence in actuarial
services that Mercer provided to the Alaska Division of Retirement and Benefits relating to the Alaska Public Employees Retirement System and the Alaska Teachers Retirement System. The complaint alleges damages of “at least $1.8 billion.”
Discovery is underway in this matter.

¡

In October 2007, the State of Connecticut brought a civil action against Guy Carpenter in Connecticut state court, alleging that Guy Carpenter violated the state’s
antitrust and unfair trade practices laws by engaging in allocation of markets, price-fixing and other allegedly improper conduct by taking part in the operation of several reinsurance facilities over a period



of decades. The complaint alleges damages to Guy Carpenter’s insurance company clients and their customers, as well as to the general economy of Connecticut, and
seeks monetary damages, civil penalties, attorneys’ fees, costs and injunctive and other equitable relief. Discovery is underway in this matter.

¡

In March 2006, Milwaukee County and the Employees Retirement System of the County of Milwaukee and its Pension Board filed a civil lawsuit against Mercer (US) Inc. in the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin alleging professional negligence in the provision of actuarial services and seeking damages in excess of $300 million. The court has denied a summary judgment motion by Mercer seeking
dismissal of the plaintiffs' claims. The case is scheduled for trial beginning in May 2009.

¡

Our activities are regulated extensively under the laws of the United States and its various states, the European Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in
which we operate. Therefore, in the ordinary course of business, in addition to private party lawsuits, we may be subject to investigations, lawsuits and/or other regulatory actions undertaken by governmental authorities.

Putnam-Related Matters

On August 3, 2007,
Great-West Lifeco Inc. (“GWL”) completed its purchase of Putnam Investments Trust. Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement with GWL, a copy of which was included as an exhibit to MMC’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on
February 1, 2007, MMC agreed to indemnify GWL in the future with respect to certain Putnam-related litigation and regulatory matters. The matters described below directly involve MMC and/or may be subject to these indemnification obligations:

“Market-timing” Related Matters

In 2003 and 2004, Putnam
entered into settlements with the SEC and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with respect to excessive short-term trading by, among others, certain former Putnam employees in shares of the Putnam mutual funds (the “Putnam Funds”).

¡

MMC and Putnam were named in a substantial number of civil complaints, filed in various state and federal courts, alleging "market-timing" and, in some cases, “late
trading” activities. The actions filed in or removed to federal court have been transferred, along with actions against other mutual fund complexes, to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The following summarizes the
consolidated matters pending in the District of Maryland:

¡

Two putative class actions by investors in certain Putnam Funds are pending against Putnam. One action asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The other action purports to assert derivative claims on behalf of all Putnam Funds under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act. Both suits seek to
recover unspecified damages allegedly suffered by the Putnam Funds and their investors as a result of purported market-timing and late trading activity in certain Putnam Funds. On December 30, 2008, the court granted in part Putnam’s
motion for summary judgment in the non-derivative action, and denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification pending resolution of all summary judgment issues. In the derivative action, the court denied Putnam’s motion for summary
judgment.

¡

A complaint asserting shareholder derivative claims, purportedly on behalf of MMC, was filed against current and former members of MMC’s Board of Directors, two of
Putnam’s former officers, and MMC as a nominal defendant. This action alleges violation of fiduciary duties in failing to provide oversight regarding market-timing in the Putnam Funds. This action has been stayed pursuant to an agreement of the
parties.



¡

MMC, Putnam, and certain of their current and former officers, directors and employees are defendants in purported ERISA class actions, one brought by participants in an MMC
retirement plan and the other brought by participants in a Putnam retirement plan. The actions allege, among other things, that, in view of the market-timing that was allegedly allowed to occur at Putnam, the investment of the plans' funds in MMC
stock and the Putnam Funds was imprudent and constituted a breach of fiduciary duties to plan participants. Both actions seek unspecified damages and equitable relief. Following a September 2006 dismissal of the action regarding the Putnam plan, the
plaintiff appealed the decision to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In June 2008, the appellate court reversed the dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings.

¡

Certain Putnam entities were named as defendants in a suit brought in the District Court of Travis County, Texas by a former institutional client, the Employee Retirement
System of Texas. Plaintiff alleged that Putnam breached its investment management advisory agreement and did not make appropriate disclosures regarding alleged market-timing activity at the time the investment management advisory agreement was
executed. The majority of plaintiff's claims were dismissed or withdrawn in January 2008. The trial court dismissed plaintiff’s remaining claim for breach of contract in June 2008. Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissals and Putnam has appealed
an adverse ruling on its counterclaim for unpaid management fees.

Other Contingencies Relating to MMC and its Subsidiaries

Errors and Omissions Claims

¡

MMC and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of other claims, lawsuits and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such claims and lawsuits consist
principally of alleged errors and omissions in connection with the performance of professional services. Certain of these claims, including the actions filed against Mercer by the State of Alaska and the County of Milwaukee, seek damages, including
punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant. MMC has varying levels of third-party insurance coverage, depending on the policy year. To the extent that expected losses exceed MMC’s retention in any policy year, MMC
records an asset for the amount that MMC expects to recover under any available third-party insurance programs. The policy limits and coverage terms of the third-party insurance vary to some extent by policy year, but MMC is not aware of coverage
defenses or other obstacles to coverage that would limit recoveries in years prior to policy year 2001-2002 in a material amount. In policy years subsequent to 2001-2002, the availability of third-party insurance has declined significantly, such
that the Company has, for example, limited third-party insurance for the claims asserted by the State of Alaska and the County of Milwaukee. MMC utilizes internal actuarial and other estimates, and case level reviews by inside and outside counsel,
to establish loss reserves, in accordance with SFAS No. 5 (“Accounting for Contingencies”), to provide for its loss retention. These reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant.

Guarantees

¡

In connection with its acquisition of U.K.-based Sedgwick Group in 1998, MMC acquired several insurance underwriting businesses that were already in run-off, including River
Thames Insurance Company Limited (“River Thames”), which MMC sold in 2001. Sedgwick guaranteed payment of claims on certain policies underwritten through the Institute of London Underwriters (the “ILU”) by River Thames. The
policies covered by this guarantee are reinsured up to £40 million by a related party of River Thames. Payment of claims under the reinsurance agreement is collateralized by segregated assets held in a trust. As of December 31, 2008,
the reinsurance coverage exceeded the best estimate of the projected liability of the policies covered by the guarantee. To the extent River Thames or the reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations under those policies, a claimant may seek to
recover from MMC under the guarantee.



¡

From 1980 to 1983, MMC owned indirectly the English & American Insurance Company (“E&A”), which was a member of the ILU. The ILU required MMC to
guarantee a portion of E&A’s obligations. After E&A became insolvent in 1993, the ILU agreed to discharge the guarantee in exchange for MMC’s agreement to post an evergreen letter of credit that is available to pay claims by
policyholders on certain E&A policies issued through the ILU and incepting between July 3, 1980 and October 6, 1983. In April 2006, a lawsuit was commenced in the Commercial Court in London against MMC and the ILU by an assignee of an
E&A policyholder that purported to have a claim against the MMC letter of credit in the amount of approximately $8.5 million and sought a judicial declaration of its rights as an assignee of a policyholder claim. MMC contested the claim and the
lawsuit was discontinued by the plaintiff in May 2007. MMC expects the plaintiff or others to continue to pursue this claim against the MMC letter of credit. MMC anticipates that additional claimants may seek to recover against the letter of credit.

The proceedings and other matters described in this Note 16 on Claims, Lawsuits and Other Contingencies may expose MMC to liability for significant
monetary damages and other forms of relief. Where a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, MMC has established reserves in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”. Except as specifically set forth above,
MMC's management is unable, at the present time, to provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to the foregoing matters or the impact they may have on MMC's consolidated results of operations or financial position (over
and above MMC’s existing loss reserves) or MMC’s cash flows (to the extent not covered by insurance). This is primarily because many of these cases remain in their early stages and only limited discovery has taken place. Adverse
determinations in one or more of the matters discussed above could have a material impact on MMC's financial condition, results of MMC’s operations or cash flows in a future period.

17.    Segment Information

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and of cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Marsh &
McLennan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for MMC. MMC’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

MMC’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures relating to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of MMC; the recording of all necessary
transactions to permit the preparation of MMC’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; the proper authorization of receipts and expenditures in accordance with authorizations of MMC’s
management and directors; and the prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on MMC’s consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management evaluated the effectiveness of MMC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company’s principal executives and financial officers. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework. Based on its evaluation, management determined that MMC maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that audited and reported on MMC’s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, also issued an attestation report on
the effectiveness of MMC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

New York, New York

We have
audited the internal control over financial reporting of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s board of
directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 of the Company and our report
dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
