Consumer Operations—Affinity/Program & Private Client

In addition to its main risk management and broking practices described above, Marsh operates a “Consumer” business in each geographic region that focuses on either or both of program marketing



and administration opportunities and high net worth individual insurance sales. The Affinity/Program businesses sell and administer insurance products and services on a program basis, typically
working with a sponsoring organization client to leverage the affinity relationship that client has with its constituencies (e.g., employees, members, franchisees, or customers, as the case may be). These programs typically include group
life & health coverage, professional liability coverage, personal property and liability coverage including automobile and homeowners’ insurance, business owner protection, annuities, and variable security-related products. Marsh
Consumer’s sales and servicing activities regarding high net worth individuals are largely U.S.-focused and operate under the names “Private Client Services” (for property & casualty insurance products), and “Private

REGULATION

The Company’s activities are subject to
licensing requirements and extensive regulation under United States federal and state laws, as well as laws of other countries in which the Company’s subsidiaries operate. See Part I, Item 1A (“Risk Factors”) below for a
discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses.

Risk and Insurance Services

.  While laws and regulations vary from location to location, every state of the United States and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market
intermediaries and related service providers (such as insurance brokers, agents and consultants, reinsurance brokers, managing general agents and third party administrators) to hold an individual and/or company license from a governmental agency or
self-regulatory organization. Some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locally-owned business entities; in this case, if the Company has no licensed subsidiary, we may maintain arrangements with residents or business
entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction. Such arrangements are only permitted following an extensive review process.



Beginning in January 2005, all European Union member states were required to implement the Insurance Mediation
Directive. This Directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance and reinsurance intermediaries, including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence, financial capacity and
professional indemnity insurance. The adoption by member states of the European Union of regulations to comply with the Directive has led our insurance intermediary operations in the European Union to become subject to enhanced regulatory
requirements. In January 2005, as part of the implementation of the Directive in the United Kingdom, the power and responsibilities of the Financial Services Authority, or FSA, were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance
intermediaries in the United Kingdom.

Insurance authorities in the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which the Company’s
subsidiaries do business, including the FSA in the United Kingdom, also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations
typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them.

Certain of the Company’s
Risk and Insurance Services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment, securities and futures licensing authorities. In the United States, Marsh and Guy Carpenter use the services of MMC Securities Corp., a broker-dealer
and investment adviser, registered in the U.S. with the SEC, and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency (FINRA) and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), primarily in connection with investment banking-related services
relating to insurance-linked and alternative risk financing transactions. Also in the United States, Marsh uses the services of NIA Securities, LLC, a U.S. registered broker-dealer and investment adviser. Guy Carpenter provides advice on securities
or investments in the European Union through MMC Securities (Europe) Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the FSA. Marsh also receives investment management services in the European Union from Marsh Investment Service Limited, which is also
regulated by the FSA. MMC Securities Corp., MMC Securities (Europe) Limited, NIA Securities, LLC, and Marsh Investment Service Limited are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Marsh & McLennan Companies.

In some jurisdictions, insurance-related taxes may be due either directly from clients or from the insurance broker. In the latter case, the broker customarily
looks to the client for payment.

Consulting

.

Certain of Mercer’s retirement-related consulting services are subject
to pension law and financial regulation in many countries, including by the SEC in the United States and the FSA in the United Kingdom. In addition, the trustee services, investment services (including advice to persons, institutions and other
entities on the investment of pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities) and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are
subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions. The benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory
oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our Risk and Insurance Services businesses. Mercer uses the services of MMC Securities Corp. with the provision of certain retirement and employee benefit services. Oliver
Wyman Group use the services of MMC Securities Corp. (in the United States) and MMC Securities (Europe) Limited (in the European Union), primarily in connection with corporate finance advisory services.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

The Company faces strong competition
in all of its businesses from providers of similar products and services, including competition with regard to identifying and pursuing acquisition candidates. The Company also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public
corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees. In addition to the discussion below, see “Risks Relating to the Company Generally –Competitive Risks,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

Risk and Insurance Services

.  The Company’s combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope. The principal
bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance



businesses compete include the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. The Company encounters strong competition from other insurance and reinsurance
brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market, distribute and service
their insurance and reinsurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants, that provide risk-related services and products.

Certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance (including captive insurance companies) as a supplement or
alternative to third-party insurance, thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements. Certain insureds also obtain coverage directly from insurance providers. There are also many other providers of affinity group and private
client services, including specialized firms, insurance companies and other institutions.

The continuing impact of legal and regulatory proceedings
concerning our insurance brokerage operations also could affect Marsh’s competitive position. These proceedings are discussed in more detail in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Please also read our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact under Part I, Item 1A (“Risk Factors”) below.

Consulting

.  The Company’s consulting and HR outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies, as well as regional
and local firms. These businesses compete generally on the basis of the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. Competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms, as well as consulting and outsourcing
operations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms.

Mercer’s investment consulting and investment
management businesses face competition from many sources, including multi-manager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions.

In many cases, clients have the option of handling the services provided by Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group internally, without assistance from outside advisors.

Item 1A.      Risk Factors

You should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report. These risks have the potential to materially
adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY GENERALLY

Legal and Regulatory Issues

We are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “errors and omissions” claims.

Our operating companies provide numerous professional services, including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting, actuarial and other services
for corporate and public clients around the world. As a result of these activities, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions, or “E&O,” claims, particularly in our Marsh and Mercer
businesses. In our Risk and Insurance Services segment, such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to adequately place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients. In our Consulting segment, such
claims include allegations of damages arising from our consulting, actuarial and other services, which frequently involve assumptions and estimates concerning future events. Given the long-tail nature of professional liability claims, E&O
matters often relate to services provided by the Company dating back many years. In each of our segments, E&O claims seek damages, including punitive and treble damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant and subject us to
potential liability for monetary damages, negative publicity, reputational harm and to diversion of personnel and management resources.

In establishing
liabilities for errors and omissions claims in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic No. 450-20 (Contingencies—Loss Contingencies), the Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel and an internal actuarial analysis to
estimate potential losses. A liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other
than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Nevertheless, given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that
could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.

To the extent that expected losses exceed our deductible in any policy year, the Company also records an asset for the amount that we expect to recover
under any available third-party insurance programs. The Company has varying levels of third-party insurance coverage, with policy limits and coverage terms varying significantly by policy year. The Company is not aware of coverage defenses or other
obstacles to coverage that would limit recoveries through policy year 2001-2002 in a material amount. Beginning in 2002, the availability of third-party insurance has declined.

Further, as more fully described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report, we are subject to legal proceedings, regulatory investigations and other
contingencies other than E&O claims which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign
laws and regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.

Our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, the European Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in which we operate. For example,
we are subject to regulation by foreign and domestic governments, regulatory agencies such as the SEC in the United States and the FSA in the United Kingdom, and self-regulatory organizations



such as FINRA, as described further above under Part I, Item 1 — Business (Regulation) of this report. Compliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our
operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the pending
anti-bribery law in the UK, local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, as well as various trade sanctions laws such as the various international legislative and regulatory requirements relating to trade with Iran.

As a publicly-traded company, we are subject to additional federal, state and other rules and regulations, including those required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 and the recently adopted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which will subject us to significant additional executive compensation and corporate governance requirements, many of which have yet to be implemented by the
SEC. Compliance with the requirements of these laws and regulations may be costly and adversely affect our business.

While we attempt to comply with all
applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or
that we will be able to comply with any future laws, regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those referred to above, we may be subject to investigations,
criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, loss of an operating license or approval, increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular
business or redress to clients. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, these matters could have a material
adverse effect on the Company by exposing us to negative publicity, reputational damage or harm to our client or employee relationships.

In most
jurisdictions, government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret or amend applicable laws and regulations, and have discretion to grant, renew and revoke various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities. Such authorities
may require the Company to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations. In some areas of our businesses, we act on the basis of our own or the industry’s interpretations of applicable laws or
regulations, which may conflict from state to state or country to country. In the event those interpretations eventually prove different from those of regulatory authorities, we might be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous
activities. Moreover, the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate. Recent changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to generate additional revenue
streams or enhance revenue streams. Any significant impairment of our ability to conduct our business as we historically have done could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Finally, government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could displace insurance or reinsurance currently available from the private market and
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Improper disclosure of personal data could result in
legal liability or harm our reputation.

In many jurisdictions, we may have certain obligations to maintain the security and privacy of our
clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal information of our employees, our individual customers, and our clients’ employees and retirement and other benefit plan participants. We maintain policies, procedures and
technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personal information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and
subject us to liability under our contracts, as well as laws and regulations, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.

Further, data privacy is
subject to frequently changing laws, rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement



processes in response to changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace, as well as the general risks
described above relating to our compliance systems and controls.

Financial Risks

Our pension obligations may cause the Company’s earnings and cash flows to fluctuate.

Volatility in equity and bond market conditions may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the Company’s pension trust assets and estimated future pension
liabilities. As a result, the Company’s financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the Company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding
with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the Company’s financial flexibility.

The Company has significant pension obligations to
its current and former employees, totaling approximately $11 billion at December 31, 2010. The magnitude of our worldwide pension plans means that our earnings and the funded status of our pension plans are comparatively sensitive to factors
such as equity and bond market returns, as well as the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, rates of inflation and mortality assumptions. In accordance with ASC Topic No 715, the Company reflects the over- or
under-funded amount of its pension plans as assets or liabilities, respectively. Variations in any of the preceding factors could cause significant fluctuation in our earnings as well as our shareholder’s equity from year to year and may result
in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and
political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity.

Global economic and
political conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve. In 2008 and 2009, the credit markets and the financial services industry experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy,
failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and foreign governments. These economic conditions have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial
institutions, and financial services entities in particular. The global economic crisis has had a significant effect on our Consulting segment in particular. Many of our clients have been reducing expenses, including amounts they spend on consulting
services. If these economic conditions persist or deteriorate, they could potentially have a significant impact on our operations.

These economic
conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do
not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Should it become necessary for us to further restructure our business, including reducing our work force, as a result of these
market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services, our ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected.

Financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations, investing activities
(including the financing of any future acquisitions), or financing activities.

Our cash investments, including those held in a fiduciary capacity, are
subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the recent global financial crisis. If the banking system or the fixed income, credit or equity markets deteriorate further or remain
volatile, the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected.



Credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational
risk.

Both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s downgraded the Company’s senior debt credit rating in late 2004 and S&P
announced a further downgrade in December 2007. Currently, the Company’s senior debt is rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB- by S&P. These ratings are the next-to-lowest investment grade rating for Moody’s, and the lowest
investment-grade rating for S&P.

If we need to raise capital in the future (for example, in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance
acquisitions or other initiatives), any further credit rating downgrade would increase our financing costs, and could limit our access to financing sources. Further, we believe that a downgrade to a rating below investment-grade could result in
greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures.

Our significant non-U.S. operations
expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business.

We are subject to exchange rate risk because some of our
subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies, and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Our U.S. operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in U.S. dollars.
In certain jurisdictions, however, our Risk and Insurance Services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies, but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency. Due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we are
subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations. Exchange rate risk could have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

Increased counterparty risk and changes in interest rates could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial
results.

As was evident in the recent financial crisis, counterparty risk can quickly escalate resulting in substantial trading and investment
losses for corporate and other investors. In addition, we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments, and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to
be low risk remain low.

We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in
needed amounts from our subsidiaries.

The Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating
subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt
obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses. In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to the Company, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends
on common stock.

Further, the Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the
U.S. Since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are made from the U.S., it is important to be able to access cash generated outside the U.S. Funds from the Company’s operating subsidiaries outside of the
U.S. are periodically repatriated to the U.S. via shareholder distributions and repayment of intercompany financing. A number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive, including, but
not limited to, foreign exchange rates and tax-related costs.

In the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the
reasons discussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate.



International Operations

We are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations.

We do business worldwide. In 2010, 56 percent of the Company’s total operating segment revenue was generated from operations outside the United States, and
over one-half of our employees are located outside the United States. We expect to expand our non-U.S. operations further.

The geographic breadth of our
activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks. These include, among others, risks relating to:

–

economic and political conditions in foreign countries, including the recent disruption in the global financial markets;

–

potential conflicts of interest that may arise as we expand the scope of our businesses and our client base;

–

international hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters and infrastructure disruptions;

–

local investment or other financial restrictions that foreign governments may impose;

–

potential costs and difficulties in complying, or monitoring compliance, with rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets
Control, the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or other U.S. laws and regulations applicable to business operations abroad;

–

limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S.
subsidiaries;

–

withholding or other taxes that foreign governments may impose on the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries;

–

potential transfer pricing-related tax exposures that may result from the allocation of U.S.-based costs that benefit our non-U.S. businesses;

–

the length of payment cycles and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, particularly in light of the increasing number of insolvencies in the
current economic environment and the numerous bankruptcy laws to which they are subject;

–

engaging and relying on third parties to perform services on behalf of the Company;

–

potential difficulties in monitoring employees in geographically dispersed locations; and

–

potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government
agencies, some of which may conflict with U.S. or other sources of law.

Our inability to successfully recover
should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other
natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an
event, our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems would provide us with an important advantage. Nevertheless, we could still experience near-term operational challenges with regard to
particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel.

Our operations, particularly within our Consulting segment, are
dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a



significant disruptive effect on our operations. We could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a
disaster recovery scenario.

We regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession.
However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially
interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.

Competitive Risks

Each
of the Company’s businesses operates in a highly competitive environment. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and results of operations will suffer.

As a global professional services firm, the Company experiences acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors, including our
geographic reach, the sophistication and quality of our services, our pricing relative to competitors and our customers’ option to self-insure or utilize internal resources instead of consultants. If we are unable to respond successfully to the
competition we face, our business and results of operations will suffer.

In our Risk and Insurance Services segment, we compete intensely against a wide
range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a global, regional, national or local scale for both client business and employee talent. We compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service
their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries, and with various other companies that provide risk-related services. The above competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a “syndicated”
or “distributed” approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services, whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client’s account.

In our Consulting segment, we compete for business and employee talent with numerous independent consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting,
information systems, technology and financial services firms around the world.

The loss of key professionals could hurt our ability
to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business.

Across all of our businesses, our personnel are crucial to developing
and retaining the client relationships on which our revenues depend. It is therefore very important for us to retain significant revenue-producing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them. We face numerous challenges
in this regard, including:

–

the intense competition for talent in all of our businesses;

–

the general mobility of professionals in our businesses; and

–

the difficulties we may face in offering compensation of a type and amount (including equity-based compensation) sufficient to attract, motivate and retain
valuable employees.

Losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or
expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing
company, some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services.

Consolidation in the
industries that we serve could adversely affect our business.

Companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and
other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If two or more of our current clients merge



or consolidate and combine their operations, it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients. If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies
on another provider for its services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work. The increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us. Any of these
possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business. Guy Carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace.

Our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes could adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

To remain competitive in many of our business areas, we must identify the most current technologies and
methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings. For example, Guy Carpenter’s risk-modeling services are increasingly dependent on implementing advanced software and data-compilation tools and Mercer’s ability to price its
outsourcing services competitively is highly dependent on the efficient and cost effective use of technology. If we do not make the correct technology choices or investments, or if our choices or investments are insufficiently prompt or
cost-effective, our business and results of operations could suffer.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

We face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses.

We have a history of making acquisitions, including a total of 26 acquisitions in the period 2008-2010 for aggregate purchase consideration of $1.3 billion. We have also exited various businesses, including the
sale of Putnam Investments Trust (“Putnam”) in August 2007 and the sale of Kroll in the third quarter of 2010. We expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy. Our success in this regard will depend on
our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue.

While we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be
accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations. Acquisitions involve special risks, including accounting, regulatory, compliance, information technology or human resources issues that could arise in connection
with, or as a result of, the acquisition of the acquired company; the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses; and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of
revenue, profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect. In addition, if in the future, the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions, or estimates about future
profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change, the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisition-related
intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts. Given the significant size of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets, a write-down of this sort could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations in any given period. As of December 31, 2010, the Company’s consolidated balance sheet reflected $6.8 billion of goodwill and intangible assets, representing approximately 45 percent of the Company’s total
consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows: Risk and Insurance Services, $4.7 billion and Consulting, $2.1 billion.

When we
dispose of businesses we are subject to the risk, contractually agreed or otherwise, of post-transaction liabilities. For example, as described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report,
we have retained certain contingent litigation liabilities relating to Putnam and Kroll.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR RISK AND INSURANCE SERVICES SEGMENT

Our Risk and Insurance Services segment, conducted through Marsh and Guy Carpenter, represented 54 percent of the Company’s total operating
segment revenue in 2010. Our business in this segment is subject to particular risks.



Results in our Risk and Insurance Services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline
in economic activity.

Demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises and falls as economic growth expands or slows. This dynamic
affects the level of commissions and fees generated by Marsh and Guy Carpenter. To the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions, they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage, as
applicable, which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue; and may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services, which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue. Moreover, insolvencies and combinations associated with
an economic downturn, especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Guy
Carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place.

Volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability.

A significant portion of our Risk and Insurance Services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. Our revenues and profitability
are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and
reinsurance markets.

In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by the
growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs. This trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “self-insure;” the use of so-called “captive” insurers; and the
advent of capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs. Further, the profitability of our Risk and Insurances Services segment depends in part on ensuring that our professionals are compensated not only for
insurance and reinsurance transactions, but for the increasing analytical services and advice that we provide. If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services, our margins and profitability could suffer.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR CONSULTING SEGMENT

Our
Consulting segment, conducted through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, represented 46 percent of our total operating segment revenue in 2010. Our businesses in this segment is subject to particular risks.

Demand for our services might decrease for various reasons, including a general economic downturn, a decline in a client’s or an
industry’s financial condition, or changes in government regulation.

Our Consulting segment has historically achieved significant annual
revenue growth. Despite this history, however, the recent global economic conditions have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions. Many of our clients, including financial institutions, corporations, governmental
entities and pension plans, have been reducing expenses, including amounts spent on consulting services. The evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients may challenge our ability to increase revenues and profitability and reduce demand
for our services. If the economy or markets in which we operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, demand for many of Mercer’s benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules, which drive our clients’ needs
for benefits-related services. For example, significant changes in government regulations affecting the value, use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans, defined
contribution plans, or defined benefit plans, may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of Mercer’s services.



Factors impacting defined benefit pension plans could adversely affect Mercer.

Mercer currently provides corporate, multi-employer and public clients with consulting and actuarial services relating to defined benefit pension
plans. The nature of our work, particularly our actuarial services, is complex, and involves numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events, including interest rates used to discount future liabilities, estimated rates of return for a
plan’s assets, healthcare cost trends or participants’ life expectancies. Clients dissatisfied with our services have brought, and may bring, claims against us. In addition, over the past several years, the funded status of defined benefit
pension plans has declined markedly. A number of Mercer’s clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for Mercer’s retirement business. These
developments could adversely affect Mercer’s business and operating results.

Our profitability may suffer if we are unable to
achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants.

The profitability of our Consulting businesses depends in part on
ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates (i.e., the percentage of our consultants’ working hours devoted to billable activities). Our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors, including:

–

our ability to transition consultants promptly from completed projects to new assignments, and to engage newly hired consultants quickly in revenue-generating
activities;

–

our ability to continually secure new business engagements, particularly because a portion of our work is project-based rather than recurring in nature;

–

our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and workforces;

–

our ability to manage attrition;

–

unanticipated changes in the scope of client engagements;

–

the potential for conflicts of interest that might require us to decline client engagements that we otherwise would have accepted;

–

our need to devote time and resources to sales, training, professional development and other non-billable activities;

–

the potential disruptive impact of acquisitions and dispositions; and

–

general economic conditions.

The factors
listed above, and therefore also our utilization rates for service personnel, have been adversely affected by recent macroeconomic conditions. If the utilization rate for our consulting professionals continues to decline, our profit margin and
profitability would suffer.

In addition, the profitability of our Consulting businesses depends on the prices we are able to charge for our services.
Our pricing power is affected by a number of factors, including:

–

clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services;

–

market demand for the services we provide;

–

our ability to develop new services and the introduction of new services by competitors;

–

the pricing policies of our competitors;

–

changes in the extent to which our clients develop in-house or other capabilities to perform the services that they might otherwise purchase from us; and

–

general economic conditions.

Our pricing has
also been adversely affected by the recent economic crisis. If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services, our margins and profitability could suffer.



Our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly.

Quarterly variations in revenues and operating results at Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group may occur due to several factors. These include:

–

the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter;

–

the unpredictability of the timing and amount of success fees;

–

the possibility that clients may decide to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress;

–

fluctuations in consultant hiring and utilization rates and clients’ ability to terminate engagements without penalty;

–

seasonality at Mercer due to the impact of regulatory deadlines and other timing factors to which our clients are subject;

–

the success of our strategic acquisitions, alliances or investments;

–

macroeconomic factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and global securities markets, particularly in the case of Mercer, where fees in
certain business lines are derived from the value of assets under management (or administration) and declines in global securities markets could result in a decline in revenue and profitability of these business lines; and

–

general economic conditions, since results of operations in our Consulting businesses are directly affected by the levels of business activity of our clients,
which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve.

A significant portion of
total operating expenses at Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group is relatively fixed. Therefore, a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in
quarterly operating results for these businesses.

If we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of
operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the
amounts they owe us for work performed. We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients.
Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or
default on their payment obligations to us. The increasing number of insolvencies in the current economic environment and the numerous bankruptcy laws to which they are subject could also adversely affect our ability to collect receivables or
unbilled services. Timely collection of client balances depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in
collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our
cash flows could be adversely affected.

Item 2.      Properties.

Marsh & McLennan Companies and its subsidiaries maintain their corporate headquarters in and around New York City. We also maintain other offices around
the world, primarily in leased space. In certain circumstances we may have space that we sublet to third parties, depending upon our needs in particular locations.

Marsh & McLennan Companies and certain of its subsidiaries own, directly and indirectly through special-purpose subsidiaries, a 55% condominium interest covering approximately 900,000 square feet in a
44-story building in New York City. This real estate serves as the Company’s New York headquarters and is occupied primarily by the Company and its affiliates for general corporate use. The remaining 45% condominium interest in the 1166
Property is owned by an unaffiliated third party. The Company’s owned interest is financed by a 30-year loan that is non-recourse to the Company (except in the event of certain prohibited actions) and secured by a first mortgage lien on the
condominium interest and a first priority assignment of leases and rents. In the event (1) the Company is downgraded below B/B2 (Stable) by any of S&P, Fitch and Moody’s or (2) an event of default has occurred and is continuing,
the Company would be obligated to pre-fund certain reserve accounts relating to the mortgaged property, including a rent reserve account in an amount equal to three months rent for the entire occupancy of the mortgaged property.

(a)

Includes the impact of net restructuring costs of $141 million, $243 million, $328 million, $98 million and $86 million in 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, appearing under Amended Item 7 of
this report, for discussion of significant items affecting our results of operations in 2010, 2009 and 2008.



Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.

General

Marsh &
McLennan Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a global professional services firm providing advice and solutions in the areas of risk, strategy, and human capital. The Company’s subsidiaries include Marsh, which
provides risk and insurance services; Guy Carpenter, which provides reinsurance services; Mercer, which provides human resource and related financial advice and services; and Oliver Wyman Group, which provides management consulting and other
services. The Company’s approximately 51,000 employees worldwide provide analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in over 100 countries.

The Company’s business segments are based on the services provided. Risk and Insurance Services includes risk management and insurance and reinsurance broking and services, provided primarily by Marsh and Guy
Carpenter. Consulting, which comprises the activities of Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, includes human resource consulting and related investment and outsourcing services, and specialized management, economic and brand consulting services.

In the first quarter of 2010, Kroll completed the sale of Kroll Laboratory Specialists (KLS) and on August 3, 2010, the Company completed the sale
of Kroll to Altegrity for cash consideration of $1.13 billion. The account balances and activities of Kroll and KLS were segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. During the second quarter of 2009, Kroll sold Kroll Government Services (“KGS”), which has been classified as a discontinued operation. In 2008, the Company disposed of its U.S. and U.K. restructuring
businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts.

With the Kroll disposition completed in August 2010, along with the
previous disposals of other businesses between 2008 and 2010, the Company has now divested its entire Risk Consulting and Technology segment. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, based on the terms and conditions of the
divestitures of the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring businesses (“CARG”) in 2008, the Company determined it has “continuing involvement” in those businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e.
Therefore classification of CARG as discontinued operations is not appropriate, and their financial results in the current and prior periods are included in operating income. The runoff of the Company’s involvement in the CARG businesses is now
managed by the Company’s corporate departments, and consequently, the financial results of these businesses are now included in “Corporate” for segment reporting purposes.

We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of segment financial results. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is
included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8 in this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements.

This MD&A contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Information Concerning
Forward-Looking Statements” at the outset of this report.

Significant Developments

The Company’s historical financial information should be viewed in light of the significant developments discussed below.

Ÿ

The sale of KLS in the first quarter of 2010 and Kroll in August of 2010. Both businesses have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods
presented. The sale of Kroll Government Services (“KGS”) in the second quarter of 2009. The loss on the disposal and the results of KGS operations are included in discontinued operations.



Ÿ

Resolution in June 2010 of the litigation brought by the Alaska Retirement Management Board (“ARMB”) on behalf of two Alaska benefit plans against
Mercer, relating to work in the period 1992 to 2004. This settlement, in which Mercer expressly denied liability, resolved all claims against Mercer by the ARMB and State of Alaska related to this matter. Under terms of the settlement, Mercer paid
$500 million, of which $100 million was covered by insurance.

Ÿ

The settlement in the fourth quarter of 2009 of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits filed in 2004. As a result, the Company recorded a $205 million
net charge in December 2009, which is tax deductible. Without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company agreed to pay a total of $435 million to settle both lawsuits and received $230 million from its insurance carriers. A group of
stockholders, representing approximately 4% of eligible shares, initially indicated their intent to opt out of this settlement, but subsequently agreed to opt in to the settlement for an additional payment of $25 million. This additional settlement
cost was accrued in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. All claims related to these lawsuits are now fully resolved.

Ÿ

The impact of acquisitions in the Risk and Insurance Services segment. In the first quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired Haake Companies, Inc., one of the largest
insurance broking firms in the Midwest region and Thomas Rutherfoord, Inc., one of the largest insurance broking firms in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. In the second quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired HSBC Insurance Brokers Ltd.
(“HIBL”), an international provider of risk intermediary and risk advisory services and the Bostonian Group Insurance Agency, Inc. and Bostonian Solutions, Inc. (collectively the “Bostonian Group”), one of the largest regional
insurance brokerages in New England. In the fourth quarter of 2010 Marsh acquired Strategic Benefits Solutions, Inc. (“SBS”), a Georgia-based benefits brokerage and consulting firm and Trion Group, Inc. (“Trion”), an insurance
consultant and broker in the United States that was the largest privately held employee benefits specialist in the nation. In September 2009, Marsh acquired International Advisory Services, Ltd., the largest independent manager of captives and
third-party insurance companies in Bermuda. In December 2009, Marsh acquired the NIA Group, LLC, one of the largest independent insurance agencies in the Northeast and the 34

th

largest agency in the U.S. In April 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of John B. Collins Associates, Inc.,
previously the fifth-largest reinsurance intermediary in the U.S. and seventh-largest in the world. In October 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of London-based specialty reinsurance broker Rattner Mackenzie Limited from HCC Insurance
Holdings, Inc. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Ÿ

The impact of acquisitions made in the Consulting segment. In July 2010, Mercer acquired Innovative Process Administration (“IPA”), a provider of
health and benefit recordkeeping and employee enrollment technology. In August 2010, Mercer acquired ORC Worldwide, a premier provider of HR knowledge, data and solutions for professionals in numerous industries. In January 2011, Mercer acquired
Hammond Associates, the third largest investment consulting company for endowments and foundations in the U.S.



Consolidated Results of Operations

Consolidated
operating income was $939 million in 2010 compared with $778 million in the prior year. The 2010 results include a $400 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the resolution of the litigation brought by the ARMB and restructuring and other
noteworthy charges of $139 million. The 2009 results include a $230 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits filed in 2004 and restructuring and other noteworthy items of $264
million. Excluding these charges, consolidated operating income was $1.5 billion in 2010 compared with $1.3 billion in 2009.

Risk and Insurance Services
operating income increased $176 million to $972 million in 2010 compared with 2009, or 22%, resulting from revenue growth at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter, as well as a decrease of $77 million in restructuring and related charges.

Consulting operating income decreased $276 million to $129 million in 2010 primarily due to the $400 million net charge related to the ARMB litigation settlements,
partly offset by lower restructuring and other noteworthy items of $48 million. Excluding these items, Consulting operating income increased $76 million, or 16%.

Corporate and other results were $162 million of expense in 2010 compared to net expense of $423 million in 2009. In 2010, Corporate and other expenses include restructuring and other noteworthy charges of $13
million, partly offset by $10 million of payments received by the Company related to CARG. In 2009, Corporate expenses include a net charge of $230 million related to settlements of the class action lawsuits described above and $33 million of
restructuring and other noteworthy charges. Excluding these items, Corporate and other expenses decreased $1 million in 2010 compared with 2009.

Discontinued operations include the operating results of Kroll for all years presented, including goodwill impairment charges of $315 million and $504 million in
2009 and 2008, respectively, the gain on the sale of Kroll and KLS in 2010 of $282 million, insurance recoveries of $16 million related to Putnam market-timing related matters in 2010 and the loss on the sale of KGS in 2009. Discontinued operations
also include the accretion of interest related to an indemnity for uncertain tax positions provided as part of the purchase by Great-West Life Co. Inc., of Putnam Investments Trust from the Company in August 2007.



Consolidated net income attributable to the Company was $855 million in 2010, compared with $227 million in 2009.

Consolidated Revenues and Expenses

The Company
conducts business in many countries, as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact period-to-period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may impact period-to-period
comparisons of revenue. Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions on the Company’s operating
revenues is as follows:

revenue information for certain of the components presented above:

*

Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.

Revenue

Consolidated revenue for 2010 increased 7% to $10.6
billion compared with $9.8 billion in 2009, reflecting a 3% increase in underlying revenue, a 3% increase due to acquisitions and a 1% positive impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 9%
in 2010 compared with 2009. Underlying revenue increased 2% for the total Risk and Insurance Services segment, reflecting 2% increases in both Marsh and Guy Carpenter, partially offset by a 21% decrease in fiduciary interest income. Consulting
revenue increased 5%, resulting from a 5% increase in Mercer and a 6% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 3% reflecting a 2% increase in Mercer and a 7% increase in the Oliver Wyman Group.



Consolidated revenue for 2009 decreased 8% to $9.8 billion compared with $10.7 billion in 2008, reflecting a 3%
decrease in underlying revenue and a 4% negative impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 3% in 2009 compared with 2008. Underlying revenue decreased 1% for the total Risk and Insurance
Services segment, reflecting an 8% increase in Guy Carpenter, which was more than offset by a 1% decrease in Marsh and a 60% decrease in fiduciary interest income. Consulting revenue decreased 11%, resulting from a 9% decrease at Mercer and a 17%
decline at the Oliver Wyman Group. On an underlying basis, revenue decreased 7% reflecting a 4% decrease in Mercer, and a 15% decrease in the Oliver Wyman Group.

Expenses

Consolidated operating expenses increased 6% in 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Expenses
in 2010 include the $400 net settlement at Mercer. In 2009, the Company recorded a $230 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits filed in 2004. Restructuring and other
noteworthy charges in 2010 of $139 million decreased $155 million from charges of $294 million in 2009. Excluding these charges, expenses were $9.1 billion in 2010 compared with $8.5 billion in 2009, an increase of 6%. The increase reflects a 1%
increase due to the impact of foreign currency exchange, a 3% increase due to the impact of acquisitions and a 2% increase in underlying expenses. The increase in underlying expenses is due to higher pension, travel and entertainment, outsourcing
and other outside services costs.

Consolidated operating expenses decreased 10% in 2009 compared with the same period in 2008. In 2009, the Company
recorded a $230 million charge, net of insurance recoveries, for the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits filed in 2004. Restructuring and other noteworthy charges in 2009 of $294 million decreased $138 million from charges
of $432 million in 2008. Excluding these charges, expenses were $8.6 billion in 2009 compared with $9.6 billion in 2008, or a decrease of 11%. The decrease reflects a 4% decline due to the impact of foreign currency exchange, a 1% decline due to the
impact of dispositions and a 5% decline in underlying expenses. The decrease in underlying expenses is due to generally lower expenses, primarily in base salary, employee benefits, travel and entertainment, outside services, facilities, equipment
and recoverable expenses from clients.

Restructuring

Actions Initiated in 2010

In 2010, the Company implemented restructuring actions which resulted in costs
totaling $114 million, primarily related to severance and benefits, and costs for future rent and other real estate costs. Approximately $63 million of these costs related to cost reduction activities for acquisitions made in 2010. These costs were
incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance Services—$81 million comprising Marsh—$65 million (acquisition related—$46 million) and Guy Carpenter—$16 million (acquisition related—$6 million); Mercer—$25 million (acquisition
related—$11 million); and Corporate—$8 million. These activities resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions at Marsh, 80 positions at Guy Carpenter, 240 positions at Mercer and 70 positions at Corporate. The annualized cost
savings from these actions are expected to be approximately $100 million.

Actions Initiated Prior to 2010

Prior to 2010, the Company implemented several restructuring and cost-savings initiatives related to firm-wide infrastructure, organization structure and operating
the Company’s business processes. During 2010, the Company incurred restructuring costs of $27 million in connection with actions initiated in prior years, primarily due to severance and related benefits and adjustments to the estimated future
rent and real estate costs related to previously vacated space.

Businesses Exited

In February 2010, Kroll sold KLS, its substance abuse testing business for $110 million. On August 3, 2010, the Company completed the sale of Kroll to Altegrity for $1.13 billion. The account balances and



activities of Kroll and KLS have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented. The gain on the sale of Kroll and
related tax benefits and the after- tax loss on the disposal of KLS, along with Kroll’s and KLS’s 2010 and comparative results of operations are included in discontinued operations.

During the second quarter of 2009, Kroll sold KGS. The results of operations and the loss on sale of KGS are included in discontinued operations.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company sold its U.S. and U.K. restructuring businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts. Based on the terms and conditions of the disposals,
the Company determined it has “continuing involvement” in these businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. Therefore, the results of these businesses, including the loss on disposal, are included in
continuing operations. The Company recorded a loss of $28 million on the disposition of the U.K. Corporate Advisory and Restructuring businesses. The net assets of these U.K. businesses were written-off upon transfer to the new owners. The Company
will earn royalties on future revenue of these businesses over the next two years. The royalties will be recognized when earned under the terms of the contract and when collectability is reasonably assured. Through December 31, 2010, the
Company has recognized $11 million of royalty payments related to the U.K. businesses. The transfer of the U.S. restructuring business was financed with a seller note. If the Company receives interest and principal payments as scheduled for the U.S.
business, it will recover the value of the net assets transferred to the new owners and recognize a gain on the disposal of $18 million.

In March 2010,
the Company agreed to suspend collections of interest and principal payments on the seller financed note related to the U.S. restructuring business. The payments received prior to March 2010 were sufficient to allow the Company to recover the value
of net assets transferred and recognize $1 million of gain. Although it is uncertain whether future payments will be received under the revised terms of the note, the Company has no remaining net investment in the U.S. restructuring business. Any
future collections will be recognized as income, if and when received.

Risk and Insurance Services

In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds,
insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services
and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter.

Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services
primarily through fees paid by clients and/or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular
insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves
and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds/reinsureds. In many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the types and amounts
of risks to be analyzed by the Company and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. The trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next will therefore be affected by changes in premium rate levels,
fluctuations in client risk retention, and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients.

Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of
fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments
varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of



which vary from time to time. For presentation purposes, fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of Marsh and Guy Carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown
in the revenue by segments charts earlier in this MD&A.

The results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are presented below:

Revenue

Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services increased 9% in 2010 compared with 2009 reflecting a 2%
increase on an underlying basis, a 6% increase from acquisitions, and a 1% increase from the impact of foreign currency exchange translation.

In Marsh,
revenue in 2010 was $4.7 billion, an increase of 10% from the same quarter of the prior year, reflecting 2% growth in underlying revenue, a 6% increase from acquisitions and a 1% increase resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation.
The underlying revenue increase of 2% was achieved despite the economic environment and the soft pricing environment in the global property-casualty insurance market. Marsh increased revenues in all its geographies, reflecting new business growth of
8%. Underlying revenue increased 8% in Latin America, 7% in Asia Pacific, 1% in U.S. / Canada and 3% in EMEA.

Marsh completed several strategic
acquisitions during 2010. In the first quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired Haake Companies, Inc., one of the largest insurance agencies in the Midwest, and Thomas Rutherfoord, Inc., one of the largest insurance broking firms in the Southeast and
mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. In the second quarter of 2010, Marsh completed the acquisition of HIBL, an international provider of risk intermediary and risk advisory services and the Bostonian Group, one of the largest regional insurance
brokerages in New England. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired Trion, a large U.S. private benefit specialist and SBS, a Georgia-based benefits brokerage and consulting firm. In January 2011, Marsh acquired RJF Agencies, one of the largest
independent insurance agencies in the upper Midwest. All of the acquisitions noted above, except HIBL relate to the Marsh & McLennan Agency. The Marsh & McLennan Agency acquisitions completed in 2010 have added approximately $200
million of annualized revenue.

In March 2010, Marsh announced its approach to market remuneration and contingent commissions in the U.S. As previously
announced, Marsh and McLennan Agency and Marsh’s affinity, sponsored program and personal lines businesses accept contingent commissions. Marsh does not accept contingent commissions on any placement for any U.S. clients served by the
firm’s core brokerage operation. Marsh will continue to collect enhanced commissions with respect to its core brokerage operations, which are fixed in advance of insurance transactions and are not related to volume, retention, growth or
profitability.

Guy Carpenter’s revenue increased 7% to $975 million in 2010 compared with 2009, or 2% on an underlying basis. The increase in
underlying revenue was due to continued strong new business and high client retention over the past two years. In April 2009, Guy Carpenter acquired John B. Collins Associates, Inc., previously the fifth-largest reinsurance intermediary in the U.S.
and seventh-largest in the world. In October 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of London-based specialty reinsurance broker Rattner Mackenzie Limited from HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc.



Fiduciary interest income was $45 million in 2010, a decrease of 16% compared with 2009, driven by lower interest
rates.

Revenue in Risk and Insurance Services decreased 3% in 2009 compared with 2008, reflecting a 4% negative impact of foreign currency exchange
fluctuations, a 1% decrease on an underlying basis partly offset by a 2% increase from acquisitions.

In Marsh, revenue in 2009 decreased 5% from 2008,
reflecting a 4% negative impact of foreign currency translation and a 1% decrease in underlying revenue. These results reflected the difficult economic environment, in addition to the pressure on insurance premium levels, commissions and fees. On a
geographic basis, Marsh’s International revenue increased 2% on an underlying basis reflecting a 9% increase in Latin America and a 5% increase in Asia Pacific, reflecting strong new business growth on a global basis, partly offset by a
decrease of 4% in the U.S. / Canada region.

Guy Carpenter’s revenue of $911 million in 2009 increased 13% compared with the prior year, or 8% on an
underlying basis. The increase in underlying revenue was primarily due to higher client revenue retention and an increase in new business. As noted above, in April 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of John B. Collins Associates, Inc. and
in October 2009, completed the acquisition of Rattner Mackenzie Limited. These acquisitions contributed 7% to the year-over-year revenue growth in 2009.

Fiduciary interest income for the Risk and Insurance Services segment was $54 million in 2009, a decrease of 61% compared with the same period of 2008, driven by
lower interest rates.

Expense

Expenses in the
Risk and Insurance Services segment increased 7% in 2010 compared with 2009, reflecting a 6% increase from acquisitions and a 1% increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Expenses on an underlying basis were flat, as higher pension
related expenses, travel and entertainment, and outsourcing costs were offset by a $77 million decrease in restructuring and related charges.

Expenses
in the Risk and Insurance Services segment decreased 10% in 2009, compared with the prior year. Underlying expenses decreased 8% with the remaining reduction due to the impact of foreign currency exchange of 4% partly offset by an increase of 1% due
to the impact of acquisitions. The decline in underlying expenses reflects lower compensation and benefit costs due to reductions in the number of employees as a result of restructuring activities and a decrease in other operating cost categories.
The decrease in other expenses includes a reduction in professional liability costs reflecting the impact of a $33 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2008 and a reduction of $39 million in net settlement, legal and regulatory costs
(reduced by insurance recoveries in 2009). The expense decrease also reflects lower restructuring and related charges in 2009 as compared with 2008.

Consulting

The Company conducts business in its Consulting
segment through two main business groups. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of retirement, health & benefits, rewards, talent & communications, outsourcing, and investment
consulting & management. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services.

The major component of
revenue in the Consulting segment business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer, principally through its health & benefits line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies
for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer’s investment management business and certain of Mercer’s outsourcing businesses consists
principally of fees based on assets under management or administration.

Revenue in the Consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global
economic conditions, including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets. Revenue is also affected by competition



due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in
interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services, which are expected to increase over time, are significantly affected by securities market
performance.

The results of operations for the Consulting segment are presented below:

Revenue

Consulting revenue in 2010 increased 5% compared with 2009, or 3% on an underlying basis. Mercer’s revenue was $3.5 billion in 2010, an
increase of 5%. On an underlying basis, Mercer’s revenue increased 2%. Within Mercer’s consulting lines, revenue on an underlying basis in 2010 was flat compared with 2009, reflecting increases of 5% in health and benefits and 2% in
rewards, talent & communications, offset by a 4% decline in retirement. The growth in health and benefits was driven by increases in all geographies. The increase in rewards, talent & communications was driven by a resurgence of demand
for compensation surveys partially offset by lower rewards and talent consulting assignments concentrated in the first half of the year. Outsourcing revenue increased 3% on an underlying basis, driven by new client wins primarily in Australia.
Investment consulting & management revenue increased 16% on an underlying basis, due to strong growth in all geographies. Oliver Wyman’s revenue increased 6% to $1.4 billion in 2010, or 7% on an underlying basis, driven by double-digit
revenue growth within its financial services practice. Other areas, including the healthcare, transportation and consumer sectors also generated double-digit revenue growth.

Consulting revenue in 2009 decreased 11% compared with the same period in 2008, or 7% on an underlying basis. Due to the difficult economic conditions, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman experienced decreased demand for
consulting services in 2009. Mercer’s revenue decreased 9%, or 4% on an underlying basis, reflecting decreases in underlying revenue in consulting and outsourcing of 4% and 6%, respectively, partly offset by an increase in investment consulting
and management of 6%. Within Mercer’s consulting lines, underlying revenue in retirement decreased 1% versus prior year, health and benefits decreased 1% and rewards, talent & communications decreased 17%. Oliver Wyman’s revenue
decreased 17%, or 15% on an underlying basis, compared with the prior year.

Expense

Consulting expenses in 2010 increased 12% to $4.7 billion, or 10% on an underlying basis. Mercer recorded a net $400 million charge related to the Alaska settlement in 2010 and in 2009 recorded incremental costs of
$30 million related to a professional liability settlement. Excluding these charges, expenses increased 3% on an underlying basis. This increase reflects the impact of higher pension related costs, meeting and training costs, recruitment and asset
based fees partly offset by lower severance, restructuring and recoverable expenses from clients.

Consulting expenses decreased 9% in 2009 compared with
the same period in 2008, reflecting a 4% decrease from the impact of foreign exchange rates and a 6% decrease on an underlying basis. The decline in underlying expenses reflects a decrease in base salaries and employee benefits due to decreased
staff levels, along with cost reductions in all discretionary expense categories and lower recoverable expenses from clients. These decreases were partly offset by an increase in professional liability costs of approximately $30 million, primarily
reflecting a legal settlement at Mercer, and higher severance costs at Oliver Wyman due to capacity reductions.



Corporate and Other

With the disposition of Kroll in August 2010, along with previous divestiture transactions between 2008 and 2010, the Company has now divested its entire Risk Consulting and Technology segment. As described in Note
1 to the consolidated financial statements, based on the terms and conditions of the divestitures of the CARG businesses in 2008, the Company determined it has “continuing involvement” in those businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. Therefore, classification of the CARG businesses as discontinued operations is not appropriate, and their financial results in the current and prior periods are included in operating income. The runoff of the
Company’s involvement in the CARG businesses is now managed by the Company’s corporate departments, and consequently, the financial results of these businesses are now included in “Corporate” for segment reporting purposes.

The following results of Corporate and Other includes the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring operations:

(a)

Before intercompany eliminations

Corporate expenses in 2010 were
$172 million compared to $420 million in 2009. The decrease is due to the impact of a $230 million net charge incurred in 2009 related to the settlement of the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits. The decrease in Corporate expense in 2010
compared to 2009 also reflects the impact of lower restructuring charges partly offset by higher consulting fees. The decrease in Corporate Advisory and Restructuring expenses in 2010 is due to the impact of $10 million of payments received in 2010
related to the disposal of this unit in 2008 compared with $1 million in 2009. These payments are classified as a recovery of expenses previously incurred as a result of the disposal transaction.

Corporate expenses in 2009 were $420 million compared to $255 million in 2008. Expenses in 2009 include a $230 million charge related to the settlement of the
securities and ERISA class action lawsuits described above. Restructuring and related charges in 2009 were $31 million compared with $85 million in 2008. Excluding these charges, expenses would have decreased 6%. This decrease is due to lower
consulting and legal fees in 2009 compared to 2008. Expenses for the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring business reflect a goodwill impairment charge of $36 million in 2008.

Discontinued Operations

On August 3, 2010, the Company completed its sale of Kroll to Altegrity for cash
proceeds of $1.13 billion. In the first quarter of 2010, Kroll completed the sale of KLS. The account balances and activities of Kroll and KLS have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets at December 31, 2009. The gain on the sale of Kroll and related tax benefits and the after-tax loss on the sale of KLS, along with Kroll’s and KLS’s 2010 and comparative results of operations are included in discontinued
operations.

Discontinued operations in 2010 and 2009 includes the accretion of interest related to an indemnity for uncertain tax positions provided as
part of the purchase by Great-West Lifeco, Inc. of Putnam Investments Trust from the Company in August 2007. Discontinued operations in 2010 includes $16 million for insurance recoveries for costs incurred in prior years related to Putnam.

In the second quarter of 2009 Kroll completed the sale of KGS. The loss on the sale of KGS and comparative results of operations are included in
discontinued operations.



Results of discontinued operations in 2008 include the operating results of Kroll, KLS and KGS and the effects of
three other discontinued operations—Putnam, Mediservice and Kroll Crucible—which are discussed in more detail below.

With regard to Putnam,
discontinued operations in 2008 includes (1) the impact of immaterial corrections and other adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2007 tax provision related to the transaction, (2) adjustments to the tax provision to reflect differences
between tax returns filed in 2008 and the initial estimated provisions, and (3) interest on liabilities for certain tax-related indemnities provided as part of the transaction. In the first quarter of 2008, Marsh completed the sale of
Mediservice, a claims administration operation in Brazil. The gain on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, Kroll completed the sale of Kroll Crucible (“Crucible”), a
division of its government services operation. The loss on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in 2008.

Summarized
Statements of Income data for discontinued operations is as follows:

(a)

Includes goodwill impairment charges of $315 million and $504 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively.

(b)

Includes gain on sale of Kroll and the gain on the sale of KLS in 2010 and a loss on the sale of Kroll Government Services in 2009.

(c)

The income tax credit related to the disposal of discontinued operations for 2010 primarily represents the recognition of tax benefits related to the sale of Kroll, partly offset
by a tax provision of $36 million related to the sale of KGS.

Other Corporate Items

Interest

Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $20 million in 2010 compared with $17 million
in 2009. The increase is primarily due to higher non-U.S. interest rate yields in 2010 compared to 2009. Interest expense was $233 million in 2010 compared with $241 million in 2009. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the maturity
of $550 million of senior notes in the third quarter of 2010.

Interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to $17 million in 2009, compared with
$47 million in 2008. The decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates in 2009 compared with the prior year. Interest expense of $241 million in 2009 increased $21 million from the prior year. This increase is primarily due to
the pre-funding in the first quarter of the $400 million of senior notes that matured in June 2009, the higher interest rate on the new bonds compared with those that matured, as well as higher interest expense associated with acquisition related
liabilities. The Company used the proceeds of the newly issued senior notes to fund the maturity of $400 million of senior notes in June 2009.



Investment Income (Loss)

In 2010, investment income was $43 million compared with a loss of $2 million in 2009. The increase reflects the impact of mark-to-market gains in 2010 on Risk Capital Holdings’ private equity investments
compared to losses in 2009, and gains realized from the sale of equity securities in 2010.

In 2009, investment losses were $2 million compared with a
$12 million loss in the prior year. The decrease reflects lower mark-to-market declines on Risk Capital Holdings’ private equity investments recorded in 2009 compared with 2008, and gains realized from the sale of equity securities in 2009.

Income Taxes

The Company’s consolidated
effective tax rate in 2010 was 26.5%. The tax rate reflects foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate.

The Company’s
consolidated effective tax rate in 2009 was 3.8%. The tax rate reflects reductions relating to a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The decrease in
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from expiring statutes of limitations, audit settlements and changes in estimates.

The
Company’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2008 was 22.9%. The tax rate reflects foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate. It also reflects a federal benefit on deferred state taxes, largely offset by other deferred tax
adjustments.

The lower tax rate generally attributed to the Company’s foreign operations reflects income taxed at rates lower than the 35% U.S.
federal tax rate, net of the U.S. tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings. The reduced effective tax rate primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the U.S., enhanced by planning that further reduces the impact of
taxes worldwide. Under current U.S. tax law, the Company anticipates its non-U.S. operations will continue to incur taxes at rates under 35%, although the percentage impact on the tax rate is expected to moderate as increases in U.S. pretax income
change the geographic mix of income.

Nevertheless, the effective tax rate is expected to remain significantly variable for the foreseeable future. The
rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company’s earnings, which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate. This also could result in foreign tax credit carryforwards arising in future periods for which a
valuation allowance may be required. Losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances affecting the rate, depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax
assets. The tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation.

The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable. The Company and Marsh have been profitable
globally. However, tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings. In the United States, certain groups within the Company,
which file on a combined basis, and certain entities within Marsh’s operations, which file on a separate entity basis, incurred losses for the last two years as well as the current year. The Company assessed the realizability of its domestic
deferred tax assets, particularly state deferred tax assets of Marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns, state deferred tax assets of all of the Company domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the Company
files a unitary or combined state tax return, and foreign tax credit carryforwards in the Company’s consolidated U.S. federal tax return. When making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31,
2010, the Company considered all available evidence, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. The evidence considered included (i) the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial
reporting losses, (ii) actions completed that are designed to reduce capacity and adjust to lower demand in the current economic environment, (iii) profit trends evidenced by recent improvements in the Company’s and Marsh’s
operating performance, (iv) the nonrecurring nature of some of the items



that contributed to the losses, (v) the carryforward periods for the net operating losses (“NOLs”) and foreign tax credit carryforwards, (vi) the sources and timing of future
taxable income, giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified, and (vii) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate utilization of NOLs. Based on its assessment,
the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more
likely than not to be realized. In the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods, additional valuation allowances of up to approximately $250 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets. The
realization of the remaining U.S. federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to U.S. profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future earnings from the Company’s profitable global operations. In addition, when making
its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010, the Company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses, including other
U.S. entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries, and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate.

Changes in tax laws or
tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, such as the recent proposal by President Obama’s Administration, if enacted, could have a
significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s liquidity needs are primarily for operating expenses, servicing debt, funding pension obligations, paying dividends on outstanding stock, funding acquisitions and capital expenditures. As a
holding company, the Company’s primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from operating subsidiaries. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows.

Cash on our consolidated balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are
segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company.

Operating Cash Flows

The Company
generated $722 million of cash from operations in 2010 compared with $640 million in 2009. These amounts reflect the net income reported by the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments and the disposition of
businesses, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate, primarily, to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. Cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing
cash flows. In December 2009, the Company paid $435 million into settlement funds related to the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits described above. Through December 31, 2009, the Company had collected $163 million of the total $230
million recovery from its insurers and the remaining $67 million was collected in January 2010.

On June 11, 2010, the Company resolved the
litigation brought by the Alaska Retirement Management Board (“ARMB”) on behalf of two Alaska benefit plans against Mercer, relating to work in the period 1992 to 2004. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Mercer paid $500 million,
of which $100 million was covered by insurance. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $277 million related to the disposition of Kroll and a $160 million tax benefit related to the cost of the Alaska Settlement. Approximately $50 million of the tax
benefits related to the Kroll disposition were realized during 2010 and approximately $230 million is expected to be realized in the first half of 2011.

Pension Related Items

During the third quarter of 2010, the
Company contributed $200 million to its U.S. Retirement Plan. The Company realized a tax benefit on this contribution of approximately $70 million in 2010. During 2010,



the Company contributed $221 million to its U.S. pension plans (including the $200 million discussed above) and approximately $237 million to non-U.S. pension plans, compared with $22 million for
U.S. plans and $400 million for non-U.S. plans in 2009.

The Company’s expected funding for its U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans in
2011 is approximately $20 million and $300 million, respectively. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in
U.S. and applicable foreign laws. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan for 2010 or 2011. Funding requirements for non-U.S. plans vary by country. Contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based
on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ from measurements under U.S. GAAP. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or
liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of the Company’s cash flows, including dividends, investments and share repurchases.

During 2010, the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets experienced investment gains of 14.4% in the U.S. and 13.5% in the U.K., our largest
plan.

Pension liabilities are impacted by, among other things, the discount rate set as of year-end. In addition, the year-over-year change in the
funded status of the plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of Company contributions, if any. Unrecognized actuarial
losses at December 31, 2010 were approximately $1.3 billion for the U.S. plans and $2.3 billion for the non-U.S. plans. Over the past several years, the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively,
by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. In 2008, severe downturns in the global equity markets resulted in market declines of 18% in the U.S. and 14% in the U.K. (our largest plan). This was partly offset by asset returns which
exceeded the assumed rates of return in 2009 and 2010 in both the U.S. and the U.K. In addition, the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities declined in the U.S. in each of the last three years. A decline in the discount rate increases the
measured plan liability, resulting in actuarial losses. In the U.K., asset losses in 2008 were partly offset by an increase in the discount rate. However, the discount rate in the U.K. declined in each of the last two years.

Overall, the Company’s pension expense is expected to increase in 2011 by approximately $60 million before the partly-offsetting impacts on bonuses and other
incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates.

The Company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans,
including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed below under Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies. For additional information regarding the Company’s retirement plans, see Note 8 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Financing Cash Flows

Net cash used for financing activities was $1.1 billion in 2010 compared with $464 million of net cash used for financing activities in 2009. The Company reduced outstanding debt by approximately $550 million, $10
million and $260 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Debt

During 2010, the Company’s 5.15% ten-year fixed rate $550 million senior notes matured. The Company used a portion of the cash received from the Kroll disposition to fund the maturity of those notes.

During 2009, the Company’s 7.125% ten-year $400 million bond matured. The Company used cash on hand as well as the proceeds from the issuance of
9.25% ten-year $400 million senior notes in the first quarter to manage liquidity, including the funding of the maturing notes.



During 2008, the Company’s 3.625% five-year fixed rate $250 million senior notes matured. The Company used cash
on hand to manage liquidity, including the repayment of these notes.

In the first quarter of 2009, Marsh acquired the remaining minority interest of a
previously majority owned entity for total purchase consideration of $47 million reflecting cash paid of $24 million and future consideration of $23 million, of which $15 million was paid in the first quarter of 2010.

On October 23, 2009, the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new $1.0 billion multi-currency three-year unsecured revolving credit
facility, which replaced the $1.2 billion facility that was previously in place. The interest rate on this facility varies based upon the Company’s credit ratings and the Company’s credit default swap levels, subject to floors and caps.
The facility requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2010.

The Company’s senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. The Company’s short-term debt is currently
rated P-2 by Moody’s and A-3 by Standard & Poor’s. The Company carries a stable outlook from Moody’s and a negative outlook from Standard & Poor’s.

The Company also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $272 million at
December 31, 2010 and $250 million at December 31, 2009. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2010.

Share Repurchases

On September 15, 2010, the
Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company repurchased 3.4 million of its common stock for total consideration of $85.5 million. The repurchase
authorization does not have a time limit.

Dividends

The Company paid total dividends of $452 million in 2010 ($0.81 per share), $431 million in 2009 ($0.80 per share) and $412 million ($0.80 per share) in 2008.

Investing Cash Flows

Net cash provided by investing
activities amounted to $535 million in 2010. This compares with $236 million of net cash used for investing activities in 2009. The Company made eight acquisitions in 2010. Cash used for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $427 million
compared with $67 million used for acquisitions in 2009. In addition, the Company issued approximately 7.6 million shares of common stock with an acquisition date value of $183 million, and recorded a liability of $81 million for estimated
contingent purchase consideration related to the acquisitions completed in 2010. In 2010, the Company also paid $60 million of deferred purchase consideration, $3 million for other intangible assets and $2 million of contingent purchase
consideration related to acquisitions made in prior years. Remaining deferred cash payments of $189 million for acquisitions completed in 2010 and in prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010. The Company paid contingent consideration of $6 million in 2009.

Cash provided by the sale of
securities was $32 million and $42 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company received $1.13 billion from its disposition of Kroll, which
closed on August 3, 2010 and $110 million from the disposition of KLS which closed in the second quarter of 2010. In 2009, the Company received $70 million related to the disposition of KGS.

The Company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $271 million in 2010 and $305 million in 2009, primarily relate to computer
equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. These amounts include additions related to Kroll, which is included in discontinued operations, of $13 million and $44 million for 2010 and
2009, respectively.



The Company has committed to potential future investments of approximately $81 million in connection with its
investments in Trident II and other funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC. The majority of the Company’s investment commitments for funds managed by Stone Point Capital, LLC are related to Trident II, the investment period for which is now
closed for new investments. No significant future capital calls related to Trident II are expected.

Commitments and Obligations

The following identifies the Company’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of December 31, 2010:

The above does not
include unrecognized tax benefits of $199 million as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $30 million that may become payable during 2010. The above does not include the
indemnified liabilities discussed in Note 16 as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities. The above does not include pension liabilities of $935 million because the timing and amount of ultimate
payment of such liability is dependent upon future events, including, but not limited to, future returns on plan assets, and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities. The amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made
from plan assets are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company expects to contribute approximately $20 million and $300 million in 2011 to its U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively.

Market Risk and Credit Risk

Certain of the Company’s
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.

Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk

The Company has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate
changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance the Company’s asset base. During 2007, virtually all of the Company’s variable rate borrowings were repaid. In January 2011, the Company entered into two 3.5
year interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of the first $250 million of its 5.375% senior notes due in 2014. Under the terms of the swap, the counterparties will pay the Company a fixed rate of 5.375% and the Company will pay
interest at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 3.726%. The swaps are designated as fair value hedging instruments and are deemed to be perfectly effective in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.

Interest income generated from the Company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates,
particularly short-term interest rates.

The Company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates:



These investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in Note1 to the consolidated financial statements
appearing in Item 8 of this report.

Based on the above balances, if short-term interest rates increased or decreased by 10%, or 13 basis points,
over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase or decrease by approximately $5 million.

In addition to interest rate risk, our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk. To
minimize this risk, the Company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a Board-approved investment policy. The policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based
primarily on credit rating and type of investment. The Company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions. The majority of cash and fiduciary funds are
invested in short-term bank deposits and liquid money market funds.

Foreign Currency Risk

The translated values of revenue and expense from the Company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates.
The non-U.S. based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 56% of total revenue. Note 17 details revenue by geographic area. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate
exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations, in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location. As such, the U.S. dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses, as well as the potentially offsetting
movements of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk. The Company estimates that a 10% movement of major foreign currencies (Euro, Sterling, Australian
dollar and Canadian dollar) in the same direction against the U.S. dollar that held constant over the course of the year would increase or decrease full year net operating income by approximately $50 million.

Equity Price Risk

The Company holds investments in public
and private companies, as well as in certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point Capital. Publicly traded investments of $23 million are classified as available for sale. Non-publicly traded investments of $39 million are accounted for using
the cost method and $168 million are accounted for using the equity method. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other
than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements.

Other

A number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are
pending. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to
make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the
Company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may
differ from those estimates.



Legal and Other Loss Contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions. GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable
that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company analyzes its litigation exposure based on available
information, including consultation with internal and external counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability.

In
addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company’s various insurance programs.

Retirement Benefits

The Company maintains qualified and
non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax
qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.

The Company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. The
gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax, in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets.

The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated
financial statements. The Company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Based on its current assumptions, the
Company expects pension expense in 2011 to increase approximately $60 million compared with 2010 before partly-offsetting impacts of bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates.

Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions and various other factors related to the
populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half-percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K.
plans, which together comprise approximately 87% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows:

Changing the
discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate.

The Company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these postretirement benefits for
employees in the U.S. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by the Company as incurred. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in
Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.



Income Taxes

The Company tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required
in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax
position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only
the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts
and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that
meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of
being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.

Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist
at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution
of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.

Tax law requires items be
included in the Company’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax
returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet
been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. In
assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance
accordingly. The Company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation
allowance. The Company also considers tax-planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the appropriate tax law. The
underlying assumptions the Company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the Company’s recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of
future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not future taxable
income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.

Fair Value Determinations

Investment Valuation—The Company holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain private equity funds. The majority of the public
investments are accounted for as available for sale securities. Certain investments, primarily investments in private equity funds, are accounted for using the equity method. Although not directly recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheets, the Company defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately $10 billion. The fair value of these investments determines, in part, the over-or under-funded status of those plans,



which is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are
appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. The Company bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. Fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment
managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public
companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In those instances where
quoted market prices are not available, particularly for equity holdings in private companies, or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of the Company’s
investments. The Company reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments.

Goodwill
Impairment Testing—The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the annual
impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on
balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities, as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. The Company performed interim goodwill impairment
assessments in its Risk Consulting & Technology segment which resulted in an impairment charge of $315 million recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and impairment charges totaling $540 million recorded in the first and second quarters of
2008. Impairment charges included in discontinued operations were $315 million and $504 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Risk Consulting & Technology segment was effectively disposed of with the sale of Kroll in August of 2010. The
Company completed its 2010 annual review in the third quarter of 2010 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. The fair value estimates used in this
assessment are dependent upon assumptions and estimates about the future profitability and other financial ratios of our reporting units, as well as relevant financial data, recent transactions and market valuations of comparable public companies.

Share-based Payment

The guidance for accounting
for share-based payments requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and
expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined
by the accounting guidance.

As of December 31, 2010, there was $23.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. The
weighted-average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 1.7 years. Also as of December 31, 2010, there was $206 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock, restricted stock
unit and deferred stock unit awards.

See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding guidance for accounting
for share-based payments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations:

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (the “Company”), a global professional services firm, is organized based on the different services that it offers. Under
this organizational structure, the Company’s two business segments are Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. As discussed below, on August 3, 2010 the Company completed the sale of Kroll, the Company’s former Risk
Consulting & Technology segment, to Altegrity, Inc. (“Altegrity”).

As discussed in Note 5, the Company disposed of several businesses
from 2008 through 2010, which are classified as discontinued operations in these financial statements.

The Risk and Insurance Services segment provides
risk management and insurance broking, reinsurance broking and insurance program management services for businesses, public entities, insurance companies, associations, professional services organizations, and private clients. The Company conducts
business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter.

In the first quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired Haake Companies, Inc., an insurance broking firm
in the Midwest region and Thomas Rutherfoord, Inc., an insurance broking firm in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. In the second quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired HSBC Insurance Brokers Ltd., an international provider of risk
intermediary and risk advisory services and the Bostonian Group Insurance Agency, Inc. and Bostonian Solutions, Inc. (collectively the “Bostonian Group”), a regional insurance brokerage in New England. In the fourth quarter of 2010 Marsh
acquired Trion, a U.S. private benefits specialist and SBS, a Georgia-based benefits brokerage and consulting firm. In January 2011, Marsh acquired RJF Agencies, an independent insurance agency in the upper Midwest.

In April 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of John B. Collins Associates, Inc., previously the fifth-largest reinsurance intermediary in the U.S. and
seventh-largest in the world. In October 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of London-based specialty reinsurance broker Rattner Mackenzie Limited from HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. In September 2009, Marsh acquired International Advisory
Services, Ltd., an independent manager of captives and third-party insurance companies in Bermuda. In December 2009, Marsh acquired the NIA Group, LLC, an independent insurance agency in the Northeast.

The Consulting segment provides advice and services to the managements of organizations in the area of human resource consulting, comprising retirement and
investments, health and benefits, outsourcing and talent; and strategy and risk management consulting, comprising management, economic and brand consulting. The Company conducts business in this segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. In July
2010, Mercer acquired Innovative Process Administration (“IPA”), a provider of health and benefit recordkeeping and employee enrollment technology. In August 2010, Mercer acquired ORC Worldwide, a premier provider of HR knowledge, data and
solutions for professionals in numerous industries. In the first quarter of 2011 Mercer acquired Hammond Associates, an investment consulting company for endowments and foundations in the U.S.

In the first quarter of 2010, Kroll completed the sale of KLS. On August 3, 2010, the Company completed the sale of Kroll to Altegrity for cash consideration of $1.13 billion. The account balances and
activities of Kroll and KLS were segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009. The gain on the sale of Kroll and related tax benefits and the after-tax loss on the sale
of KLS, along with Kroll’s and KLS’s 2010 comparative results of operations are included in discontinued operations in 2010.

In the fourth
quarter of 2008, the principal operations within the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring business (“CARG”) were divested. Additionally, two small residual corporate advisory and restructuring businesses were exited in the first quarter of
2009. Based on the terms and conditions of the divestures, the Company determined it has “continuing involvement” in the divested businesses, as that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. Therefore, classification of the
corporate



advisory and restructuring businesses as discontinued operations is not appropriate and their financial results in the current and prior periods are included in operating income.

With the sale of Kroll in August 2010, along with previous divestiture transactions between 2008 and 2010, the Company has now divested its entire Risk Consulting
& Technology segment. The run-off of the Company’s involvement in the CARG businesses is now managed by the Company’s corporate departments, and consequently, the financial results of these businesses are now included in
“Corporate” for segment reporting purposes.

Principles of Consolidation:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fiduciary
Assets and Liabilities:

In its capacity as an insurance broker or agent, the Company collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. The Company also
collects claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds.

Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by the Company in a fiduciary
capacity. The Company also collects claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds. Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes interest on fiduciary funds of $45 million in 2010, $54 million in 2009 and $139 million in 2008. The
Consulting segment recorded fiduciary interest income of $4 million in 2010 and 2009 and $10 million in 2008. Since fiduciary assets are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities.

Fiduciary assets include approximately $283 million and $577 million of fixed income securities classified as available for sale at December 31,
2010 and 2009, respectively. Unrealized gains or losses from available for sale securities are recorded in other comprehensive income until the securities are disposed of, or mature. Unrealized gains, net of tax, on these securities were $5 million
and $12 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables were $9.1 billion and
$9.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company is not a principal to the contracts under which the right to receive premiums or the right to receive reimbursement of insured losses arises. Net uncollected premiums and
claims and the related payables are, therefore, not assets and liabilities of the Company and are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. These advances are made from corporate funds and are reflected in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets as receivables.

Revenue:

Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for
services rendered and interest income on certain fiduciary funds. Insurance commissions and fees for risk transfer services generally are recorded as of the effective date of the applicable policies or, in certain cases (primarily in the Company
reinsurance operations), as of the effective date or billing date, whichever is later. Commissions are net of policy cancellation reserves, which are estimated based on historic and current data on cancellations. Fees for non-risk transfer services
provided to clients are recognized over the period in which the services are provided, using a proportional performance model. Fees resulting from achievement of certain performance thresholds are recorded when such levels are attained and such fees
are not subject to forfeiture.

As part of the sale of MMC Capital in 2005, the Company retained the right to receive certain performance fees related to
the Trident II and Trident III private equity partnerships. The Company has deferred the recognition of such performance fee revenue of $84 million at December 31, 2010. This revenue is based on the investment performance over the life of each
private equity fund, and future declines in fund performance from current levels may result in the forfeiture of such revenue. The Company recognizes performance fee revenue when such fees are no longer subject to forfeiture, which for the $84
million noted above, may take a number of years to resolve.



Consulting revenue includes fees paid by clients for advice and services and commissions from insurance companies for
the placement of individual and group contracts. Fee revenue for engagements where remuneration is based on time plus out-of-pocket expenses is recognized based on the amount of time consulting professionals expend on the engagement. For fixed fee
engagements, revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model. Revenue from insurance commissions not subject to a fee arrangement is recorded over the effective period of the applicable policies. Revenues for asset based fees are
recognized on an accrual basis by applying the daily/monthly rate as contractually agreed with the client to the net asset value. On a limited number of engagements, performance fees may also be earned for achieving certain pre-determined
performance criteria. Such fees are recognized when the performance criteria have been achieved and agreed to by the client. Expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue are billed to the client and included in revenue.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of certificates of deposit and time deposits, with original
maturities of three months or less, and money market funds.

Fixed Assets:

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

Depreciation of buildings, building improvements, furniture, and
equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods covered by the applicable leases or the estimated useful life of the
improvement, whichever is less. The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable.

The components of fixed assets are as follows:

Investment
Securities:

The Company holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain private equity funds. Publicly traded investments are classified as available for sale and carried at market value. Non-publicly traded
investments are carried at cost. Changes in the fair value of available for sale securities are recorded in stockholders’ equity, net of applicable taxes, until realized. Securities classified as available for sale or carried at cost are
considered long-term investments and are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Certain investments, primarily investments in
private equity funds, are accounted for under the equity method using a consistently applied three-month lag period adjusted for any significant changes from the lag period to the reporting date of the Company. The underlying private equity funds
follow investment company accounting, where securities within the fund are carried at net asset value. The Company records its proportionate share of the change in fair value of the funds in earnings which amounted to gains/(losses) of $32 million,
$(6) million and $(11) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Securities recorded using the equity method are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Gains, net of incentive compensation, or losses recognized in earnings from the investment securities described above are included in investment income (loss) in the consolidated statements of income. Costs related
to management of the Company’s investments, including incentive compensation partially derived from investment income and (loss), are recorded in operating expenses.



Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:

Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair
value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. The Company performs an annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. Fair values of the reporting units are
estimated using either a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those
assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. Other intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their estimated lives and reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering
events in accordance with applicable accounting literature. The Company had no indefinite lived identified intangible assets at December 31, 2010 or 2009.

Capitalized Software Costs:

The Company capitalizes certain costs to develop, purchase or modify software for the internal use of the Company. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis
over periods ranging from three to ten years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to
updates and enhancements are only capitalized if they will result in additional functionality. Capitalized computer software costs of $215 million and $214 million, net of accumulated amortization of $572 million and $505 million at
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Legal and Other Loss
Contingencies:

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings. The Company records liabilities for contingencies including legal costs when it is probable that a liability has
been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. To the extent such losses can be recovered under the Company’s insurance programs, estimated recoveries are recorded when losses for insured events are
recognized and the recoveries are probable of realization. Significant management judgment is required to estimate the amounts of such contingent liabilities and the related insurance recoveries. The Company analyzes its litigation exposure based on
available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. Contingent liabilities are not discounted.

Income Taxes:

The Company’s tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in
determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions and company ability to realize deferred tax assets.

The Company reports a
liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether
it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from
both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than
not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of
benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.

Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new
information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an
issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Tax law requires items be
included in the Company’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax
returns. Some of these differences are



permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred
tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are
established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial
statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements.

Derivative Instruments:

All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If
the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value attributable to the ineffective
portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

Concentrations of Credit Risk:

Financial instruments which potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, commissions and fees receivable and insurance recoverables. The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent
investments and places its investments in a large number of high quality financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the large number of
clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas.

Per Share
Data:

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the guidance for the calculation of earnings per share (“EPS”) for share-based payment awards with rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. The guidance indicates
that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and should be included in the computation of basic and dilutive EPS using the
two-class method. The adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on the fiscal year 2008 for EPS from continuing operations, discontinued operations and net income because the treasury stock method was more dilutive.

Basic net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income
attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.

Diluted net income attributable
to the Company per share and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company’s common
stock, which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares (excluding those that are considered participating securities). The diluted earnings per share calculation reflects the more dilutive effect of either
(a) the two-class method that assumes that the participating securities have not been exercised or (b) the treasury stock method. Reconciliation of the applicable income components used for diluted earnings per share and basic weighted
average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding is presented below. The following information represents the Company’s current presentation:



(1)

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, earnings per share was more dilutive under the treasury stock method. Therefore, no amounts are allocated to participating
securities for that period.

There were 43.4 million, 46.4 million and 50.7 million stock options outstanding as of
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There were 1 million common stock equivalents in 2008 that would have increased diluted weighted average common shares outstanding; however, they have not been included in the calculation
since the Company reported a net loss.

Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may vary from those estimates.

New Accounting
Pronouncements:

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the new guidance issued by the FASB for Business Combinations. The guidance requires entities in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose all information needed by investors
and other users to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. The



Company made several acquisitions in 2010 and 2009 that were accounted for under the new Business Combination guidance, which are discussed in more detail in Note 4.

In December 2010, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance for pro-forma disclosures arising from business combinations. The amendments specify that if a public
entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable
prior annual reporting period only. The amendments also expand the supplemental pro-forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro-forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination
included in the reported pro-forma revenue and earnings. The amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after
December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s future disclosures.

On April 1, 2009, the FASB issued guidance for “Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies” to address application issues raised by
preparers, auditors and attorneys. The guidance requires recognition of contingent assets or liabilities (arising from a business combination contingency) at fair value, at the acquisition date if the acquisition-date fair value of the asset or
liability can be determined during the measurement period; or if the following criteria are met:

(a)

Information available before the end of the measurement period indicates that it is probable that an asset existed or that a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date
and

(b)

The amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated.

Otherwise, the acquirer should not recognize an asset or liability as of the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for business combinations occurring on or
after January 1, 2009. This new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or reported results.

In the second
quarter of 2009, the Company adopted the guidance issued by the FASB for Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments. It amends GAAP guidance including SEC SAB Topic 5M and other authoritative literature that allow the holders
of debt securities not to recognize other-than-temporary impairments based on their intent and ability to hold a security until recovery in fair value to its amortized cost. The other-than-temporary impairment model applies only to debt securities
and not equity securities. The new requirements are (a) whether an entity has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) whether an entity will more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery.
The guidance requires recognition of a credit loss (the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis) through earnings. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after
June 15, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or reported results.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the guidance for calculating EPS using the two-class method with retroactive application to prior periods. The
impact of adopting the guidance is discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

In December 2009, the FASB issued new guidance related
to the Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (“VIE”). The new guidance focuses on “controlling financial interests” and requires companies to perform qualitative analysis to determine whether they must consolidate a VIE by
assessing whether the variable interests give them controlling financial interests in the VIE. This guidance is effective for transfers occurring on or after November 15, 2009. Provisions must be applied in annual reporting periods beginning
after November 15, 2009 and interim periods within that annual period. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

Also, effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted new guidance that indefinitely defers the above changes relating to the Company’s interests in entities that have all the attributes of an investment
company or for which it is industry practice to apply measurement principles for financial reporting that



are consistent with those applied by an investment company. Mercer manages approximately $12 billion of assets in trusts or funds for which Mercer’s management or trustee fee is
considered a variable interest. Mercer has no net investment in any of these funds, and its maximum exposure to loss is limited to collection of its fees. As a result, the above guidance did not apply to certain investment management trusts managed
by Mercer.

In January 2010, the FASB issued new guidance that adds additional disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 items and
separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to Level 3 measurements. It also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure
fair value. Further, the new guidance amends the requirements on employer’s disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets to require disclosures be provided by classes of assets instead of by major categories of assets. This guidance is
effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 31, 2009, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB amended its guidance on revenue recognition regarding multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. The guidance is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into or materially
modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance.

On April 29,
2010, the FASB issued guidance which establishes a revenue recognition model for contingent consideration that is payable upon the achievement of an uncertain future event, referred to as a milestone. The scope of this guidance is limited to
research or development arrangements and requires an entity to record the milestone payment in its entirety in the period received if the milestone meets all the necessary criteria to be considered substantive. However, entities would not be
precluded from making an accounting policy election to apply another appropriate accounting policy that results in the deferral of some portion of the arrangement consideration. This is effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those
fiscal years) beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early application is permitted. Entities can apply this guidance prospectively to milestones achieved after adoption. However, retrospective application to all prior periods is also permitted.
The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance.

In May 2010, the FASB issued guidance for foreign currency issues and
Venezuela’s highly inflationary status. The guidance states that Venezuela’s economy should be considered highly inflationary as of January 1, 2010 and therefore a U.S. dollar reporting entity must remeasure the financial statements
of its Venezuelan subsidiaries as if the subsidiaries’ functional reporting currency were the entity’s reporting currency (i.e., the U.S. dollar). Any differences between the U.S. dollar denominated balances recorded by the Venezuelan
subsidiaries and the amounts reported in the entity’s consolidated financial statements must be recognized in earnings or as part of its cumulative translation adjustment. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

In December 2010, the FASB issued guidance to clarify when to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for
reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. This guidance is not currently applicable to the Company, since all reporting units have positive carrying amounts.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform with current year presentation, in particular with regard to separate disclosure of income taxes
receivable on the consolidated balance sheets.



2.    Supplemental Disclosures

The following schedule provides additional information concerning acquisitions, interest and income taxes paid:

The Company had
non-cash issuances of common stock under its share-based payment plan of $182 million, $123 million and $103 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recorded stock based compensation expense related to equity
awards of $174 million, $193 million, and $76 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The consolidated cash
flow statements include the cash flow impact of discontinued operations in each cash flow category. The cash flow impact of discontinued operations from the operating, financing and investing cash flow categories is as follows:

The information above
excludes the cash flow impacts of actual disposal transactions related to discontinued operations because the Company believes these transactions to be cash flows attributable to the parent company, arising from its decision to dispose of the
discontinued operation. The Company’s cash flow reflects the cash provided by investing activities in 2010 of $1.13 billion from the disposal of Kroll and $110 million for the disposition of KLS, $75 million primarily from the disposal of Kroll
Government Services (“KGS”) in 2009 and $56 million from the disposal of Mediservice and Kroll Crucible in 2008.

An analysis of the allowance
for doubtful accounts is as follows:

4.    Acquisitions

The Company made six acquisitions in its Risk and Insurance Services segment and two acquisitions in its Consulting segment in 2010.

In the first quarter of 2010, Marsh acquired Haake Companies, Inc., an independent insurance broking firm in the Midwest, and Thomas Rutherfoord, Inc., an insurance broking firm in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic
regions in the U.S. In the second quarter of 2010, Marsh completed the acquisition of HSBC Insurance Brokers Ltd. (“HIBL”). This transaction deepens Marsh’s presence in the U.K., Hong Kong, Singapore, China and the Middle East. As
part of the acquisition agreement, Marsh also entered into a strategic partnership with HSBC Bank that gives the Company preferred access to provide insurance broking and risk management services to HSBC and their corporate and private clients. Also
in the second quarter, Marsh & McLennan Agency acquired the Bostonian Group, a regional insurance brokerage in New England. In the fourth quarter of 2010 Marsh acquired Strategic Benefits Solutions, Inc., a benefits brokerage and consulting
firm located in the Southeast region of the U.S., and Trion Group, Inc., a provider of brokerage and administrative services. Each of these acquisitions, except HIBL, were made to expand Marsh’s share in the middle-market through
Marsh & McLennan Agency.

In July 2010, Mercer acquired IPA, a provider of health and benefit recordkeeping and employee enrollment technology.
In August 2010, Mercer acquired ORC Worldwide, a premier provider of HR knowledge, data and solutions for professionals in numerous industries.

Total
purchase consideration for the eight acquisitions made during 2010 was $754 million which consisted of cash paid of $490 million, the issuance of 7.6 million shares with a fair value of $183



million and estimated contingent consideration of $81 million. Contingent consideration arrangements are primarily based on EBITDA and revenue targets over two to four years. The fair values of
the contingent consideration were based on earnings projections of the acquired entities and are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to adjustment when
purchase accounting is finalized.

In 2010, the Company also paid $60 million of deferred purchase consideration, $3 million for the purchase of other
intangible assets and $2 million of contingent purchase consideration related to acquisitions made in prior years.

During 2009, the Company made six
acquisitions in its Risk and Insurance Services segment.

In April 2009, Guy Carpenter completed the acquisition of John B. Collins Associates, Inc.,
previously the fifth-largest reinsurance intermediary in the U.S. and seventh-largest in the world. The acquisition of Collins further strengthens Guy Carpenter’s capabilities in medical professional liability, agriculture, Florida property,
Program and regional specialty lines of business.

In July 2009, Marsh acquired RJ Neville and Associates, a boutique insurance and risk management firm
based in Brisbane. The acquisition, which is part of a broader growth strategy, will build the firm’s book of business in the Brisbane area.

In
September 2009, Marsh completed the acquisition of International Advisory Services Ltd. (IAS), an independent manager of captive and third-party insurance companies in Bermuda. The acquisition strengthens Marsh’s position as a global leader in
managing captive insurance companies and its rank as Bermuda’s largest captive management organization.

In October 2009, Guy Carpenter acquired
Rattner Mackenzie Limited, a reinsurance broker based in London. The acquisition was made in line with Guy Carpenter’s strategic growth approach whereby organic expansion is augmented by acquisitions.

In November 2009, Marsh acquired Insurance Alliance, an independent insurance agency in Texas. In December 2009, Marsh acquired The NIA Group,
LLC, an independent insurance agency in the Northeast. These transactions marked the beginning of planned strategic acquisitions as Marsh & McLennan Agency builds a national business to serve the needs of small to mid-sized companies across
the United States.

Total purchase consideration for the 2009 acquisitions was $414 million which consisted of cash paid of $85 million, the issuance of
10.7 million shares amounting to $229 million and future payouts of $100 million.

In the first quarter of 2009, the Company acquired the remaining
minority interest of a previously majority owned entity for total purchase consideration of $47 million. The Company accounted for this acquisition under the guidance for consolidations and non-controlling interests that became effective in 2009.
This guidance requires that changes in a parent’s ownership interest while retaining financial controlling interest in a subsidiary be accounted for as an equity transaction. Stepping up the acquired assets to fair value or the recording of
goodwill is not permitted. Therefore, the Company recorded a decrease to additional paid-in capital in 2009 of $38 million related to this transaction.



The following table presents the preliminary allocation of the acquisition costs for the companies acquired by the
Company during 2010 to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their fair values.

In the first
quarter of 2010, the Company paid deferred purchase consideration of $15 million related to the purchase in 2009 of the minority interest of a previously controlled entity, discussed above.

Pending Acquisitions

In January 2011, Marsh announced that it had acquired RJF Agencies, a provider of
property and casualty insurance and employee benefits to middle market companies in the Midwest region. Also in January 2011, Mercer announced that it had completed the acquisition of Hammond Associates, the third largest investment consulting
company for endowments and foundations in the U.S.

Pro-Forma Information

The following unaudited pro-forma financial data gives effect to the acquisitions made by the Company during 2009, 2010 and 2011, as if they occurred on January 1, 2009. The pro-forma information adjusts for
the effects of amortization of acquired intangibles. The pro-forma information also reflects the classification of Kroll’s operating results in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The unaudited pro-forma financial data is
presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been achieved if such acquisitions had occurred on the dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of future consolidated
results.



5.    Discontinued Operations

On August 3, 2010, the Company completed the sale of Kroll to Altegrity for cash proceeds of $1.13 billion. Kroll’s assets and liabilities are reported in discontinued operations at December 31,
2009. The pre-tax gain of $25 million, the tax benefit related to the disposal, Kroll’s results through August 3, 2010, and Kroll’s operating results in 2009 and 2008 are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income.

The Company’s tax basis in its investment in the stock of Kroll exceeded the recorded amount primarily as a
result of prior impairments of goodwill recognized for financial reporting, but not for tax. Prior to the second quarter of 2010, a tax benefit had not been recorded for this temporary difference because it was not apparent in the foreseeable future
that it would reverse in a transaction that would result in a tax benefit. Since Kroll met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in the second quarter of 2010, the Company determined that it had the ability to carry back the
capital loss realized against prior realized capital gains. Therefore, a $277 million tax benefit was recorded in discontinued operations in 2010. The sale of Kroll resulted in the current realization of a portion of this tax benefit. The benefit
has been recovered in part through offset of capital gains arising in 2010, and the remainder of the loss to be carried back has been established as a current tax receivable, which is expected to be recovered in the second quarter of 2011.

In the first quarter of 2010, Kroll completed the sale of KLS. The after-tax loss
on this disposal is included in discontinued operations in 2010. The operating results of KLS are included in discontinued operations.

Discontinued
operations in 2010 and 2009 includes the accretion of interest related to an indemnity for uncertain tax positions provided as part of the purchase by Great-West Lifeco Inc. of Putnam Investments Trust from the Company in August 2007. Discontinued
operations in 2010 also include $16 million for insurance recoveries related to Putnam market-timing.

In the second quarter of 2009 Kroll completed the
sale of Kroll Government Services (“KGS”). The operating results of KGS are included in discontinued operations in 2009 and 2008.

In 2008,
discontinued operations also includes Putnam, Mediservice and Kroll Crucible which are discussed in more detail below.

With regard to Putnam,
discontinued operations in 2008 includes (1) the impact of immaterial corrections and other adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2007 tax provision related to the transaction, (2) adjustments to the tax provision to reflect differences
between tax returns filed in 2008 and the initial estimated provisions, and (3) interest on liabilities for certain tax-related indemnities provided as part of the transaction. In the first quarter of 2008, Marsh completed the sale of
Mediservice, a claims administration operation in Brazil. The gain on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, Kroll completed the sale of Kroll Crucible (“Crucible”), a
division of its government services operation. The loss on this disposal, net of tax, is included in discontinued operations in 2008.

As part of the
disposal of Putnam, the Company provided indemnities to GWL with respect to certain Putnam-related litigation and regulatory matters described in Note 16, and certain indemnities related to contingent tax liabilities (the “indemnified
matters”). The Company estimated the “fair value” of the indemnities based on a (i) probability weighted assessment of possible outcomes; or (ii) in circumstances where the probability or amounts of potential outcomes could
not be determined, an analysis of similar but not identical circumstances prepared by a company-affiliated professional economic valuation firm. The amounts recognized are the greater of the estimated fair value of the indemnity or the amount
required to be recorded per the guidelines for accounting for contingencies or the accounting for income taxes (for tax-related matters). The remaining liability related to these indemnities was approximately $195 million at December 31, 2010.
This liability considers the potential settlement amount as well as related defense costs. The matters for which indemnities have been provided are inherently uncertain as to their eventual outcome. The process of estimating “fair value”
entails necessarily uncertain assumptions about such future outcomes. Consequently, the ultimate resolution of the matters for which indemnities have been provided may well vary significantly from the calculated liabilities.



The indemnities described above do not have a stated expiration date. The Company is released from risk under the
indemnity as the indemnified matters are settled or otherwise resolved. Since the Company is not released from risk under the indemnities simply based on the passage of time, future costs of settlements and/or legal fees related to the indemnified
matters will be charged against the liability so long as they are consistent with the estimated exposure contemplated for such matters when the liability was established. The Company assesses the status of the indemnified matters each reporting
period to determine whether to cease reduction of the liability, and/or whether additional accruals are appropriate for non-tax related matters or for tax related matters. Any future charges or credits resulting from the settlement or resolution of
the indemnified matters, or any adjustments to the liabilities related to such matters will be recorded in discontinued operations.

Kroll, KLS, KGS and
Kroll Crucible were part of the Company’s Risk Consulting & Technology segment. The Company has now divested its entire Risk Consulting & Technology segment.

Summarized Statements of Income data for discontinued operations is as follows:

(a)

Includes goodwill impairment charge of $315 million and $504 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

(b)

Includes gain on sale of Kroll and the gain on the sale of KLS in 2010 and a loss on the sale of Kroll Government Services in 2009.

(c)

Includes the provision /(credit) for income taxes relating to the recognition of tax benefits recorded in connection with the sale of Kroll as well as a tax provision of $36
million on the sale of KLS in 2010.

The assets and liabilities of Kroll and KLS are classified as current assets, non-current assets and
current liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009. The assets of Kroll primarily consist of goodwill, other identified intangible assets, commissions and fees receivable and fixed assets.

6.    Goodwill and Other Intangibles

The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs the
annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. This fair value determination was
categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and
liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. The Company completed its 2010 annual review in the third quarter of 2010 and concluded goodwill was not impaired.



The Company completed the sale of Kroll on August 3, 2010. Goodwill related to Kroll has been reflected as assets
of discontinued operations at December 31, 2009.

As previously reported, in the second quarter of 2009, Kroll completed the sale of KGS, its U.S.
government security clearance screening business. As a result of the sale, the Company allocated goodwill between KGS (the portion of the reporting unit sold) and Kroll (the portion of the reporting unit retained), based on the relative fair value
of the two units. In addition, as required under GAAP, the Company evaluated the portion of the reporting unit retained for potential impairment. Fair value was estimated using a market approach, based on management’s latest projections and
outlook for the businesses in the current environment. This fair value determination was categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. On the basis of the step one impairment test, the Company concluded that goodwill in the reporting unit was
impaired. A step two impairment test which under ASC Topic No. 350 (“Intangibles – Goodwill and Other”) is required to be completed after an impairment is indicated in a step one test and requires a complete re-valuation of all
assets and liabilities of the reporting units in the same manner as a business combination. The Company recorded a non-cash charge of $315 million to write down Kroll’s goodwill to its estimated fair value in 2009. The charge of $315 million is
included in discontinued operations, which also includes the operating results of Kroll.

In March 2008, the Company announced a management
reorganization within the Risk Consulting & Technology segment, whereby two separate units were formed, each reporting directly to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. These units are: (i) Kroll, which includes litigation
support and data recovery, background screening, and risk mitigation and response; and (ii) Corporate Advisory and Restructuring. As a result of the management reorganization, the Company conducted an interim goodwill assessment for the new
reporting units within the Risk Consulting & Technology segment in the first quarter of 2008. Fair value was estimated using a market approach, based on management’s latest projections and outlook for the businesses in the current
environment at that time. In particular, events impacting the mortgage markets negatively impacted Kroll Factual Data, and the environment for Corporate Advisory and Restructuring was difficult. On the basis of the step one impairment test, the
Company concluded that goodwill in the segment was impaired, and recorded a charge of $425 million in the first quarter of 2008 to reflect the estimated amount of the impairment. Due to the timing of the trigger event and subsequent completion of
the step one test, the Company was unable to complete the required step two portion of the impairment assessment prior to the issuance of its first quarter 2008 financial statements. The Company recorded an additional impairment charge of $115
million in the second quarter of 2008. The Company included $504 million of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2008 in discontinued operations.

Other intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their estimated lives and reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of
certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature.

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:

(a)

Amounts in 2010 exclude goodwill and accumulated impairment losses related to Kroll, which were reclassified to discontinued operations.

(b)

Primarily foreign exchange.



The goodwill acquired of $502 million in 2010 represents $468 million related to the Risk and Insurance Services
segment and $34 million related to the Consulting segment.

Goodwill related to Kroll of approximately $800 million at December 31, 2009 is included
in non-current assets of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets.

Goodwill allocable to the Company’s reportable segments is as
follows: Risk and Insurance Services $4.4 billion and Consulting $2.0 billion.

Amortized intangible assets consist of the cost of client lists, client
relationships and trade names acquired. The gross cost and accumulated amortization is as follows:

Aggregate
amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $50 million, $26 million and $36 million, respectively, and the estimated future aggregate amortization expense is as follows:

7.    Income Taxes

Income before income taxes shown below is based on the geographic location to which such income is attributable. Although income taxes related to such income may be assessed in more than one jurisdiction, the
income tax provision corresponds to the geographic location of the income.



The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classifications are
as follows:

(a)

Net of valuation allowances of $3 million and $2 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

(b)

Net of valuation allowances of $47 million and $52 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

U.S. Federal
income taxes are not provided on temporary differences with respect to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration, which at December 31, 2010 amounted to approximately $3.6 billion. The determination of the
unrecognized deferred tax liability with respect to these investments is not practicable.

A reconciliation from the U.S. Federal statutory income tax
rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate is shown below.

The Company’s
consolidated tax rate in 2010 was 26.5%. The tax rate reflects foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate.

The
Company’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2009 was 3.8%. The tax rate reflects reductions relating to a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The
decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from expiring statutes of limitations, audit settlements, and changes in estimates.

The
Company’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2008 was 22.9%. The tax rate reflects foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate. It also reflects a federal benefit on deferred state taxes, largely offset by other deferred tax
adjustments.



Valuation allowances had a net increase of $4 million in 2010 and $26 million in 2009. During the respective years,
adjustments of the beginning of the year balances of valuation allowances decreased income tax expense by $1 million in 2010 and increased income tax expense by $9 million in 2009. None of the cumulative valuation allowances relate to amounts which
if realized would increase contributed capital in the future. Approximately 81% of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2011 through 2030, and others are unlimited. The potential tax benefit from net operating loss
carryforwards at the end of 2010 comprised U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. tax benefits of $55 million, $95 million and $87 million, respectively, before reduction for valuation allowances. Foreign tax credit carryforwards expire in 2018
and 2020.

The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits
are deductible or creditable. The Company and Marsh have been profitable globally. However, tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis. Certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or
consolidated tax filings.

In the United States, certain groups within the Company, which file on a combined basis, and certain entities within
Marsh’s operations, which file on a separate entity basis, incurred losses for the last two years as well as the current year. The Company assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets, particularly state deferred tax assets of
Marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns, state deferred tax assets of all of the Company’s domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the Company files a unitary or combined state tax return, and
foreign tax credit carryforwards in the Company’s consolidated U.S. federal tax return. When making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010, the Company considered all available
evidence, placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified. The evidence considered included (i) the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, (ii) actions completed that
are designed to reduce capacity and adjust to lower demand in the current economic environment, (iii) profit trends evidenced by recent improvements in the Company’s and Marsh’s operating performance, (iv) the nonrecurring nature
of some of the items that contributed to the cumulative losses, (v) the carryforward periods for the NOLs and foreign tax credit carryforwards, (vi) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving weight to sources according to the
extent to which they can be objectively verified, and (vii) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate utilization of NOLs. Based on its assessment, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that
a substantial portion of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. In the event sufficient
taxable income is not generated in future periods, additional valuation allowances of up to $250 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets. The realization of the remaining U.S. federal deferred tax assets is not as
sensitive to U.S. profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future earnings from the Company’s profitable global operations. In addition, when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets
at December 31, 2010, the Company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses, including other U.S. entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign
subsidiaries, and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate.

Following is a reconciliation of the Company’s total gross unrecognized tax
benefits for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:



Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010 and 2009, $123 million and $128 million,
respectively, represent the amount that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in any future periods. The total gross amount of accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2010 and 2009, before any applicable federal
benefit, was $35 million and $32 million, respectively.

As discussed in Note 5, the Company has provided certain indemnities related to contingent tax
liabilities as part of the disposals of Putnam and Kroll. At December 31, 2010, December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, $75 million, $80 million and $85 million, respectively, included in the chart above, relates to Putnam and
Kroll positions included in consolidated Company tax returns. Since the Company remains primarily liable to the taxing authorities for resolution of uncertain tax positions related to consolidated returns, these balances will remain as part of the
Company’s consolidated liability for uncertain tax positions. Any future charges or credits that are directly related to the disposal of Putnam and Kroll and the indemnified contingent tax issues, including interest accrued, will be recorded in
discontinued operations as incurred. The balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2010 in the chart above includes balances related to stand alone tax filings of Kroll that were reclassified and are included as part of the fair
value liability for contingent tax indemnities following the sale transaction.

The Company is routinely examined by the jurisdictions in which it has
significant operations. The Internal Revenue Service completed its examination of 2003 through 2005 during the fourth quarter of 2008 and is currently examining 2006 through 2008. New York State has examinations underway for various entities
covering the years 2003 through 2008. California completed its examination of years 2003 through 2005 and years 1999 through 2005 are in various stages of appeal. Massachusetts is examining years 2006 through 2007 for various entities. The United
Kingdom is examining tax years 2008 through 2009 for various subsidiaries. Examinations are underway in Canada (2005 to 2008) and Germany (2004 to 2008). Earlier years are closed in all of the foregoing jurisdictions. The Company regularly considers
the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from examinations. The Company has established appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions in relation to the potential assessments. The Company believes the
resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Company’s net income or cash flows and on its effective tax rate in a
particular future period. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease between zero and approximately $90 million within the next twelve months due to settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of
limitation.

8.    Retirement Benefits

The Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible
non-U.S. employees. The Company’s policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws.

Combined U.S. and non-U.S. Plans

The weighted average
actuarial assumptions utilized for the U.S. and significant non-U.S. defined benefit plans as of the end of the year are as follows:



The Company uses actuaries from Mercer, a subsidiary of the Company, to perform valuations of its
pension plans. The long-term rate of return assumption is selected for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets. The Company utilizes a model
developed by the Mercer actuaries to assist in the setting of this assumption. The model takes into account several factors, including: actual and target portfolio allocation; investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the
plan trust; historical portfolio performance; relevant forward-looking economic analysis; and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. These measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical
techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio. The Company generally does not adjust the rate of return assumption from year to year if, at the measurement date, it is within the best estimate range, defined as between the

th

and 75

th

percentile of the expected long-term annual returns in accordance with the “American Academy of Actuaries Pension Practice
Council Note May 2001 Selecting and Documenting Investment Return Assumptions” and consistent with Actuarial Standards of Practice No. 27. The historical five- and ten-year average asset returns of each plan are also reviewed to determine
whether they are consistent and reasonable compared with the best estimate range. The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the assumed long-term rate of return to the market-related value of plan assets. This market-related value
recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the
actual return based on the market value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future market-related value of the assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are
recorded.

The target asset allocation for the U.S. and U.K. plans is 58% equities and 42% fixed income. The U.K. plans comprise approximately 82% of
non-U.S. plan assets. As of the measurement date, the actual allocation of assets for the U.S. plan was 63% to equities and 37% to fixed income, and for the U.K. plans was 58% to equities and 42% to fixed income. The assets of the Company’s
defined benefit plans are well-diversified and are managed in accordance with applicable laws and with the goal of maximizing the plans’ real return within acceptable risk parameters. The Company uses threshold-based portfolio rebalancing to
ensure the actual portfolio remains consistent with target asset allocation ranges. The actual asset allocation of the U.S. and U.K. plans as of the measurement date were within the target range.

The U.S. qualified plan holds eight million shares of the Company’s common stock which were contributed to the Plan by the Company. This represents
approximately 6% of that plan’s assets.

The discount rate selected for each U.S. plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and
redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are based on appropriate bond indices such as the Markit iBoxx £ Corporates AA 15+ index in the U.K. Projected compensation
increases reflect current expectations as to future levels of inflation.

The components of the net periodic benefit cost for combined U.S. and non-U.S.
defined benefit plans and other postretirement plans are as follows:



Plan Assets

For the U.S. plan, investment allocation decisions are made by a fiduciary committee composed of senior executives appointed by the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer. For the non-U.S. plans, investment allocation decisions are made by local fiduciaries, in consultation with the Company for the larger plans. Plan assets are invested in a manner consistent with the fiduciary standards set forth in all
relevant laws relating to pensions and trusts in each country. Our primary investment objectives are (1) to achieve an investment return that, in combination with current and future contributions, will provide sufficient funds to pay benefits,
and (2) to minimize the risk of large losses. Our investment allocations are designed to meet these objectives by broadly diversifying plan assets among numerous asset classes with differing expected returns, volatilities, and correlations.

The major categories of plan assets include equity securities, equity alternative investments, and fixed income securities. For the U.S. qualified plan,
the category ranges are 53-63% for equities and equity alternatives, and 37-47% for fixed income. For the U.K. Plan, the category ranges are 55-61% for equities and equity alternatives, and 39-45% for fixed income. Asset allocation ranges are
evaluated generally every three years. Asset allocation is monitored monthly, and rebalancing actions are taken as needed.

Plan investments are exposed
to stock market, interest rate, and credit risk. Concentrations of these risks are generally limited due to diversification by investment style within each asset class, diversification by investment manager, diversification by industry sectors and
issuers, and the dispersion of investments across many geographic areas.



U.S. Plans

The
following schedules provide information concerning the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans:



Estimated amounts
that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income in the next fiscal year:

The weighted
average actuarial assumptions utilized in determining the above amounts for the U.S. defined benefit and other U.S. postretirement plans as of the end of the year are as follows:

The projected
benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $4.0 billion, $3.9 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, as of
December 31, 2010 and $3.6 billion, $3.5 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2009.

The projected benefit obligation and
fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets was $4.0 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2010 and $3.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, as of
December 31, 2009.



The components of the net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans
are as follows:

In December 2003,
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 became law. The net periodic benefit cost shown above for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, includes the subsidy.

The assumed health care cost trend rate for Medicare eligibles is approximately 8.4% in 2010, gradually declining to 4.5% in 2028, and the rate for non-Medicare eligibles is 8.2% in 2010, gradually declining to
4.5% in 2028. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a small effect on the amounts reported for the U.S. health care plans because the Company caps its share of health care trend at 5%. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost
trend rates would have the following effects:

Estimated Future
Contributions

The Company expects to fund approximately $20 million for its U.S. non-qualified plan in 2011. The Company’s policy for funding
its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign law. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified
plan for 2011.



Non-U.S. Plans

The following schedules provide information concerning the Company’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and non-U.S. postretirement benefit plans.



Estimated amounts that
will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income in the next fiscal year:



The weighted average actuarial assumption utilized in determining the above amounts for the non-U.S. defined benefit
and other non-U.S. postretirement plans as of the end of the year are as follows:

The non-U.S.
defined benefit plans do not have any direct ownership of the Company’s common stock.

The pension plan in the United Kingdom holds a limited
partnership interest in the Trident III private equity fund valued at $203 million at December 31, 2010.

The projected benefit obligation,
accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2010
and $0.5 billion, $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2009.

The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan
assets for non-U.S. pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2010 and $5.2 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31,
2009.

The components of the net periodic benefit cost for the non-U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans and the curtailment,
settlement and termination expenses are as follows:

The assumed health
care cost trend rate was approximately 6.8% in 2010, gradually declining to 4.5% in 2019. Assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the non-U.S. health care plans. A one percentage point change in
assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:



Estimated Future Contributions

The Company expects to fund approximately $300 million to its non-U.S. pension plans in 2011. Funding requirements for non-U.S. plans vary by country. Contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based
on local funding practices and requirements. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the
future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of the Company’s cash flows, including dividends, investments and share repurchases.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The Plan’s estimated future benefit payments for its pension and
postretirement benefits (without reduction for Medicare subsidy receipts) at December 31, 2010 are as follows:

Defined
Benefit Plans Fair Value Disclosures

In December 2008 the FASB issued guidance for Employers’ Disclosures About Pension and Other Post
Retirement Benefit Plan Assets. The guidance requires fair value plan asset disclosures for an employer’s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans similar to the guidance on Fair Value Measurements as well as (a) how investment
allocation decisions are made, (b) the major categories of plan assets, and (c) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.

The
U.S. and non-U.S. plan investments are classified into Level 1, which refers to securities valued using quoted prices from active markets for identical assets; Level 2, which refers to securities not traded on an active market but for which
observable market inputs are readily available; and Level 3, which refers to securities valued based on significant unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, a summary of the U.S. and non-U.S. plans investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2010 and 2009.



There were no
transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during 2010.

The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the plans’ Level 3
assets for the year ended December 31, 2010:

Following is a
description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value.

Company common stock:  Valued at the closing price reported
on the New York Stock Exchange.

Common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible equity securities and rights/warrants (included in Corporate
stocks):  Valued at the closing price reported on the primary exchange.

Corporate bonds (included in corporate obligations):  The
fair value of corporate bonds is estimated using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable) and bond spreads. The spread data used are for the same maturity as the bond. If the spread data does not reference the
issuer, then data that reference a comparable issuer are used. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models.

Commercial paper (included in corporate obligations):  The fair value of commercial paper is estimated using observable market data such as maturity date, issue date, credit rating, current commercial
paper rates and settlement date.

Commercial mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities (included in corporate obligations):  Fair value is
determined using discounted cash flow models. Observable inputs are based on trade and quote activity of bonds with similar features including issuer vintage, purpose of underlying loan (first or second lien), prepayment speeds and credit ratings.
The discount rate is the combination of the appropriate rate from the benchmark yield curve and the discount margin based on quoted prices.

Common
collective trusts:  Valued at the quoted market prices of the underlying investments at year end.



U.S. government bonds (included in government securities):  The fair value of U.S. government bonds is
estimated by pricing models that utilize observable market data including quotes, spreads and data points for yield curves.

U.S. agency securities
(included in government securities):  U.S. agency securities are comprised of two main categories consisting of agency issued debt and mortgage pass-throughs. Agency issued debt securities are valued by benchmarking market-derived prices
to quoted market prices and trade data for identical or comparable securities. Mortgage pass-throughs include certain “To-be-announced” (TBA) securities and mortgage pass-through pools. TBA securities are generally valued using quoted
market prices or are benchmarked thereto. Fair value of mortgage pass-through pools are model driven with respect to spreads of the comparable TBA security.

Private equity/Partnerships:  The fair value of investments in partnership interests is valued by the general partner. The valuations are based on various factors depending on the investment type,
including the cost of the securities, financial data and projections, option valuation models, operating and regulatory issues and other such factors as the General Partner may deem relevant. Investments are valued in the accompanying financial
statements based on the Plan’s beneficial interest in the underlying net assets of the partnership as determined by the partnership agreement.

Insurance group annuity contracts:  The fair values for these investments are based on the current market value of the aggregate accumulated contributions
plus interest earned.

Swap assets and liabilities:  Fair values for interest rate swaps, equity index swaps and inflation swaps are estimated
using a discounted cash flow pricing model. These models use observable market data such as contractual fixed rate, broker quotes, spot equity price or index value and dividend data. The fair values of credit default swaps are estimated using an
income approach model which determines expected cash flows based on default probabilities from the issuer specific credit spread curve and credit loss recovery rates, both of which are dependent on market quotes.

Real estate investment trusts:  Valued at the closing price reported on an exchange.

Short-term investment funds:  Primarily high-grade money market instruments valued at net asset value at year-end.

Real estate: Valued by investment managers generally using proprietary pricing models.

Registered investment
companies:  Valued at the closing price reported on the primary exchange.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company maintains certain defined contribution plans for its employees, including the Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. 401(k) Savings &
Investment Plan (“401(k)”), that are qualified under U.S. tax laws. Under these plans, eligible employees may contribute a percentage of their base salary, subject to certain limitations. For the 401(k), the Company matches a fixed portion
of the employees’ contributions and may also make additional discretionary contributions. The 401(k) contains an Employee Stock Ownership Plan under U.S. tax law. Approximately $334 million of the 401(k)’s assets at December 31, 2010
and $289 million at December 31, 2009 were invested in the Company’s common stock. If a participant does not choose an investment direction for his or her future Company matching contributions, they are automatically invested in a
BlackRock Lifepath Portfolio that most closely matches the participant’s expected retirement year. The cost of these defined contribution plans related to continuing operations was $48 million, $52 million and $53 million for 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively.

9.     Stock Benefit Plans

The Company maintains multiple share-based payment arrangements under which employees are awarded grants of restricted stock units, stock options and other forms of stock-based payment arrangements. Effective
July 1, 2005, the Company adopted the revised guidelines for accounting for stock compensation using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost includes compensation cost for all share-based
payment arrangements granted prior to but not yet vested as of July 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value and expense attribution



methodology determined in accordance with the prior accounting guidance, and compensation cost for all share-based payment arrangements granted subsequent to June 30, 2005, based on the
grant-date fair value and expense attribution methodology determined in accordance with the revised guidance.

Marsh & McLennan Companies,
Inc. Incentive and Stock Award Plans

In 2000, the Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. 2000 Employee Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the
“2000 Employee Plan”) and the Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. 2000 Senior Executive Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the “2000 Executive Plan”) were adopted. The types of awards permitted under these plans include stock
options, restricted stock, stock bonus units, restricted and deferred stock units payable in Company common stock or cash, and other stock-based and performance-based awards. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the
“Compensation Committee”) determines, at its discretion, which affiliates may participate in the plans, which eligible employees will receive awards, the types of awards to be received, and the terms and conditions thereof. The right of an
employee to receive an award may be subject to performance conditions as specified by the Compensation Committee. The 2000 Plans contain provisions which, in the event of a change in control of the Company, may accelerate the vesting of the awards.
Awards relating to not more than 80,000,000 shares of common stock may be made over the life of the 2000 Employee Plan plus shares remaining unused under pre-existing employee stock plans. Awards relating to not more than 8,000,000 shares of common
stock may be made over the life of the 2000 Executive Plan plus shares remaining unused under pre-existing executive stock plans.

Stock
Options:

Options granted under the 2000 Plans may be designated as either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. The Compensation Committee determines the terms and conditions of the option, including the time or
times at which an option may be exercised, the methods by which such exercise price may be paid, and the form of such payment. Options are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the Company common stock on the date of
grant. These option awards generally vest 25% per annum and have a contractual term of 10 years. On March 16, 2005, the Company began granting options that provide for a market-based triggering event before a vested option can be
exercised. The terms and conditions of these stock option awards provide that (i) options will vest at a rate of 25% a year beginning one year from the date of grant and (ii) each vested tranche will only become exercisable if the market
price of the Company stock appreciates to a level of 15% above the exercise price of the option and maintains that level for at least ten (10) consecutive trading days after the award has vested. The Company accounts for these awards as
market-condition options. The effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant-date fair value of such awards. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period and is not subsequently adjusted if the market condition is not
met. For awards without a market-based triggering event, compensation cost is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period which is normally the vesting period.

The estimated fair value of options granted without a market-based triggering event is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model. This model
takes into account several factors and assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumption at the time of grant. The expected life (estimated
period of time outstanding) is estimated using the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees’ expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The Company uses a blended volatility rate based on the
following: (i) volatility derived from daily closing price observations for the 10-year period ended on the valuation date, (ii) implied volatility derived from traded options for the period one week before the valuation date and
(iii) average volatility for the 10-year periods ended on 15 anniversaries prior to the valuation date, using daily closing price observations. The expected dividend yield is based on expected dividends for the expected term of the stock
options.



The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model for options granted by the Company in 2010,
2009 and 2008 are as follows:

The
estimated fair value of options granted with a market-based triggering event is calculated using a binomial valuation model. The factors and assumptions used in this model are similar to those utilized in the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation
model except that the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve over the contractual term of the option, and the expected life is calculated by the model. In 2010, there were no options granted with a market-based
triggering event.

The assumptions used in the binomial option pricing valuation model for options granted during 2009 and 2008 are as follows:

A summary of
the status of the Company’s stock option awards as of December 31, 2010 and changes during the year then ended is presented below:

In the
above table, forfeited options are unvested options whose requisite service period has not been met. Expired options are vested options that were not exercised.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the Company’s option awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $4.85, $4.63, and $6.63, respectively. The total intrinsic
value of options exercised during the same periods was $.5 million, $0 million and $3 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, there was
$23.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s option awards. The weighted-average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is 1.7 years. Cash received from the exercise of stock options for the years
ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $1.5 million, $0 million and $21 million, respectively.

The Company’s policy is to issue treasury
shares upon option exercises or share unit conversion. The Company intends to issue treasury shares as long as an adequate number of those shares are available.



Restricted Stock Units:

Restricted stock units may be awarded under the Company’s Incentive and
Stock Award plans. The Compensation Committee determines the restrictions on such units, when the restrictions lapse, when the units vest and are paid, and upon what terms the units are forfeited. The cost of these awards is amortized over the
vesting period, which is generally three years. Beginning with awards granted in 2006, awards to senior executives and other employees may include three-year performance-based restricted stock units and three-year service-based restricted stock
units. The payout of performance-based restricted stock units (payable in shares of the Company common stock) may range from 0–200% of the number of units granted, based on the achievement of objective, pre-determined company or operating
company performance measures over a three-year performance period. The Company accounts for these awards as performance condition restricted stock units. The performance condition is not considered in the determination of grant date fair value of
such awards. Compensation cost is recognized over the performance period based on management’s estimate of the number of units expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares paid out at the end of the three-year
performance period. Dividend equivalents are generally paid on both performance-based and service-based restricted stock units prior to payout, based on the initial grant amount. Beginning with awards granted on or after February 23, 2009,
dividend equivalents are not paid out unless the award vests.

A summary of the status of the Company’s restricted stock unit awards as of
December 31, 2010 and changes during the period then ended is presented below:

The
weighted-average grant-date fair value of the Company’s restricted stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $19.03 and $26.16, respectively. The total fair value of the Company’s restricted stock units
distributed during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $91.7 million, $35.1 million and $22.4 million, respectively.

Deferred
Stock Units:

Deferred stock units may be awarded under the Company’s incentive and stock award plans. The Compensation Committee determines the restrictions on such units, when the restrictions lapse, when the units vest and are
paid, and upon what terms the units are forfeited. The cost of these awards is amortized over the vesting period, which is generally three years. These units are typically off-cycle awards granted to new hires or as retention awards for employees;
units in this category may also be granted as the equity portion of mandatory deferred bonus awards.

A summary of the status of the Company’s
deferred stock unit awards as of December 31, 2010 and changes during the period then ended is presented below:

The
weighted-average grant-date fair value of the Company’s deferred stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $21.25 and $26.56, respectively. The total fair value of the Company’s deferred stock units
distributed during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $79.0 million, $52.8 million and $71.6 million, respectively.



Restricted Stock:

Restricted shares of the Company’s common stock may be awarded under the
Company’s incentive and stock award plans and are subject to restrictions on transferability and other restrictions, if any, as the Compensation Committee may impose. The Compensation Committee may also determine when and under what
circumstances the restrictions may lapse and whether the participant receives the rights of a stockholder, including, without limitation, the right to vote and receive dividends. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, restricted
stock that is still subject to restrictions is forfeited upon termination of employment. Shares granted generally become unrestricted at the earlier of: (1) January 1 of the year following the vesting grant date anniversary or (2) the
later of the recipient’s normal or actual retirement date. For shares granted prior to 2004, the vesting grant date anniversary is ten years. For shares granted during 2004 and 2005, the vesting grant date anniversary is 7 years and 5 years,
respectively. However, certain restricted shares granted in 2005 vested on the third anniversary of the grant date. There have been no restricted shares granted since 2005.

A summary of the status of the Company’s restricted stock awards as of December 31, 2010 and changes during the period then ended is presented below:

The Company
has not granted restricted stock awards during any year after 2005. The total fair value of the Company’s restricted stock distributed during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $0 million, $0 million and $5.1 million,
respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, there was $206 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock,
restricted stock units and deferred stock unit awards.

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. Stock Purchase Plans

In May 1999, the Company’s stockholders approved an employee stock purchase plan (the “1999 Plan”) to replace the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the “1994 Plan”), which terminated on September 30, 1999 following its fifth annual offering. Under the current terms of the plan, shares are purchased four times during the plan year at a price that is 95% of the average market
price on each quarterly purchase date. Under the 1999 Plan, after including the available remaining unused shares in the 1994 Plan and reducing the shares available by 10,000,000 consistent with the Company’s Board of Directors’ action in
March 2007, no more than 35,600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock may be sold. Employees purchased 1,211,955 shares during the year ended December 31, 2010 and at December 31, 2010, 6,036,074 shares were available for issuance
under the 1999 Plan. Under the 1995 Company Stock Purchase Plan for International Employees (the “International Plan”), after reflecting the additional 5,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance approved by the Company’s Board of
Directors in July 2002, and the addition of 4,000,000 shares due to a shareholder action in May 2007, no more than 12,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock may be sold. Employees purchased 180,638 shares during the year ended
December 31, 2010 and at December 31, 2010, 3,330,696 shares were available for issuance under the International Plan. The plans are considered non-compensatory.

10.    Fair Value Measurements

Fair Value Hierarchy

The Company has categorized its corporate and fiduciary assets and liabilities that are
valued at fair value on a recurring basis into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value measurements of the



plan assets for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans are disclosed separately in Note 8. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure
purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

Financial assets recorded in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs in the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1.

Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market (examples include active exchange-traded equity
securities, listed derivatives, most U.S. Government and agency securities, and certain other sovereign government obligations).

Assets and
liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include exchange traded equity securities and mutual funds.

Level 2.

Financial assets and liabilities whose
values are based on the following:

a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (for example, restricted stock);

b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal bonds,
which trade infrequently);

c) Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability
(examples include most over-the-counter derivatives, including interest rate and currency swaps); and

d) Pricing models whose
inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full asset or liability (for example, certain mortgage loans).

Assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include corporate and municipal bonds.

Level 3.

Financial assets and liabilities, whose values are based on prices, or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
These inputs reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability (examples include private equity investments and certain commercial mortgage whole loans).

Liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs represent contingent consideration on acquisitions.

Valuation Techniques

Equity Securities & Mutual Funds

Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the sale price on their principal exchange, or official closing bid price for certain
markets. If no sales are reported, the security is valued at its last reported bid price.

Other Sovereign Government Obligations, Municipal Bonds
and Corporate Bonds

These investments are valued on the basis of valuations furnished by an independent pricing service approved by the Trustees or
dealers selected by Putnam Investment Management LLC (“Putnam Management”), the fund’s manager, a wholly owned subsidiary of Putnam LLC. Such services or dealers determine valuations for normal institutional-size trading units of such
securities using methods based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships, generally recognized by institutional traders, between securities.

Contingent Consideration Liability

Purchase consideration for many acquisitions made by the Company includes
contingent consideration arrangements. Contingent consideration arrangements are primarily based on meeting EBITDA and revenue targets over two to four years. The fair value of contingent consideration is recorded at the present value of future cash
flows based on the earnings projections of the acquired entities.



The following fair value hierarchy table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:

(a)

Included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

(b)

Included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during 2010.

The table below sets forth a summary of the
changes in fair value of the Company’s Level 3 liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2010 that represents contingent consideration related to acquisitions:

11.    Long-term Commitments

The Company leases office facilities, equipment and automobiles under noncancelable operating leases. These leases expire on varying dates; in some instances contain renewal and expansion options; do not restrict
the payment of dividends or the incurrence of debt or additional lease obligations; and contain no significant purchase options. In addition to the base rental costs, occupancy lease agreements generally provide for rent escalations resulting from
increased assessments for real estate taxes and other charges. Approximately 97% of the Company’s lease obligations are for the use of office space.

The consolidated statements of income include net rental costs of $421 million, $397 million and $427 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, after deducting
rentals from subleases ($8 million in 2010, $5 million in 2009 and $8 million in 2008). The net rental costs disclosed above exclude rental costs and sublease income for previously accrued restructuring charges related to vacated space.



At December 31, 2010, the aggregate future minimum rental commitments under all noncancelable operating lease
agreements are as follows:

The Company has
entered into agreements with various service companies to outsource certain information systems activities and responsibilities and processing activities. Under these agreements, the Company is required to pay minimum annual service charges.
Additional fees may be payable depending upon the volume of transactions processed, with all future payments subject to increases for inflation. At December 31, 2010, the aggregate fixed future minimum commitments under these agreements are as
follows:

12.    Debt

The Company’s outstanding debt is as follows:

During the third
quarter of 2010, the Company repaid its 5.15% ten-year fixed rate $550 million senior notes that matured.

During the second quarter of 2009, the
Company’s 7.125% ten-year fixed rate $400 million senior notes matured. The Company used cash on hand as well as proceeds from the issuance of 9.25% ten-year $400 million senior notes in the first quarter of 2009 to manage liquidity, including
the funding of the maturing notes. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2010 or 2009.



On October 23, 2009, the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new $1.0 billion
multi-currency three-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the $1.2 billion facility discussed below. The interest rate on this facility varies based upon the Company’s credit ratings and the Company’s credit default
swap levels subject to floors and caps. The facility requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2010.

The Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries previously maintained a $1.2 billion multi-currency five-year revolving credit facility. The facility was
previously due to expire in December 2010 and was in effect until October 2009. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at the time it was terminated.

Additional credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit are maintained with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $272 million at December 31,
2010 and $250 million at December 31, 2009. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2010 or December 31, 2009.

The senior notes are publically registered by the Company with no guarantees attached.

Scheduled repayments of
long-term debt in 2011 and in the four succeeding years are $8 million, $260 million, $259 million, $660 million and $760 million, respectively.

13.    Financial Instruments

The estimated fair value of the Company’s significant financial instruments is provided below. Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown
below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company’s intent or need to dispose of the financial instrument.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

:  The estimated fair value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value.

Long-term
Investments

:  Long-term investments include available for sale securities recorded at quoted market prices, certain investments carried at cost and unrealized gains related to available for sale investments in fiduciary funds as
discussed below.

The Company has certain long-term investments, for which there are no readily available market prices, amounting to $39 million and $53
million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which are carried on a cost basis. These investments are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company monitors these investments for impairment and makes
appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary.

The Company had available for sale securities with an aggregate fair value of $23 million and
$38 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which are carried at market value in accordance with ASC Topic No. 320. The Company had gross unrealized gains (pre-tax) on these securities of $8 million and $15 million included in
accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company recorded the following net unrealized gains related to its available for sale securities for the three and twelve month periods ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009:



These amounts have been excluded from earnings and reported, net of deferred income taxes, in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of stockholders’ equity.

The Company has a portion of insurance fiduciary funds described in Note
3 that are invested in high quality debt securities and classified as available for sale. Gross unrealized gains (pre-tax) on these securities that are included in other assets and accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance
sheets were $7 million and $17 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded gross unrealized gain/(losses) (pre-tax) of $(10) million, $(7) million
and $24 million, respectively, related to these investments. These amounts have been excluded from earnings and reported, net of deferred income taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of stockholders’
equity.

Proceeds from the sale of available for sale investments were as follows:

The cost of
securities sold is determined using the average cost method.

The Company also holds investments in certain private equity fund partnerships which are
accounted for using the equity method and other investments that are held at cost. The Company recorded the following gains (losses) related to these investments:

Short-term and
Long-term Debt

:  The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt, which consists primarily of debt maturing within the next year, approximates its carrying value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is
based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.

14.    Integration and Restructuring Costs

Actions Initiated in 2010

In 2010, the Company implemented restructuring actions which resulted in
costs totaling $114 million, primarily related to severance and benefits, and costs for future rent and other real estate costs. Approximately $63 million of these costs related to cost reduction activities for acquisitions made in 2010. These costs
were incurred as follows: Risk and Insurance Services—$81 million, comprising Marsh—$65 million (acquisition related—$46 million) and Guy Carpenter—$16 million (acquisition related—$6 million); Mercer—$25 million
(acquisition related—$11 million) and Corporate—$8 million. These activities resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions at Marsh, 80 positions at Guy Carpenter, 240 positions at Mercer and 70 positions at Corporate. The
annualized cost savings from these actions are expected to be approximately $100 million.

Actions Initiated Prior to 2010

Prior to 2010, the Company implemented several restructuring and cost-saving initiatives related to firm-wide infrastructure, organization structure and operating
company business processes. These initiatives resulted in staff reductions and consolidations of facilities. The Company incurred



restructuring costs of $27 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 in connection with actions initiated in prior years, primarily due to severance and related benefits and
adjustments to the estimated future rent and real estate costs related to previously vacated space.

Details of the activity from January 1, 2009
through December 31, 2010 regarding restructuring activities are as follows:

At January 1, 2008, the
liability balance related to restructuring activity was $112 million. In 2008, the Company accrued $327 million and had cash payments of $217 million related to restructuring activities that resulted in the liability balance at January 1, 2009 as
reported in the above schedule.

The expenses associated with the restructuring plans are included in compensation and benefits and other operating
expenses in the consolidated statements of income, and liabilities associated with these initiatives are classified on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable, other liabilities, or accrued salaries, depending on the nature of the items.

15.    Common Stock

In December 2010, the Company repurchased 3,365,889 shares of its common stock for a total consideration of $85.5 million and an average price per share to the Company of $25.4028. The repurchased shares were
reflected as an increase in treasury shares (a decrease in shares outstanding). This share repurchase was effected under a $500 million share repurchase authorization granted by the Company’s Board of Directors in September 2010. The Company
remains authorized to repurchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of $414.5 million. There is no time limit on this authorization. The Company did not purchase any treasury shares in 2009.

16.    Claims, Lawsuits and Other Contingencies

Errors and Omissions Claims

The Company and its subsidiaries, particularly Marsh and Mercer, are
subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such claims and lawsuits consist principally of alleged errors and omissions in connection with the performance of professional services,
including the placement of insurance and the provision of actuarial services for corporate and public clients. Certain of these claims seek damages, including punitive and treble damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant. In
establishing liabilities for errors and omissions claims in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic No. 450-20 (Contingencies—Loss Contingencies), the Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel and an internal actuarial
analysis to estimate potential losses. A liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a
liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable.

To the extent that expected losses exceed our deductible in any policy year, the Company also records an asset for the amount that we expect to recover under any available third-party insurance programs. The
Company has varying levels of third-party insurance coverage, with policy limits and coverage terms varying significantly by policy year. The Company is not aware of coverage defenses or other obstacles to coverage that would limit recoveries
through policy year 2001-2002 in a material amount. Beginning in 2002, the availability of third-party insurance has declined.



Governmental Inquiries and Related Claims

In January 2005, the Company and its subsidiary Marsh Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the New York State Attorney General (“NYAG”) and the New York State Insurance Department to settle a
civil complaint and related citation regarding Marsh’s use of market service agreements with various insurance companies. The parties subsequently entered into an amended and restated settlement agreement in February 2010 that helps restore a
level playing field for Marsh.

In December 2009, the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York approved a settlement of the purported securities class action lawsuit against the Company, Marsh and certain of their former officers based on similar allegations to those made in the NYAG complaint. Without admitting
liability or wrongdoing of any kind, the Company agreed to pay $425 million, $205 million of which was covered by insurance. The settlement resolved all of the claims in this lawsuit against the Company, Marsh and the named individuals.

Numerous other private party lawsuits based on similar allegations to those made in the NYAG complaint were commenced against the Company, one or more of its
subsidiaries, and their current and former directors and officers. Most of these matters have been resolved. Eight actions instituted by individual policyholders against the Company, Marsh and certain Marsh subsidiaries remain pending in federal and
state courts.

On January 31, 2011, Guy Carpenter entered into a settlement agreement with the Connecticut Attorney General to resolve litigation
initiated in 2007 against Guy Carpenter relating to certain facilities offering reinsurance to small- to midsized insurance companies.

In June 2010, the
Company settled a litigation matter brought by the Alaska Retirement Management Board (“ARMB”) against Mercer. This settlement, in which Mercer expressly denied liability, resolved all claims against Mercer by the ARMB and the State of
Alaska related to this matter. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Mercer paid $500 million, of which $100 million was covered by insurance.

Our activities are regulated under the laws of the United States and its various states, the European Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in
which we operate. In the ordinary course of business we are also subject to investigations, lawsuits and/or other regulatory actions undertaken by governmental authorities.

Other Contingencies—Guarantees

In connection with its acquisition of U.K.-based Sedgwick Group in
1998, the Company acquired several insurance underwriting businesses that were already in run-off, including River Thames Insurance Company Limited (“River Thames”), which we sold in 2001. Sedgwick guaranteed payment of claims on certain
policies underwritten through the Institute of London Underwriters (the “ILU”) by River Thames. The policies covered by this guarantee are reinsured up to £40 million by a related party of River Thames. Payment of claims under
the reinsurance agreement is collateralized by segregated assets held in a trust. As of December 31, 2010, the reinsurance coverage exceeded the best estimate of the projected liability of the policies covered by the guarantee. To the extent
River Thames or the reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations under those policies, a claimant may seek to recover from us under the guarantee.

From
1980 to 1983, the Company owned indirectly the English & American Insurance Company (“E&A”), which was a member of the ILU. The ILU required the Company to guarantee a portion of E&A’s obligations. After E&A
became insolvent in 1993, the ILU agreed to discharge the guarantee in exchange for the Company’s agreement to post an evergreen letter of credit that is available to pay claims by policyholders on certain E&A policies issued through the
ILU and incepting between July 3, 1980 and October 6, 1983. Certain claims have been paid under the letter of credit and we anticipate that additional claimants may seek to recover against the letter of credit.

Putnam-related Matters

Under the terms of a stock
purchase agreement with Great-West Lifeco Inc. (“GWL”) related to GWL’s purchase of Putnam Investments Trust from the Company in August 2007, a copy of which was



included as an exhibit to the Company’s Form 8-K filed on February 1, 2007, we agreed to indemnify GWL with respect to certain Putnam-related litigation and regulatory matters. Most of
these matters have been resolved.

One action by investors in certain Putnam mutual funds, which asserts derivative claims on behalf of the funds against
Putnam regarding excessive short-term trading, remains pending in the District of Maryland, and may be subject to our indemnification obligations.

Kroll-related Matters

Under the terms of a stock
purchase agreement with Altegrity, Inc. (“Altegrity”) related to Altegrity’s purchase of Kroll from the Company in August 2010, a copy of which is attached as an exhibit to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
period ended June 30, 2010, we agreed to provide a limited indemnity to Altegrity with respect to certain Kroll-related litigation and regulatory matters.

The pending proceedings and other matters described in this Note 16 on Claims, Lawsuits and Other Contingencies may expose the Company or its subsidiaries to liability for significant monetary damages and other
forms of relief. Where a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, we establish liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic No. 450-20 (Contingencies—Loss Contingencies). Except as described above, we are not able at this time
to provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. This is primarily because these
matters are still developing and involve complex issues subject to inherent uncertainty. Adverse determinations in one or more of these matters could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows in a future period.

17.    Segment Information

The Company’s organization structure and segment reporting is based on the types of services provided. Under this organizational structure, the Company’s business segments are:

Ÿ

Risk and Insurance Services

, comprising insurance services (Marsh) and reinsurance services (Guy Carpenter); and

Ÿ

Consulting

, comprising Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group.

With the sale of Kroll in August 2010, along with previous divestiture transactions between 2008 and 2010, the Company has now divested its entire Risk Consulting and Technology segment. As described in Note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements, based on the terms and conditions of the divestitures of the corporate advisory and restructuring businesses in 2008, the Company determined it has “continuing involvement” in those businesses, as
that term is used in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5e. Therefore classification of CARG as discontinued operations is not appropriate, and their financial results in the current and prior periods are included in operating income. The run-off
of the Company’s involvement in the CARG businesses is now managed by the Company’s corporate departments, and consequently, the financial results of these businesses are now included in “Corporate” for segment reporting
purposes.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements described in Note 1. The
information in the following table excludes the results of Kroll, which are classified as discontinued operations as described in Note 5. Revenues are attributed to geographic areas on the basis of where the services are performed. Segment
performance is evaluated based on segment operating income, which includes directly related expenses, and charges or credits related to integration and restructuring but not the Company’s corporate-level expenses.



Selected information about the Company’s operating segments and geographic areas of operation are as follows:

(a)

Includes inter-segment revenue ($7 million in 2010, $18 million in 2009 and $5 million in 2008), interest income on fiduciary funds ($45 million in 2010, $54 million in 2009 and
$139 million in 2008) and equity method income of ($12 million in 2010, $13 million in 2009 and $15 million in 2008).

(b)

Includes inter-segment revenue ($43 million in 2010, $45 million in 2009 and $52 million in 2008) and interest income on fiduciary funds ($4 million in 2010, $4 million in 2009
and $10 million in 2008).

(c)

Includes results of corporate advisory and restructuring business.

(d)

Corporate assets primarily include insurance recoverables, pension related assets, the owned portion of the Company headquarters building and intercompany eliminations. Also
includes assets of discontinued operations and the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring business of $0 million, $1,573 million and $1,887 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Details of Operating Segment Revenue are as follows:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Marsh & McLennan
Companies, Inc.

New York, New York

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures relating to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; the recording of all necessary transactions to permit the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles; the proper authorization of receipts and expenditures in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and the prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers. In making this evaluation, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on its evaluation, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that
audited and reported on the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, also issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2010.

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

New York, New
York

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework
