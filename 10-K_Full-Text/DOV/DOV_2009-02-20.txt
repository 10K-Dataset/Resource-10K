PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Dover Corporation (“Dover” or the
    “Company”), incorporated in 1947 in the State of
    Delaware, became a publicly traded company in 1955. The Company
    owns and operates a global portfolio of manufacturing companies
    providing innovative components and equipment, specialty systems
    and support services for a variety of applications in the
    industrial products, engineered systems, fluid management and
    electronic technologies markets. Additional information is
    contained in Items 7 and 8.

Operating
    Structure

The Company reports its results in four business
    segments — Industrial Products, Engineered Systems,
    Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies. Dover discusses
    its operations at the platform level within the Industrial
    Products, Engineered Systems, and Fluid Management segments,
    each of which contains two platforms. Electronic
    Technologies’ results are discussed at the segment level.

    microwave filters, electromagnetic products, frequency
    control/select components and sophisticated automated assembly
    and testing equipment.

Business
    Strategy

The Company operates with certain fundamental business
    strategies. First, it seeks to acquire and own businesses that
    manufacture proprietary engineered industrial products and are
    leaders in four broad markets: Industrial Products, Engineered
    Systems, Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies. To ensure
    success, Dover companies place strong emphasis on new product
    development to better serve customers and expand into



new product and geographic markets. Second, the Company’s
    businesses are committed to operational excellence, and to being
    market leaders as measured by market share, customer service,
    innovation, profitability and return on invested capital. Third,
    the Company is committed to an operating culture with high
    ethical standards, trust, respect and open communication, to
    allow individual growth and operational effectiveness. Fourth,
    the Company seeks to utilize its strong free cash flow in a
    balanced manner to grow its businesses and to increase
    shareholder value.

Management
    Philosophy

The Company’s operating structure of four defined industry
    segments and six core business platforms drives focused
    acquisition activity, accelerates opportunities to identify and
    capture operating synergies, including global sourcing and
    supply chain integration, and advances the development of
    Dover’s executive talent. The presidents of Dover’s
    operating companies and groups have responsibility for their
    businesses’ performance as they are able to serve customers
    by focusing closely on their products and markets, and by
    reacting quickly to customer needs. The Company’s platform,
    segment and executive management sets strategic direction and
    initiatives, provides oversight, allocates and manages capital,
    is responsible for major acquisitions and provides other
    services.

Portfolio
    Development

Acquisitions

Dover’s acquisition program has two elements. First, it
    seeks to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden
    its existing companies and their global reach, manufacture
    innovative components and equipment, specialty systems

and/or

support services, and sell to industrial or commercial users.
    Second, it will strategically pursue larger, stand-alone
    businesses that have the potential to either complement its
    existing companies or allow Dover to pursue a new platform.
    During the period from 2006 through 2008, the Company purchased
    18 businesses with an aggregate cost of $1,494.2 million.

In 2008, the Company acquired four businesses, all of which were
    add-on businesses, for an aggregate cost of $103.8 million.
    In 2007, the Company acquired seven businesses, all of which
    were add-on businesses, for an aggregate cost of
    $273.6 million. In 2006, Dover acquired seven companies
    (five add-ons) for an aggregate cost of $1,116.8 million,
    the highest annual acquisition investment level in its history.

For more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past
    two years, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8. The Company’s future growth
    depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful
    businesses, as a substantial number of the Company’s
    current businesses operate in relatively mature markets. While
    the Company expects to generate annual organic growth of
    5 — 7% over a business cycle, sustained organic growth
    at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to
    achieve consistently each year.

Divestitures

While the Company generally expects to hold businesses that it
    buys, it continually reviews its portfolio to verify that those
    businesses continue to be essential contributors to Dover’s
    long-term growth strategy. In addition, occasionally Dover might
    make an opportunistic sale of one of its companies based on
    specific market conditions and strategic considerations. During
    the past three years (2006 — 2008), the Company
    decided to reduce its exposure to companies that provide capital
    equipment, particularly electronic assembly equipment, as well
    as small, lower margin operations, and, accordingly, it
    discontinued 18 operations and sold 17 operations for an
    aggregate consideration of approximately $629.6 million, of
    which $445.9 million was in 2006. For more details, see the
    “Discontinued Operations” discussion below and
    Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8.

Reportable
    Segments

Below is a description of Dover’s reportable segments and
    related platforms. For additional financial information about
    Dover’s reportable segments, see Note 14 to the

    (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” are presented
    separately in the consolidated statements of operations, balance
    sheets and cash flows and are not included in continuing
    operations. Earnings from discontinued operations include
    charges, when necessary, to reduce these businesses to estimated
    fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is determined by
    either using directly observable inputs, such as a negotiated
    selling price or other valuation techniques that use market
    assumptions that are reasonable and supportable. All interim and
    full year reporting periods presented reflect the continuing
    operations on a comparable basis. Please refer to Note 8 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for additional information on discontinued operations.

Raw
    Materials

Dover’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw
    materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished
    components, which are generally available from a number of
    sources. As a result, shortages or the loss of any single
    supplier have not had, and are not likely to have, a material
    impact on operating profits. While generally available,
    commodity pricing, until recently, has trended upward over the
    past few years, particularly for various grades of steel,
    copper, aluminum and select other commodities, the Company has
    generally kept pace, or exceeded raw material cost increases,
    using effective pricing strategies. Over the second half of
    2008, the Company has experienced, in general, decreases in
    commodity prices.

Research
    and Development

Dover’s operating companies are encouraged to develop new
    products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to
    satisfy customer needs, expand revenue opportunities
    domestically and internationally, maintain or extend competitive
    advantages, improve product reliability and reduce production
    costs. During 2008, $189.2 million of expense was incurred
    for research and development, including qualified engineering
    costs, compared with $193.2 million and $168.9 million
    in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

For the Product Identification and Electronic Technologies
    companies, efforts in these areas tend to be particularly
    significant because the rate of product development by their
    customers is often quite high. The companies that develop
    product identification equipment and specialty electronic
    components for the life sciences, datacom and telecom commercial
    markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of
    product performance improvement and reduced costs. The result
    has been that product life cycles in these markets generally
    average less than five years with meaningful sales price
    reductions over that time period.

Dover’s other segments contain many businesses that are
    also involved in important product improvement initiatives.
    These businesses also concentrate on working closely with
    customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and
    market applications, and continuously improving manufacturing
    processes. Most of these businesses experience a much more
    moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is
    generally experienced by the Product Identification platform and
    the Electronic Technologies segment.

Intellectual
    Property and Intangible Assets

Dover companies own many patents, trademarks, licenses and other
    forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over a
    number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various
    times over a number of years. A large portion of the Dover
    companies’ intellectual property consists of patents,
    unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting
    trade secrets that the companies seek to protect in various
    ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and
    suppliers where appropriate. In addition, a significant portion
    of the Company’s intangible assets relate to customer
    relationships. While the Dover companies’ intellectual
    property and customer relationships are important to their
    success, the loss or expiration of any of these rights or
    relationships, or any groups of related rights or relationships,
    is not likely to materially affect the Company on a consolidated
    basis. The Company believes that its companies’ commitment
    to continuous engineering improvements, new product development
    and improved manufacturing techniques, as well as strong sales,
    marketing and service efforts, are significant to their general
    leadership position in the niche markets that they serve.



Seasonality

In general, Dover companies, while not seasonal, tend to have
    stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, particularly
    companies serving the consumer electronics, transportation,
    construction, waste hauling, petroleum, commercial refrigeration
    and food service markets. Companies serving the major equipment
    markets, such as power generation, chemical and processing
    industries, have long lead times geared to seasonal, commercial
    or consumer demands, and tend to delay or accelerate product
    ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends.

Customers

Dover’s companies serve thousands of customers, no one of
    which accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s
    consolidated revenue in 2008. Within each of the four segments,
    no customer accounted for more than 10% of that segment’s
    revenue in 2008.

With respect to the Engineered Systems, Fluid Management and
    Industrial Products segments, customer concentrations are quite
    varied. Companies supplying the waste handling, construction,
    agricultural, defense, energy, automotive and commercial
    refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers
    that are significant within those industries. This also tends to
    be true for companies supplying the power generation, aerospace
    and chemical industries. In the other markets served, there is
    usually a much lower concentration of customers, particularly
    where the companies provide a substantial number of products as
    well as services applicable to a broad range of end use
    applications.

Certain companies within the Electronic Technologies segment
    serve the military, space, aerospace, commercial and
    datacom/telecom infrastructure markets. Their customers include
    some of the largest operators in these markets. In addition,
    many of the OEM customers of these companies within the
    Electronic Technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to
    Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) companies.
    Other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid
    manufacturers, many of the largest global EMS companies,
    particularly in China, and major printed circuit board and
    semi-conductor manufacturers.

Backlog

Backlog generally is not a significant long-term success factor
    in most of Dover’s businesses, as most of the products of
    Dover companies have relatively short order-to-delivery periods.
    It is more relevant to those businesses that produce larger and
    more sophisticated machines or have long-term government
    contracts, primarily in the Mobile Equipment platform within the
    Industrial Products segment. Total Company backlog as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $1,156.0 million and
    $1,446.4 million, respectively, which reflected the
    meaningful decrease in global economic activity experienced
    during the latter half of 2008, which is expected to continue
    into 2009.

Competition

Dover’s competitive environment is complex because of the
    wide diversity of the products its companies manufacture and the
    markets they serve. In general, most Dover companies are market
    leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key
    competitive factors are customer service, product quality and
    innovation. Dover companies usually have more significant
    competitors domestically, where their principal markets are,
    than in

non-U.S. markets;

however, Dover companies are becoming increasingly global where
    more competitors exist.

Certain companies in the Electronic Technologies and Engineered
    Systems segments compete globally against a variety of
    companies, primarily operating in Europe and the Far East.

International

For

non-U.S. revenue

and an allocation of the assets of the Company’s continuing
    operations, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.



Although international operations are subject to certain risks,
    such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and

non-U.S. governmental

restrictions, Dover continues to increase its expansion into
    international markets, including South America, Asia and Eastern
    Europe.

Most of Dover’s

non-U.S. subsidiaries

and affiliates are based in France, Germany, the United Kingdom,
    the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and, with increased
    emphasis, China, Malaysia, India, Mexico, Brazil and Eastern
    Europe.

Environmental
    Matters

Dover believes its companies’ operations generally are in
    substantial compliance with applicable regulations. In a few
    instances, particular plants and businesses have been the
    subject of administrative and legal proceedings with
    governmental agencies or private parties relating to the
    discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances. Where
    necessary, these matters have been addressed with specific
    consent orders to achieve compliance. Dover believes that
    continued compliance will not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial position and will not require
    significant expenditures or adjustments to reserves.

Employees

The Company had approximately 32,300 employees in
    continuing operations as of December 31, 2008, which was a
    decline of approximately 6% from prior year end, reflecting the
    overall global economic slowdown.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Dover’s business, financial condition, operating results
    and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which
    could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent
    results or from anticipated future results. The risk factors
    discussed in this section should be considered together with
    information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and should not be considered the only risks facing the Company.
    The structure of Dover and the many different markets its
    companies serve mitigate the possibility that any single risk
    factor will materially impact Dover’s consolidated
    financial position.

In general, Dover is subject to the same general risks and
    uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such
    as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and
    growth rates; the impact of natural disasters, and their effect
    on global energy markets; continued events in the Middle East
    and possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the
    worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. The
    Company has identified the following specific risks and
    uncertainties that it considers material:

•

The
    Company’s results for 2009 will be impacted by current
    domestic and international economic conditions and
    uncertainties.

In 2009 Dover’s businesses will be adversely affected by
    disruptions in financial markets or declines in economic
    activity both domestically and internationally in those
    countries in which the Company operates. These circumstances
    will also impact the Company’s suppliers and customers in
    various ways which could have an impact on the Company’s
    business operations, particularly if global credit markets are
    not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial
    commerce. Such negative changes in worldwide economic and
    capital market conditions are beyond the Company’s control,
    are highly unpredictable, and can have an adverse effect on the
    Company’s revenue, earnings, cash flows and cost of capital.



•

Increasing
    price and product/service competition by international and
    domestic competitors including new entrants and the ability of
    Dover to introduce new and competitive products could cause
    Dover’s businesses to generate lower revenue, operating
    profits and cash flows.

Dover’s competitive environment is complex because of the
    wide diversity of the products that its companies manufacture
    and the markets they serve. In general, most Dover companies are
    market leaders that compete with only a few companies. The
    ability of Dover’s companies to compete effectively will
    depend on how successfully they anticipate and respond to
    various competitive factors, including new products and services
    that may be introduced by their competitors, changes in customer
    preferences, and pricing pressures. If Dover’s companies
    are unable to anticipate their competitor’s development of
    new products and services

and/or

identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, they
    could lose customers to competitors. If Dover’s companies
    do not compete effectively or if new products and services fail
    to gain acceptance in the marketplace, Dover companies may
    experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.

•

Some
    of Dover’s companies, may not anticipate , adapt or
    capitalize on technological developments and are subject to the
    cyclical nature of their industries. These factors could cause
    these companies to become less competitive and lead to reduced
    market share, revenue, operating profits and cash
    flows.

Certain Dover companies, particularly in the Electronic
    Technologies segment, sell their products in industries that are
    constantly experiencing change as new technologies are
    developed. In order to grow and remain competitive, the
    companies in these industries must adapt to future changes in
    technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new
    products to address their customers’ changing demands.
    Also, a meaningful portion of the Electronic Technologies
    segment’s revenue is derived from companies which are
    subject to unpredictable short-term business cycles.

The Energy platform in the Fluid Management segment is subject
    to risk due to the volatility of energy prices, although overall
    demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global
    economic conditions and related energy demands. In addition,
    certain of Dover’s businesses manufacture products that are
    used in or related to residential and commercial construction,
    which can be adversely affected by a prolonged downturn in new
    housing starts and other construction markets.

As a result of all the above factors, the revenue and operating
    performance of these companies in any one period are not
    necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating
    performance in other periods, and could have a material impact
    on Dover’s consolidated results of operations, financial
    position and cash flows.

•

Our
    companies could lose customers or generate lower revenue,
    operating profits and cash flows if there are significant
    increases in the cost of energy or raw materials or if they are
    unable to obtain raw materials.

Dover’s companies purchase raw materials, subassemblies and
    components for use in their manufacturing operations, which
    exposes them to volatility in prices for certain commodities.
    Significant price increases for these commodities could
    adversely affect operating profits for certain Dover companies.
    While Dover’s businesses generally attempt to mitigate the
    impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing
    along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time
    delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability
    to increase the prices of products, or they may be unable to
    increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s
    pricing pressure or other factors. In addition, while raw
    materials are generally available now, the inability to obtain
    necessary raw materials could affect the ability to meet
    customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain
    products. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw
    materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss of
    customers and adversely impact revenue, operating profits and
    cash flows.

•

The
    Company’s growth strategy with respect to expansion into
    new geographic markets could be adversely affected if
    Dover’s companies are unable to manage the associated
    risks, particularly in markets outside the U.S.

Approximately 45% of Dover’s revenue is derived outside of
    the United States and the Company continues to focus on
    penetrating new global markets as part of its overall growth
    strategy. This global expansion strategy is subject to, but



not limited to, the following risks and uncertainties:
    political, social and economic instability and disruptions;
    government embargoes or trade restrictions; the imposition of
    duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export
    controls; increased compliance costs; transportation delays and
    disruptions; and difficulties in staffing and managing
    multi-national organizations. In addition, foreign currency
    fluctuations, particularly the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar
    against European currencies, generally has an adverse affect on
    exports and the related revenue and earnings. As a result, if
    the Company is unable to successfully mitigate these risks, they
    could have an adverse affect on the Company’s growth
    strategy as it relates to expanding into new geographic markets
    and its results of operations and financial position.

•

The
    Company’s operating profits and cash flows could be
    adversely affected if the Company cannot achieve projected
    savings and synergies.

Dover is continually evaluating its cost structure and seeking
    ways to capture synergies across its operations. If the Company
    is unable to reduce costs and expenses through its various
    programs, it could adversely affect the Company’s operating
    profits and cash flows.

•

The
    Company’s businesses and their profitability and reputation
    could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental
    and public policy changes (including environmental regulations
    and tax policies such as export subsidy programs, R&E
    credits and other similar programs), risks associated with
    emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and
    unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.

Dover’s domestic and international sales and operations are
    subject to risks associated with changes in local government
    laws (including environmental and export laws), regulations and
    policies. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result
    in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as
    well as potential damage to the Company’s reputation. In
    addition, the Company cannot provide assurance that its costs of
    complying with current or future laws, including environmental
    protection and health and safety laws, will not exceed its
    estimates. In addition, Dover has invested in certain countries,
    including Brazil, Russia, India and China that carry high levels
    of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. While
    these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to
    predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect
    Dover’s businesses and reputation.

Dover’s effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the
    mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax
    rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets
    or tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can
    be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws
    and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international
    authorities. If these audits result in assessments different
    from amounts estimated, the Company’s financial results may
    be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments.

•

Unforeseen
    developments in contingencies such as litigation could adversely
    affect the Company’s financial condition.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are, and from time
    to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings
    incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries
    arising out of the use of their products, exposure to hazardous
    substances or patent infringement, employment matters and
    commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require
    significant expenses, divert management’s attention, and
    the Company may be required to pay damages that could adversely
    affect its financial condition. In addition, any insurance or
    indemnification rights that the Company may have may be
    insufficient or unavailable to protect it against potential loss
    exposures.

•

The
    Company’s revenue, operating profits and cash flows could
    be adversely affected if Dover’s companies are unable to
    protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property
    rights.

Dover companies own patents, trademarks, licenses and other
    forms of intellectual property related to their products. The
    Company employs various measures to maintain and protect their
    intellectual property. These measures may not prevent these
    items from being challenged, invalidated or circumvented,
    particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are
    not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of these
    intellectual



property rights could adversely impact the competitive position
    of Dover’s companies and have a negative impact on their
    revenue, operating profits and cash flows.

•

The
    Company’s growth may be adversely affected if the Company
    is unsuccessful in its acquisition program.

The Company expects to continue its strategy of seeking to
    acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden its
    existing companies and their global reach as well as
    strategically pursuing larger, stand-alone businesses that have
    the potential to either complement our existing companies or
    allow Dover to pursue a new platform. However, there can be no
    assurance that the Company will find suitable businesses to
    purchase, as a substantial number of the Company’s current
    businesses operate in relatively mature markets, or that the
    associated price would be acceptable. If the Company is
    unsuccessful in its acquisition efforts, its ability to continue
    to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely
    affected. In addition, a completed acquisition may underperform
    relative to expectations, be unable to achieve synergies
    originally anticipated, or require the payment of additional
    expenses for assumed liabilities. These factors could
    potentially have an adverse impact on Dover’s operating
    profits and cash flows.

•

The
    Company’s borrowing costs are impacted by its credit
    ratings developed by various rating agencies.

Three major ratings agencies (Moody’s, Standard and
    Poor’s and Fitch) evaluate Dover’s credit profile on
    an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for
    Dover’s long-term debt as of December 31, 2008 (A2, A,
    and A, respectively). In January 2009, Fitch reaffirmed its
    credit rating for Dover with a negative outlook, while the
    ratings and outlooks from the other agencies remained unchanged.
    Although the Company does not anticipate a material change in
    its credit ratings, if the Company’s current credit ratings
    deteriorate, its borrowing costs and access to sources of
    liquidity may be adversely affected.

•

    Outlook

Dover currently anticipates that 2009 revenue will decline
    11%-13%, below 2008 levels and currently does not anticipate a
    recovery in the latter half of 2009 from these demand levels.
    Based on these assumptions, Dover has projected that its
    continuing diluted earnings per share for 2009 will be in the
    range of $2.75 to $3.05, and expects its earnings to follow a
    traditional seasonal pattern of being lower in the first and
    fourth quarters, and higher in the second and third quarters. If
    global or domestic economic conditions deteriorate further,
    Dover’s operating results for 2009 could be materially
    worse than projected.

During 2008, the Company ceased operations in 19 locations, and
    has announced plans in 2009 to cease operations in several
    additional locations, reflecting the current economic climate.
    These reductions and plant consolidations will not restrict the
    Company’s ability to meet customer needs should economic
    conditions improve materially late in 2009 and in 2010.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal
    proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites
    identified under federal and state statutes which provide for
    the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible
    parties.” In each instance, the extent of the
    subsidiary’s liability appears to be very small in relation
    to the total projected expenditures and the number of other
    “potentially responsible parties” involved and is
    anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few
    of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing
    remedial activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with
    regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been
    established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are, and from time
    to time may become, parties to a number of other legal
    proceedings incidental to their businesses. These proceedings
    primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury
    arising out of the use of products of Dover companies, exposure
    to hazardous substances or patent infringement, employment
    matters and commercial disputes. Management and legal counsel
    periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings,
    the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred, the
    availability and extent of insurance coverage, and established
    reserves. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of
    these legal actions or any need for additional reserves, in the
    opinion of management, based on these reviews, it is unlikely
    that the disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters
    mentioned above will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash
    flows or competitive position.

    which appear elsewhere in the

Form 10-K.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
    risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results could
    differ materially from those anticipated in these
    forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,
    including those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Management assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its
    ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and
    financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity
    are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital
    expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchases
    of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper
    and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term
    capital with satisfactory terms. The Company generates
    substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong
    financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for
    reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions
    while managing its capital structure on a short and long-term
    basis.

The following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements
    of Cash Flows:

Years Ended December 31,

)

(332,102

)

Financing activities

(560,904

)

(345,673

)

Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2008
    increased $82.7 million over the prior year primarily
    reflecting higher earnings from continuing operations before
    depreciation and amortization, lower tax payments in 2008 and
    lower receivables, partially offset by higher pension
    contributions.

Cash used in investing activities during 2008 increased
    $120.9 million compared to 2007, largely due to the
    purchase of short-term investments, partially offset by lower
    spending on acquisitions in 2008. Acquisition expenditures in
    2008 were $103.8 million compared to $273.6 million in
    2007, while proceeds from the disposition of businesses were
    essentially flat at $92.8 million, up $1.8 million
    from $91.0 million in 2007. Capital expenditures of
    $175.8 million were generally consistent with the prior
    year level of $173.7 million. The Company currently
    anticipates that any acquisitions made during 2009 will be
    funded from available cash and internally generated funds and,
    if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper,
    established lines of credit or public debt markets. Capital
    expenditures for 2009 are expected to be approximately 30% to
    40% below 2008 levels.

Cash used in financing activities during 2008 increased
    $215.2 million compared to 2007 reflecting higher
    repayments of commercial paper and long-term debt, partially
    offset by $594.1 million in proceeds received from the
    issuance of long-term debt and lower cash spent on share
    repurchases in the 2008 period.

Share
    Repurchases

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, the
    Company repurchased 10,000,000 shares of its common stock
    in the open market at an average price of $46.15 per share. As
    of December 31, 2008, the Company had completed the
    purchases of all shares authorized under its $500 million
    share repurchase program, which was approved by the Board of
    Directors in the fourth quarter of 2007.



During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, the Board of
    Directors approved two separate share repurchase programs
    authorizing repurchases of approximately 20,000,000 common
    shares through the end of 2008. The Company entered into an
    accelerated share repurchase agreement on August 2, 2007
    (“ASR”) under which it purchased 6,000,000 shares
    of its common stock at an initial purchase price of $51.64 per
    share. Upon final settlement of this ASR in the fourth quarter
    of 2007, the final economic purchase price was $48.36 per share,
    representing an average of the volume weighted average price of
    the Company’s common stock during the outstanding period
    less a negotiated discount amount. In addition, during 2007, the
    Company made other open market purchases of its common stock
    totaling 6.4 million shares at an average price of $46.78
    per share.

Adjusted
    Working Capital

Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as
    accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable)
    decreased from the prior year end by $86.0 million, or 6%,
    to $1,275.9 million which reflected a decrease in
    receivables of $91.0 million, a decrease in inventory of
    $37.8 million and a decrease in accounts payable of
    $42.8 million. Excluding acquisitions of
    $18.4 million, dispositions of ($9.6) million and the
    effects of foreign exchange translation of ($38.5) million,
    Adjusted Working Capital would have decreased by
    $56.3 million, or 4%. “Average Annual Adjusted Working
    Capital” as a percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure
    calculated as the five-quarter average balance of accounts
    receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable divided by the
    trailing twelve months of revenue) decreased to 18.3% at
    December 31, 2008 from 18.9% at December 31, 2007 and
    inventory turns were 7.1 at December 31, 2008 compared to
    6.7 at December 31, 2007.

In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage
    based upon the operating, investing and financing
    classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows, the Company also measures free cash flow (a non-GAAP
    measure). Management believes that free cash flow is an
    important measure of operating performance because it provides
    both management and investors a measurement of cash generated
    from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay
    dividends, repay debt and repurchase Dover’s common stock.
    For further information, see Non-GAAP Disclosures at the
    end of this Item 7.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008 was
    $834.6 million or 11.0% of revenue compared to
    $754.0 million or 10.3% of revenue in the prior year. The
    2008 increase in free cash flow reflected higher earnings from
    continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and
    lower tax payments in 2008 and lower receivables and inventory,
    partially offset by higher pension contributions.

The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to
    cash flows from operating activities:

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s net property,
    plant, and equipment totaled $872.1 million compared to
    $892.2 million at the end of 2007. The decrease in net
    property, plant and equipment reflected depreciation and
    disposals, partially offset by capital expenditures of
    $175.8 million, acquisitions of $5.0 million and
    $17.0 million related to foreign currency fluctuations.

The aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities decreased from a $241.2 million net liability
    at the beginning of the year to a net liability of
    $240.7 million at year-end 2008. This resulted primarily
    from a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to
    intangible assets and pension assets, partially offset by a
    decrease in deferred tax assets related to net operating loss
    carryforwards and accrued expenses.

Dover’s consolidated benefit obligation related to defined
    and supplemental retirement benefits decreased by
    $16.9 million in 2008. The decrease was due primarily to
    currency rate changes partially offset by actuarial losses. In
    2008, plan assets decreased by $94.7 million primarily due
    to losses on plan investments and currency fluctuations during



the year, partially offset by Company and employee
    contributions. It is estimated that the Company’s defined
    and supplemental retirement benefits expense will increase from
    $35.7 million in 2008 to approximately $36.4 million
    in 2009.

The Company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization
    calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess its overall financial
    leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to
    investors for the same reason. The following table provides a
    reconciliation of net debt to total capitalization to the most
    directly comparable GAAP measures:

The total debt level of $2,085.7 million at
    December 31, 2008 decreased $5.0 million from
    December 31, 2007 due to a decrease in commercial paper
    borrowings partially offset by an increase in long-term debt.
    Net debt at December 31, 2008 decreased $225.7 million
    as a result of higher cash generated from operations. The
    percentage decrease in net debt to total capital, after
    $462 million of share repurchases, reflects strong free
    cash flow and proceeds from dispositions of $92.8 million.

Dover’s long-term debt instruments had a book value of
    $1,892.9 million on December 31, 2008 and a fair value
    of approximately $2,018.5 million. On December 31,
    2007, the Company’s long-term debt instruments had a book
    value of $1,485.2 million and a fair value of approximately
    $1,496.0 million.

The Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are
    adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable
    risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future.
    Acquisition spending

and/or

share
    repurchases could potentially increase the Company’s debt.
    However, management anticipates that the net debt to total
    capitalization ratio will remain generally consistent with
    historical levels. Operating cash flow and access to capital
    markets are expected to satisfy the Company’s various cash
    flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital
    expenditures.

Management is not aware of any potential impairment to the
    Company’s liquidity. Under the Company’s
    $1 billion

5-year

unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks,
    which expires in November of 2012, the Company is required to
    maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to consolidated
    net interest expense of not less than 3.5 to 1. The Company was
    in compliance with this covenant and its other long-term debt
    covenants at December 31, 2008 and had a coverage ratio of
    13.5 to 1. It is anticipated that in 2009 any funding
    requirements above cash generated from operations will be met
    through the issuance of commercial paper. Given the current
    economic conditions, the Company fully expects to remain in
    compliance with all of its debt covenants.

The Company periodically enters into financial transactions
    specifically to hedge its exposures to various items, including,
    but not limited to, interest rate and foreign exchange rate
    risk. Through various programs, the Company hedges its cash flow
    exposures to foreign exchange rate risk by entering into foreign
    exchange forward contracts and collars. The Company does not
    enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
    purposes and does not have a material portfolio of derivative
    financial instruments.



During the first quarter of 2008, Dover entered into several
    interest rate swaps in anticipation of the debt financing
    completed on March 14, 2008 which, upon settlement,
    resulted in a net gain of $1.2 million which was deferred
    and is being amortized over the lives of the related notes.

There is presently one outstanding swap agreement for a total
    notional amount of $50.0 million, or CHF65.1 million,
    which swaps the

U.S. 6-month

LIBOR rate and the Swiss Franc

6-month

LIBOR rate. This agreement hedges a portion of the
    Company’s net investment in

non-U.S. operations

and the fair value outstanding at December 31, 2008 was a
    loss of $12.0 million which was based on quoted market
    prices for similar instruments (uses Level 2 inputs under
    the SFAS No. 157 hierarchy). This hedge is effective.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company entered into a
    foreign currency hedge which was subsequently settled within the
    quarter in anticipation of a potential acquisition, which did
    not occur. As a result of terminating the hedge, the Company
    recorded a gain of $2.4 million in the third quarter ended
    September 30, 2008.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had open foreign exchange
    forward purchase contracts expiring through December 2009
    related to fair value hedges of foreign currency exposures. The
    fair values of these contracts were based on quoted market
    prices for identical instruments as of December 31, 2008
    (uses Level 1 inputs under the SFAS No. 157
    hierarchy).

Due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future
    uncertain tax positions, management is unable to estimate the
    timing of the related payments, if any, that will be made
    subsequent to 2009. These amounts do not include the potential
    indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for
    payments made to other jurisdictions.

Severance
    and Exit Reserves

From time to time, the Company will initiate various
    restructuring programs at its operating companies or record
    severance and exit costs in connection with purchase accounting
    for acquisitions. During the latter half of 2008, the Company
    announced plans to increase the amount of restructuring efforts
    in response to the significant decline in global economic
    activity. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had
    reserves related to severance and exit activities of
    $31.0 million and $28.4 million, respectively. During
    2008, the Company recorded $27.4 million in additional
    charges and $5.6 million in purchase accounting reserves
    related to acquisitions, partially offset by other non-cash
    write-downs of $2.3 million and payments of
    $28.1 million. These costs yielded a savings of
    approximately $35.0 million in 2008. The Company expects
    further restructuring plans to occur in 2009 resulting in costs
    of approximately $40.0 million that the Company expects
    will yield savings of approximately $75.0 million in 2009.
    Restructuring charges are recorded primarily in Selling and
    administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of
    Operations.

    $6.0 million at Electronic Technologies. These revenue
    increases were due to positive market fundamentals and
    acquisitions at Fluid Management, while Engineered Systems’
    revenue decreased $41.7 million due to weakness in markets
    served by the Engineered Products platform. Overall,
    Dover’s organic revenue growth was 1%, net acquisition
    growth was 1% and the impact from foreign exchange was 1%. Gross
    profit increased 4% to $2,730.0 million from 2007 while the
    gross profit margin remained essentially flat at 36.1% and
    35.8%, in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Selling and administrative expenses of $1,700.7 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 increased
    $86.7 million over the comparable 2007 period, primarily
    due to increased revenue activity, increased professional fees
    and restructuring charges.



Interest expense, net, increased 7% to $96.0 million for
    2008, compared to $89.6 million for 2007 due to higher
    average outstanding borrowings used to fund purchases of the
    Company’s common stock and higher average commercial paper
    rates.

Other expense (income), net for 2008 and 2007 of
    ($12.7) million and $3.5 million, respectively, was
    driven primarily by foreign exchange gains and losses, partially
    offset by other miscellaneous income.

The 2008 and 2007 tax rate for continuing operations was 26.6%
    in both periods, each favorably impacted by the mix of

non-U.S. earnings

in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions.

Net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008
    were $590.8 million or $3.12 EPS, which included a loss
    from discontinued operations of $103.9 million or $0.55
    EPS, compared to net earnings of $661.1 million or $3.26
    EPS for the same period of 2007, including a loss from
    discontinued operations of $8.7 million or $0.04 EPS. The
    losses from discontinued operations in 2008 largely reflect a
    loss provision for a business expected to be sold in 2009, as
    well as tax expenses and tax accruals related to ongoing Federal
    tax settlements and state tax assessments. Refer to Note 8
    in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    information on discontinued operations.

Current
    Economic Environment

With few exceptions, Dover experienced lower demand across all
    of its end markets resulting in lower bookings and backlog in
    the fourth quarter of 2008. Looking forward to 2009, a
    continuation of a weak and uncertain global business environment
    is expected. Though this downturn will have a significant
    adverse impact on revenue and earnings, Dover remains committed
    to maintaining margin levels as much as possible on a full year
    basis, although the Company expects the first quarter to be
    weak, in part due to significant ongoing restructuring efforts.
    The structural changes made over the last few years, becoming
    less dependent on capital goods markets and having greater
    recurring revenue, together with improved working capital
    management and strong pricing discipline is expected to mitigate
    the impact of the economic downturn during 2009. As discussed
    above in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, the
    Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate
    to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based
    interest rates.

The Company’s synergy capture programs and the
    restructuring initiatives launched during 2008 will continue
    into 2009. During 2008, Dover reduced its workforce
    approximately 6% and expects to reduce its workforce further in
    2009 by another 5%. During 2009, the Company will monitor
    business activity across its markets served and adjust capacity
    as necessary should the economic environment worsen. The Company
    will also remain focused on working capital levels and expects
    to generate strong free cash flow during 2009.

Industrial Products increase in revenue over the prior year was
    primarily due to strength in the military and solid waste
    management markets as well as the impact of the December 2007
    acquisition of Industrial Motion Control LLC (“IMC”)
    and the March 2008 acquisition of Lantec Winch and Gear Inc.
    Overall, the segment had 2% revenue growth from its core
    businesses and acquisition growth of 3%, which was partially
    offset by the sale of a line of business. Earnings declined 4%
    when compared to the prior year substantially due to weakness in
    the construction and the North American auto service markets,
    and restructuring costs.

Material Handling revenue decreased 1% while earnings decreased
    5% when compared to the prior year. Revenue and earnings growth
    in the industrial winch business was more than offset by
    softness in the infrastructure, industrial automation and
    automotive markets. In addition, the platform incurred
    additional expenses related to its ongoing cost reduction and
    integration activities.

Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings increased 5% and 2%,
    respectively, over the prior year. The revenue increase was
    primarily due to core business growth as the platform continued
    to experience strength in the aerospace, military and solid
    waste management markets. Softness in the automotive service and
    bulk transport end markets partially offset the increases
    experienced in other markets.

Engineered Systems decreases in revenue and earnings over the
    prior year of 2% and 5%, respectively, were primarily driven by
    the Engineered Products platform. Overall, the segment had a 4%
    decline in revenue from its core businesses which was partially
    offset by the favorable impact of currency rates of 2%.

Engineered Products revenue and earnings decreased 5% and 15%,
    respectively, over the prior year due to weaker sales of retail
    food equipment and softness in the beverage can equipment
    business. In addition to the reduction in overall sales volume
    during the year, the platform’s earnings were negatively
    impacted by currency exchange rates, restructuring and a
    $6.6 million one-time charge primarily related to
    inventory. Partially offsetting these declines were the results
    of the heat exchanger and foodservice businesses which
    experienced continued strength throughout 2008.

Product Identification platform revenue and earnings both
    increased 1% over 2007. The revenue growth was primarily due to
    the favorable impact of foreign exchange as the core businesses
    in the platform experienced lower volume. Despite the decline in
    core business revenue, the platform was able to maintain margins
    consistent with the prior year due to on-going integration
    activities across the platform.

Fluid Management revenue and earnings increased 16% and 27%,
    respectively, over 2007 due to strength in the oil, gas, and
    power generation sectors served by the Energy platform as well
    as the diverse markets served by the Fluid Solutions platform.
    Overall, the segment had organic revenue growth of 12%,
    acquisition growth of 3%, with the remainder due to the
    favorable impact of foreign exchange.

The Energy platform’s revenue increased 21% while its
    earnings improved 32%, when compared to 2007, due to strength in
    the oil and gas markets and increasing power generation demand.
    Earnings and margin benefited from the higher volume and
    operational improvements.

The Fluid Solutions platform revenue increased 10% and earnings
    improved 20% due to acquisitions and strength in the markets
    served by its core businesses. In general, demand remained
    strong for pumps, dispensing systems, and connectors. Earnings
    and margins improved due to a favorable business mix and cost
    savings from the platform’s ongoing cost reduction
    activities.

Electronic Technologies revenue was flat while earnings
    increased 7% when compared to the prior year. Revenue increases
    in the micro-acoustic component business were offset by a
    softening in the other markets served by the segment resulting
    in a 3% decline in core business revenue excluding favorable
    foreign exchange rates. The segment’s earnings benefited
    from the increased volume in the micro-acoustic component
    business, a $7.5 million gain from the sale of a line of
    business (semi-conductor test handling), and cost savings from
    restructuring activities that were implemented in the first
    quarter of 2008.

    COMPARED TO 2006

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 14%
    over 2006, due to increases of $485.1 million at Engineered
    Systems, $283.9 million at Industrial Products and
    $152.4 million at Fluid Management. These revenue increases
    were due to positive market fundamentals and acquisitions, while
    Electronic Technologies’ revenue decreased
    $21.5 million due to weakness in its markets. Overall,
    Dover’s organic revenue growth was 2.4%, acquisition growth
    was 9.5% and the impact from foreign exchange was 2.1%. Gross
    profit increased 14% to $2,619.5 million from 2006 while
    the gross profit margin remained essentially flat at 35.8% and
    35.7% in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Selling and administrative expenses of $1,614.0 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 increased
    $224.8 million over the comparable 2006 period, primarily
    due to increased revenue and increases in compensation and
    pension benefit costs.

Interest expense, net, increased 16% to $89.6 million for
    2007, compared to $77.0 million for 2006 due to higher
    average outstanding borrowings used to fund purchases of the
    Company’s common stock and average commercial paper rates.

Other expense (income), net for 2007 and 2006 of
    $3.5 million and $11.0 million, respectively, was
    driven primarily by foreign exchange losses, partially offset by
    other miscellaneous income.

The 2007 and 2006 tax rates for continuing operations were
    26.6%, and 26.9%, respectively. Both periods were favorably
    impacted by the mix of

non-U.S. earnings

in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions.

Earnings from continuing operations for 2007 were
    $669.8 million or $3.30 EPS compared to $595.7 million
    or $2.90 EPS in 2006. For 2007, net earnings were
    $661.1 million, or $3.26 EPS, which included an
    $8.7 million, or $0.04 EPS, loss from discontinued
    operations, compared to $561.8 million, or $2.73 EPS for
    2006, which included a $33.9 million, or $0.16 EPS, loss
    from discontinued operations. Refer to Note 8 in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
    discontinued operations.

Industrial Products’ revenue and earnings increases over
    the prior year were primarily the result of the acquisition of
    Paladin in August 2006 and the July 2007 acquisition of
    Hanmecson International, a Chinese manufacturer of vehicle
    lifts. For the year, the segment achieved 1% organic growth,
    while growth from acquisitions and the impact of foreign
    exchange accounted for 11% and 1%, respectively.

Material Handling revenue increased 27% while earnings increased
    26% compared to the prior year. The increases were primarily due
    to the Paladin acquisition and improvements in the heavy winch,
    recreational vehicle and industrial automation businesses.
    Margin was impacted by the slowdown in the heavy construction
    business producing attachments and cylinders. In addition, the
    platform benefited from new product introductions, plant
    rationalization and global sourcing during 2007.

Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings increased 3% and 8%,
    respectively, over the prior year. The platform’s results
    benefited from the Hanmecson acquisition and core growth at
    businesses in the petroleum, crude oil and military markets, as
    well as a $5.3 million net pre-tax gain on the sale of a
    facility in the second quarter of 2007. However, softness
    experienced in the automotive service industry and the aerospace
    service business partially offset these gains.

Engineered Systems’ revenue and earnings increases over the
    prior year reflect the December 2006 acquisition of Markem and
    the May 2006 acquisition of O’Neil. Revenue growth due to
    acquisitions was 20%. However, most core businesses also
    improved as the segment achieved organic revenue growth of 8%,
    with the remainder due to the impact of foreign exchange.

Engineered Products’ revenue and earnings increased 14% and
    16%, respectively, over the prior year due to strong supermarket
    and heat exchanger markets. Sequentially, revenue and earnings
    in the fourth quarter of 2007 were down 9% and 18%,
    respectively, reflecting normal seasonality and a slowdown in
    retail food equipment demand, along with reduced orders tied to
    high customer inventory levels in the heat exchanger business.

The Product Identification platform had revenue and earnings
    increases of 61% and 41%, respectively, during 2007 mostly
    reflecting the 2006 acquisitions of Markem and O’Neil.
    Overall, the revenue growth due to the 2006 acquisitions was
    55%, while organic growth was 3% due to growth in the core
    direct coding business with the remainder due to foreign
    exchange.

Fluid Management’s revenue and earnings increases were the
    result of strength at all businesses in the segment. The segment
    continued to benefit from strong results from the Energy
    platform which serves the oil, gas and power generation markets.
    As a result, the segment achieved organic growth of 9%, with the
    remainder primarily from foreign exchange.

The Energy platform’s revenue and earnings increased 13%
    and 15%, respectively, primarily due to strong oil and gas
    markets and increased power generation demand throughout 2007.
    The platform’s earnings growth further benefited from
    higher volume, productivity gains and operational improvements.

Fluid Solutions revenue and earnings both increased 10% when
    compared to the prior year due to improvements at all core
    businesses in the platform. Throughout 2007, the platform
    experienced strong demand in the chemical and rail markets.
    Overall, the platform had organic revenue growth of 6%, growth
    from acquisitions of 2%, with the remainder due to foreign
    exchange.

Electronic Technologies’ year-over-year decreases in
    revenue and earnings were primarily due to softness in the
    semi-conductor end markets throughout 2007 compared to strong
    markets experienced in the prior year. The medical and
    military/space markets were strong throughout the year, while
    telecom markets remained flat. Overall, the increase in revenue
    due to acquisitions and foreign exchange were each 3%, while
    organic revenue decreased 8%.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The Company’s consolidated financial statements and related
    public financial information are based on the application of
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates,
    assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of
    accounting principles that have an impact on the assets,
    liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These
    estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in
    the public disclosures of the Company, including information
    regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The
    Company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting
    assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied.
    Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on
    a consistent basis throughout the Company. Primary areas where
    the financial information of Dover is subject to the use of
    estimates, assumptions and the application of judgment include
    the following areas:

•

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances
    are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, b) price is fixed or determinable,
    c) collectability is reasonably assured, and
    d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where
    installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the
    installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of
    the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving
    non-essential installation obligations are those which can
    generally be completed in a short period of time at
    insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these
    installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases
    can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the
    installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the
    delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until
    installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined
    that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the
    Company will allocate consideration received to the separate
    deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize
    revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable
    identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other
    post shipment obligations such as training and customer
    acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is
    deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance
    has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned
    when services are performed.

•

Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual
    operating companies based on estimates of losses related to
    customer receivable balances. Estimates are developed by using
    standard quantitative measures based on historical losses,
    adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases,
    evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The
    establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and
    assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable
    balances. Due to the fact that Dover operates in many different
    markets, changes in economic conditions in specific markets
    generally should not have a material effect on reserve balances
    required.



•

Inventory for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries,
    including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the
    lower of cost, determined on the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is
    stated at cost, determined on the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under
    certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the
    valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly
    value inventory. The Electronic Technologies companies tend to
    experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value
    fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of
    product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time.

•

Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves
    at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting
    principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs,
    require the use of estimates. Though Dover believes that these
    estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual
    results may be different than the estimated amounts.

•

Dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its
    balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles
    related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of
    these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and
    amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of
    estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established
    accounting guidelines (including
    SFAS No. 142) for impairment also requires
    significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it
    relates to the identification of reporting units and the
    determination of fair market value. Dover’s assets and
    reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an
    annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of
    impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the
    business climate, during the interim periods. The Company
    believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are
    reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting
    principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially
    require adjustments to the valuations.

•

The valuation of Dover’s pension and other post-retirement
    plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are
    used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and
    assets/liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates,
    investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and
    mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in Dover’s
    pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with
    external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for
    Dover’s future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions
    and future investment returns could potentially have a material
    impact on Dover’s pension expenses and related funding
    requirements. Dover’s expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns,
    economic trends and portfolio allocation. Dover’s discount
    rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based
    on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the
    plans’ expected benefit payment streams. The plans’
    expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting

year-by-year

spot rates.

•

Dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are
    reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets
    are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income
    streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are
    also estimated, using a more likely than not criteria, for
    ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues
    that are currently unresolved. The Company routinely monitors
    the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is
    properly reserved. Valuations related to tax accruals and assets
    can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in
    tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and the
    Company’s future taxable income levels.

•

Dover has significant accruals and reserves related to the
    self-insured portion of its risk management program. These
    accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard
    to risk exposure and ultimate liability. The Company estimates
    losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions,
    Dover’s experience, and relevant industry data. Dover
    reviews these factors quarterly and considers the current level
    of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market
    conditions and Company experience.

•

Dover has established reserves for environmental and legal
    contingencies at both the operating company and corporate
    levels. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is
    required to quantify Dover’s ultimate exposure in these
    matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed
    on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to
    ensure that Dover is properly reserved. Reserve balances are
    adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing
    issues and the establishment of additional



reserves for emerging issues. While Dover believes that the
    current level of reserves is adequate, future changes in
    circumstances could impact these determinations.

•

The Company from time to time will discontinue certain
    operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if
    necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations
    to their estimated fair market value less costs to sell. These
    estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds
    anticipated as a result of the sale. The adjustments to fair
    market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain
    or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the
    inability to sell an operation could potentially require future
    adjustments to these estimates.

•

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate
    the fair value of its Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) and stock
    options that are granted to employees. The model requires
    management to estimate the expected life of the SAR or option,
    expected forfeitures and the volatility of Dover’s stock
    using historical data. For additional information related to the
    assumptions used, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Adoption
    of New Accounting Standards


Pensions

Effective December 31, 2006, Dover adopted
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”).
    SFAS No. 158 requires companies to report the funded
    status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans on their balance sheets as a net liability or
    asset. Upon adoption at December 31, 2006, Dover recorded a
    net reduction to stockholders’ equity of
    $123.5 million, net of tax. In addition, effective for
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, the new
    standard requires companies to measure benefit obligations and
    plan assets as of a Company’s fiscal year end
    (December 31, 2008 for Dover), using one of the methods
    prescribed in the standard. Dover adopted the new valuation date
    requirements using the

15-month

alternative, as prescribed in the standard, which resulted in a
    charge of approximately $5.8 million, net of tax, to
    retained earnings during the fourth quarter of 2008.

Fair
    Value

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”
    (“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
    accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. For financial assets and
    liabilities, this statement is effective for fiscal periods
    beginning after November 15, 2007 and does not require any
    new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB Staff
    Position

No. 157-2

was issued which delayed the effective date of FASB Statement
    No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2008 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material
    effect on Dover’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” This statement permits entities to choose to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value. This statement is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
    including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company
    did not elect the fair value option for any of its existing
    financial instruments as of December 31, 2008 and the
    Company has not determined whether or not it will elect this
    option for financial instruments it may acquire in the future.


Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB
    Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”) which
    specifies the way companies are to account for uncertainty in
    income tax reporting, and prescribes a methodology for



recognizing, reversing and measuring the tax benefits of a tax
    position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. As a
    result of adopting the new standard, the Company recorded a
    $58.2 million increase to reserves as a “cumulative
    effect” decrease to opening retained earnings as of
    January 1, 2007, of which $53.4 million was included
    in continuing operations. Including this “cumulative
    effect” adjustment, the Company had unrecognized tax
    benefits, net of indirect benefits and deposits, of
    $190.5 million at January 1, 2007, of which
    $35.4 million related to accrued interest and penalties.
    The portion of the unrecognized tax benefits at January 1,
    2007 included in continuing operations totaled
    $147.6 million, of which $28.0 million related to
    accrued interest and penalties.


Effective January, 1 2006, Dover adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standard No. 123(R), “Share Based
    Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which no
    longer permits the use of the intrinsic value method under APB
    No. 25. The Company used the modified prospective method to
    adopt SFAS No. 123(R), which requires compensation
    expense to be recorded for all stock-based compensation granted
    on or after January 1, 2006, as well as the unvested
    portion of previously granted options. The Company records
    stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis,
    generally over the explicit service period of three years
    (except for retirement eligible employees and retirees). Awards
    granted to retirement eligible employees are expensed
    immediately and the Company shortens the vesting period for any
    employee who will become eligible to retire within the
    three-year explicit service period. Expense for these employees
    is be recorded over the period from the date of grant through
    the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no
    longer required to provide service.

Recent
    Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007), “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS No. 141(R)”).
    SFAS No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements
    in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting
    (which Statement 141 called the purchase method) be used for all
    business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for
    each business combination. In general, the statement
    1) broadens the guidance of SFAS No. 141,
    extending its applicability to all events where one entity
    obtains control over one or more other businesses,
    2) broadens the use of fair value measurements used to
    recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
    3) changes the accounting for acquisition related fees and
    restructuring costs incurred in connection with an acquisition,
    and 4) increases required disclosures. The Company will
    apply the provisions of this statement prospectively to business
    combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after
    January 1, 2009 and can only assess the impact of the
    standard once an acquisition is consummated.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 requires that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity
    and the amount of consolidated net income specifically
    attributable to the noncontrolling interest be identified in the
    consolidated financial statements. It also requires consistency
    in the manner of reporting changes in the parent’s
    ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any
    noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation.
    The Company will apply the provisions of this statement
    prospectively, as required, beginning on January 1, 2009
    and does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a
    material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
    (“SFAS No. 161”). SFAS No. 161
    amends and expands the disclosure requirements of
    SFAS No. 133 with the intent to provide users of
    financial statements with an enhanced understanding of:
    1) How and why an entity uses derivative instruments;
    2) How derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related
    interpretations; and 3) How derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance and cash flows. This statement is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
    interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with
    early application encouraged. The Company does not expect the
    adoption of SFAS No. 161 to have a material impact on
    its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.”
    This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles
    and the framework for selecting the principles to be



used in the preparation of financial statements of
    nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United
    States (the GAAP hierarchy). This Statement is effective
    60 days following the SEC’s approval of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU
    Section 411, “The Meaning of Present Fairly in
    Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.”
    The adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. 142-3

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets” (“FSP

No. 142-3”)

to improve the consistency between the useful life of a
    recognized intangible asset (under
    SFAS No. 142) and the period of expected cash
    flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible asset
    (under SFAS No. 141(R)). FSP

No. 142-3

amends the factors to be considered when developing renewal or
    extension assumptions that are used to estimate an intangible
    asset’s useful life under SFAS No. 142. The
    guidance in the new staff position is to be applied
    prospectively to intangible assets acquired after
    December 31, 2008. In addition, FSP

No. 142-3

increases the disclosure requirements related to renewal or
    extension assumptions.

Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information
    regarding the Company’s results as determined by generally
    accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company also
    discloses non-GAAP information which management believes
    provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net
    debt, total debt, total capitalization, adjusted working
    capital, average annual adjusted working capital, revenues
    excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures
    under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash
    flows from operating activities, debt or equity, revenue and
    working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they
    may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by
    other companies. Management believes the (1) net debt to
    total capitalization ratio and (2) free cash flow are
    important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net
    debt to total capitalization is helpful in evaluating the
    Company’s capital structure and the amount of leverage it
    employs. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a
    measurement of cash generated from operations that is available
    to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase
    the Company’s common stock. Reconciliations of free cash
    flow, total debt and net debt can be found above in this
    Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
    Management believes that reporting adjusted working capital
    (also sometimes called “working capital”), which is
    calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts
    payable, provides a meaningful measure of the Company’s
    operational results by showing the changes caused solely by
    revenue. Management believes that reporting adjusted working
    capital and revenues at constant currency, which excludes the
    positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of the
    Company’s operational changes, given the global nature of
    Dover’s businesses. Management believes that reporting
    organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign
    currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions, provides
    a useful comparison of the Company’s revenue performance
    and trends between periods.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rates

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in
    interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of long-term
    fixed interest rate debt, interest rate swaps attached thereto,
    commercial paper borrowings and investments in cash equivalents.
    Generally, the fair market value of fixed-interest rate debt
    will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest
    rates rise.

•

A 54 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates
    (10% of the Company’s weighted average long-term debt
    interest rate) would have an immaterial effect on the fair value
    of the Company’s long-term debt.

•

Commercial paper borrowings are at variable interest rates, and
    have maturities of three months or less. A 25 basis point
    increase or decrease in the interest rates (10% of the
    Company’s weighted average commercial paper interest rate)
    on commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial impact
    on the Company’s pre-tax earnings.



•

All highly liquid investments, including highly liquid debt
    instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months
    or less, are considered cash equivalents. The Company places its
    investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers
    and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer. A
    15 basis point decrease or increase in interest rates (10%
    of the Company’s weighted average interest rate) would have
    an immaterial impact on the Company’s pre-tax income.

•

Short-term investments consist of bank term deposits that have
    maturity dates that range from five to nine months. A
    50 basis point decrease or increase in interest rates (10%
    of the Company’s weighted average interest rate) would have
    an immaterial impact on the Company’s pre-tax income.

•

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had one interest rate
    swap outstanding, as discussed in Note 9 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not enter
    into derivative financial or derivative commodity instruments
    for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign
    Exchange

The Company conducts business in various

non-U.S. countries,

primarily in Canada, Mexico, substantially all of the European
    countries, Brazil, Argentina, Malaysia, China, India and other
    Asian countries. Therefore, changes in the value of the
    currencies of these countries affect the Company’s
    financial position and cash flows when translated into
    U.S. Dollars. The Company has generally accepted the
    exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment
    in

non-U.S. operations.

The Company may, from time to time, for a specific exposure,
    enter into fair value hedges. Certain individual operating
    companies that have foreign exchange exposure have established
    formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair
    value

and/or

cash flow hedging. The Company has mitigated and will continue
    to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation
    of

non-U.S. operating

companies in which the majority of all costs are local-currency
    based. A change of 10% or less in the value of all foreign
    currencies would not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position and cash flows.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

.

Based on its assessment under the criteria set forth in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

,
    management concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles.

In making its assessment of internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, management has excluded
    those companies acquired in purchase business combinations
    during 2008, which included LANTEC Winch & Gear Inc.,
    Brady’s Mining and Construction Supply Co., Neptune
    Chemical Pump Company and Hiltap Fittings Ltd. These companies
    are wholly-owned by the Company and their total revenue for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 represents approximately 0.7%
    of the Company’s consolidated total revenue for the same
    period and their assets represent approximately 1.5% of the
    Company’s consolidated assets as of December 31, 2008.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
    herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Dover Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of Dover Corporation and its subsidiaries
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008 based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in “Management’s Report
    on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” appearing
    under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
    these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule,
    and on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
    audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
    material misstatement and whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain income tax positions in 2007 and defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement obligations in 2006 and 2008.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



As described in “Management’s Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting,” management has excluded
    LANTEC Winch & Gear Inc., Brady’s Mining and
    Construction Supply Co., Neptune Chemical Pump Company and
    Hiltap Fittings Ltd. from its assessment of internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 because
    they were acquired by the Company in purchase business
    combinations during 2008. We have also excluded LANTEC
    Winch & Gear Inc., Brady’s Mining and
    Construction Supply Co., Neptune Chemical Pump Company and
    Hiltap Fittings Ltd. from our audit of internal control over
    financial reporting. These companies are wholly owned by the
    Company and their total assets and revenue represent
    approximately 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively, of the related
    consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Description
    of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Description
    of Business

Dover Corporation (“Dover” or the “Company”)
    is a diversified, multinational manufacturing corporation
    comprised of operating companies which manufacture a broad range
    of specialized industrial products and components as well as
    related services and consumables. The Company also provides
    engineering, testing and other similar services, which are not
    significant in relation to consolidated revenue. Dover’s
    operating companies are based primarily in the United States of
    America and Europe with manufacturing and other operations
    throughout the world. The Company reports its results in four
    segments, Industrial Products, Engineered Systems, Fluid
    Management and Electronic Technologies. For additional
    information on Dover’s segments, see Note 14.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
    The results of operations of purchased businesses are included
    from the dates of acquisitions. The assets, liabilities, results
    of operations and cash flows of all discontinued operations have
    been separately reported as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented. Certain amounts in prior years have been
    reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue
    and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may be
    adjusted due to changes in future economic, industry or customer
    financial conditions, as well as changes in technology or
    demand. Significant estimates include allowances for doubtful
    accounts receivable, net realizable value of inventories,
    restructuring reserves, valuation of goodwill and intangible
    assets, pension and post retirement assumptions, useful lives
    associated with amortization and depreciation of intangibles and
    fixed assets, warranty reserves, income taxes and tax valuation
    reserves, environmental reserves, legal reserves, insurance
    reserves and the valuations of discontinued assets and
    liabilities.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits
    and short-term investments which are highly liquid in nature and
    have original maturities at the time of purchase of three months
    or less.

Short-Term
    Investments

Short-term investments consist of bank term deposits that have
    original maturity dates that range from six to nine months. At
    December 31, 2008 the Company has $279.5 million of
    bank term deposits that earn a weighted average interest rate of
    4.68%.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable is composed principally of trade accounts
    receivable that arise primarily from the sale of goods or
    services on account and are stated at historical cost.
    Management at each operating company evaluates accounts
    receivable to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that
    will not be collected in the future and records the appropriate
    provision. The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a
    charge to operating expense and reduces accounts receivable. The
    estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based primarily on
    management’s evaluation of the aging of the accounts
    receivable balance, the financial condition of its customers,
    historical trends and the time outstanding of specific balances.
    Actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from
    management’s estimates due to changes in future economic,
    industry or customers’ financial conditions.



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade
    receivables, accounts payable, notes payable and accrued
    expenses approximates fair value due to the short maturity, less
    than one year, of these instruments.

Inventories

Inventories for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries,
    including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the
    lower of cost, determined on the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is
    stated at cost, determined on the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Future
    inventory valuations could differ from management’s
    estimates due to changes in economic, industry or customer
    financial conditions, as well as unanticipated changes in
    technology or demand.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment includes the historic cost of
    land, buildings, equipment and significant improvements to
    existing plant and equipment or in the case of acquisitions, a
    fair market value appraisal of such assets completed at the time
    of acquisition. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor
    renewals are expensed as incurred. When property or equipment is
    sold or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
    depreciation is removed from the respective accounts and the
    gain or loss realized on disposition is reflected in earnings.
    Depreciation expense was $159.3 million in 2008,
    $151.7 million in 2007, and $128.8 million in 2006 and
    was calculated on a straight-line basis for assets acquired
    during all periods presented. The Company depreciates its assets
    over their estimated useful lives as follows: buildings 5 to
    31.5 years; machinery and equipment 3 to 7 years;
    furniture and fixtures 3 to 7 years; and vehicles
    3 years.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company periodically enters into financial transactions
    specifically to hedge its exposures to various items, including,
    but not limited to, interest rate and foreign exchange rate
    risk. Through various programs, the Company hedges its cash flow
    exposures to foreign exchange rate risk by entering into foreign
    exchange forward contracts and collars. The Company does not
    enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
    purposes and does not have a material portfolio of derivative
    financial instruments.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” and related amendments
    and interpretations, the Company recognizes all derivatives as
    either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures
    those instruments at fair value. If the derivative is designated
    as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair
    value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to
    the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period.
    If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portions of changes in the fair value of the
    derivative are recorded in other comprehensive earnings and are
    recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item
    affects income. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair
    value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

Tests for hedge ineffectiveness are conducted periodically and
    any ineffectiveness found is recognized in the statement of
    operations. The fair market value of all outstanding
    transactions is recorded in Other assets and deferred charges,
    or in the Other deferrals section of the balance sheet, as
    applicable. The corresponding change in value of the hedged
    assets/liabilities is recorded directly in that section of the
    balance sheet.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses
    over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,” the Company does not amortize goodwill.
    Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually unless
    indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained
    change in the business climate, during the interim periods.

For 2008 and 2007, the Company identified 10 and 11 reporting
    units, respectively, for its annual goodwill test which was
    performed as of September 30. Step one of the test compared
    the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash
    flow method to its book value. This method uses the
    Company’s own market assumptions which are reasonable and
    supportable. Step two, which compares the book value of the
    goodwill to its implied fair value, was not necessary since
    there were no indicators of potential impairment from step one.
    For information related to the amount of the Company’s
    goodwill by segment, see Note 7.

Indefinite-Lived
    Intangible Assets

Similar to goodwill, the Company tests indefinite-lived,
    intangible assets (primarily trademarks) at least annually
    unless indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant
    sustained change in the business climate, during the interim
    periods. In performing these tests, the Company uses a
    discounted cash flow method to calculate and compare the fair
    value of the intangible to its book value. This method uses the
    Company’s own market assumptions which are reasonable and
    supportable. If the fair value is less than the book value of
    the intangibles, an impairment charge would be recognized. For
    information related to the amount of the Company’s
    intangible asset classes, see Note 7.

Long-Lived
    Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”
    long — lived assets (including intangible assets that
    are amortized) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
    asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant sustained
    change in the business climate, during the interim periods.  If
    an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an
    estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is produced and
    compared to its carrying value. If an asset is determined to be
    impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying
    amount of the asset over its



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future
    cash flows. There were no indicators of impairment noted during
    2008, therefore no tests were performed for long-lived assets.

Foreign
    Currency

Assets and liabilities of

non-U.S. subsidiaries,

where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have
    been translated at year-end exchange rates and profit and loss
    accounts have been translated using weighted average yearly
    exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from translation have been
    recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as
    cumulative translation adjustments. Assets and liabilities of an
    entity that are denominated in currencies other than an
    entity’s functional currency are remeasured into the
    functional currency using end of period exchange rates or
    historical rates where applicable to certain balances. Gains and
    losses related to these remeasurements are recorded within the
    Statement of Operations as a component of Other Expense
    (Income), net.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances
    are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, b) price is fixed or determinable,
    c) collectability is reasonably assured, and
    d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where
    installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the
    installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of
    the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving
    non-essential installation obligations are those which can
    generally be completed in a short period of time at
    insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these
    installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases
    can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the
    installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the
    delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until
    installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined
    that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the
    Company will allocate consideration received to the separate
    deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize
    revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable
    identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other
    post-shipment obligations such as training and customer
    acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is
    deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance
    has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned
    when services are performed and is not significant to any period
    presented.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company records stock-based compensation expense on a
    straight-line basis, generally over the explicit service period
    of three years (except for retirement eligible employees and
    retirees). Awards granted to retirement eligible employees are
    expensed immediately and the Company shortens the vesting
    period, for expensing purposes, for any employee who will become
    eligible to retire within the three-year explicit service
    period. Expense for these employees is recorded over the period
    from the date of grant through the date the employee first
    becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide
    service. For additional information related to stock-based
    compensation, including activity for 2008, 2007 and 2006, see
    Note 10.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes on continuing operations includes
    federal, state, local and

non-U.S. taxes.

Tax credits, primarily for research and experimentation and

non-U.S. earnings,

export programs, and U.S. manufacturer’s tax deduction
    are recognized as a reduction of the provision for income taxes
    on continuing operations in the year in which they are available
    for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are provided on temporary
    differences between assets and liabilities for financial and tax
    reporting purposes as measured by enacted tax rates expected to
    apply when temporary differences are settled or realized. Future
    tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of
    those benefits is considered to be more likely than not. A
    valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for
    which realization is not assured. The Company has not provided
    for any residual U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings
    of

non-U.S. subsidiaries

as such earnings are currently intended to be indefinitely
    reinvested.



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB
    Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”) which
    specifies the way companies are to account for uncertainty in
    income tax reporting, and prescribes a methodology for
    recognizing, reversing and measuring the tax benefits of a tax
    position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. As a
    result of adopting FIN 48, the Company recorded a
    $58.2 million increase to reserves as a “cumulative
    effect” decrease to opening retained earnings as of
    January 1, 2007, of which $53.4 million was included
    in continuing operations. Including this “cumulative
    effect” adjustment, the Company had unrecognized tax
    benefits, net of indirect benefits and deposits, of
    $190.5 million at January 1, 2007, of which
    $35.4 million related to accrued interest and penalties.
    The portion of the unrecognized tax benefits at January 1,
    2007 included in continuing operations totaled
    $147.6 million, of which $28.0 million related to
    accrued interest and penalties. For additional information on
    the Company’s income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits,
    see Note 11.

Research
    and Development Costs

Research and development costs, including qualifying engineering
    costs, are expensed when incurred and amounted to
    $189.2 million in 2008, $193.2 million in 2007 and
    $168.9 million in 2006.

Risk,
    Retention, Insurance

The Company’s property and casualty insurance programs
    contain various deductibles that, based on the Company’s
    experience, are typical and customary for a company of its size
    and risk profile. The Company does not consider any of the
    deductibles to represent a material risk to the Company. The
    Company generally maintains deductibles for claims and
    liabilities related primarily to workers’ compensation,
    health and welfare claims, general commercial, product and
    automobile liability and property damage, and business
    interruption resulting from certain events. The Company accrues
    for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be
    reasonably estimated. As part of the Company’s risk
    management program, insurance is maintained to transfer risk
    beyond the level of self-retention and provides protection on
    both an individual claim and annual aggregate basis. The Company
    currently self-insures its product and commercial general
    liability claims up to $5.0 million per occurrence, its
    workers’ compensation claims up to $0.5 million per
    occurrence, and automobile liability claims up to
    $1.0 million per occurrence. Third-party insurance provides
    primary level coverage in excess of these amounts up to certain
    specified limits. In addition, the Company has excess liability
    insurance from third-party insurers on both an aggregate and an
    individual occurrence basis well in excess of the limits of the
    primary coverage. A worldwide program of property insurance
    covers the Company’s owned and leased property and any
    business interruptions that may occur due to an insured hazard
    affecting those properties, subject to reasonable deductibles
    and aggregate limits.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Effective December 31, 2006, Dover adopted
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”). For
    additional information on the impact of adopting
    SFAS No. 158, see Note 2 “Adoption of New
    Accounting Standards” below and for additional detail
    related to Dover’s employee benefit plans, see Note 13.

Recent
    Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007), “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS No. 141(R)”).
    SFAS No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements
    in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting
    (which Statement 141 called the purchase method) be used for all
    business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for
    each business combination. In general, the statement
    1) broadens the guidance of SFAS No. 141,
    extending its applicability to all events where one entity
    obtains control over one or more other businesses,
    2) broadens the use of fair value measurements used to
    recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
    3) changes the accounting for acquisition related fees and
    restructuring costs incurred in connection with



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

an acquisition, and 4) increases required disclosures. The
    Company will apply the provisions of this statement
    prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition
    date is on or after January 1, 2009 and can only assess the
    impact of the standard once an acquisition is consummated.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 requires that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity
    and the amount of consolidated net income specifically
    attributable to the noncontrolling interest be identified in the
    consolidated financial statements. It also requires consistency
    in the manner of reporting changes in the parent’s
    ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any
    noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation.
    The Company will apply the provisions of this statement
    prospectively, as required, beginning on January 1, 2009
    and does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a
    material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
    (“SFAS No. 161”). SFAS No. 161
    amends and expands the disclosure requirements of
    SFAS No. 133 with the intent to provide users of
    financial statements with an enhanced understanding of:
    1) How and why an entity uses derivative instruments;
    2) How derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related
    interpretations; and 3) How derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance and cash flows. This statement is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
    interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with
    early application encouraged. The Company does not expect the
    adoption of SFAS No. 161 to have a material impact on
    its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.”
    This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles
    and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the
    preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities
    that are presented in conformity with generally accepted
    accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (the GAAP
    hierarchy). This Statement was effective 60 days following
    the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, “The
    Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles.” The adoption of this statement did
    not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. 142-3

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets” (“FSP

No. 142-3”)

to improve the consistency between the useful life of a
    recognized intangible asset (under
    SFAS No. 142) and the period of expected cash
    flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible asset
    (under SFAS No. 141(R)). FSP

No. 142-3

amends the factors to be considered when developing renewal or
    extension assumptions that are used to estimate an intangible
    asset’s useful life under SFAS No. 142. The
    guidance in the new staff position is to be applied
    prospectively to intangible assets acquired after
    December 31, 2008. In addition, FSP

No. 142-3

increases the disclosure requirements related to renewal or
    extension assumptions. The Company will apply the provisions of
    this statement prospectively to business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009 and can
    only assess the impact of the standard once an acquisition is
    consummated.

2.

Adoption
    of New Accounting Standards

Pensions

Effective December 31, 2006, Dover adopted
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”).
    SFAS No. 158 required companies to report the funded
    status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans on their balance sheets as a net liability or
    asset. Upon adoption at December 31, 2006, Dover recorded a
    net reduction to stockholders’ equity of
    $123.5 million, net of tax. In addition, effective for
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, the new
    standard



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

required companies to measure benefit obligations and plan
    assets as of a Company’s fiscal year end (December 31,
    2008 for Dover), using one of the methods prescribed in the
    standard. Dover adopted the new valuation date requirements
    using the

15-month

alternative, as prescribed in the standard, which resulted in a
    charge of approximately $5.8 million, net of tax, to
    retained earnings during the fourth quarter of 2008.

Fair
    Value

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”
    (“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. For financial
    assets and liabilities, this statement was effective for fiscal
    periods beginning after November 15, 2007 and did not
    require any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, FASB
    Staff Position

No. 157-2

was issued which delayed the effective date of FASB Statement
    No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2008 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material
    effect on Dover’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” This statement permits entities to choose to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value. This statement is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
    including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company
    did not elect the fair value option for any of its existing
    financial instruments as of December 31, 2008 and the
    Company has not determined whether or not it will elect this
    option for financial instruments it may acquire in the future.

3.

Acquisitions

All of the Company’s acquisitions have been accounted for
    under SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.”
    Accordingly, the accounts of the acquired companies, after
    adjustments to reflect fair market values assigned to assets and
    liabilities, have been included in the consolidated financial
    statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2008
    acquisitions (see list below) are wholly-owned and had an
    aggregate cost of $103.8 million, net of cash acquired, at
    the date of acquisition. There is no material contingent
    consideration related to the acquisitions at December 31,
    2008. In connection with certain acquisitions, at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had reserves
    related to severance and facility closings of $27.9 million
    and $26.8 million, respectively. During 2008, the Company
    recorded purchase accounting reserves related to acquisitions of
    $5.6 million and paid $4.5 million. The reserves were
    recorded as of the date of acquisition and in accordance with
    the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue

No. 95-3,

“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
    Business Combination.”

For certain acquisitions that occurred in 2008, the Company is
    in the process of obtaining or finalizing appraisals of tangible
    and intangible assets and it is continuing to evaluate the
    initial purchase price allocations, as of the acquisition date,
    which will be adjusted as additional information relative to the
    fair values of the assets and liabilities of the businesses
    becomes known. Accordingly, management has used their best
    estimate in the initial purchase price allocation as of the date
    of these financial statements.

From time to time, the Company will initiate various
    restructuring programs at its operating companies or record
    severance and exit costs in connection with purchase accounting
    for acquisitions (see Note 3 for additional detail). During
    the latter half of 2008, the Company announced plans to increase
    the amount of restructuring efforts in response to the
    significant decline in global economic activity. The Company
    expects further restructuring plans to occur in 2009 resulting
    in costs of approximately $40.0 million. Restructuring
    charges are recorded primarily in Selling and administrative
    expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The

9.

Lines
    of Credit and Debt

During the second quarter ended June 30, 2008, the Company
    repaid its $150 million 6.25% Notes due June 1,
    2008. In addition, on March 14, 2008, Dover issued
    $350 million of 5.45% notes due 2018 and
    $250 million of 6.60% notes due 2038. The net proceeds
    of $594.1 million from the notes were used to repay
    borrowings under Dover’s commercial paper program, and were
    reflected in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
    December 31, 2008. The notes and debentures are redeemable
    at the option of Dover in whole or in part at any time at a
    redemption price that includes a make-whole premium, with
    accrued interest to the redemption date.

During the first quarter of 2008, Dover entered into several
    interest rate swaps in anticipation of the debt financing
    completed on March 14, 2008 which, upon settlement,
    resulted in a net gain of $1.2 million which was deferred
    and will be amortized over the life of the related notes.

There is presently one outstanding swap agreement for a total
    notional amount of $50.0 million, or CHF65.1 million,
    which swaps the U.S. dollar

6-month

LIBOR rate and the Swiss Franc

6-month

LIBOR rate. This agreement hedges a portion of the
    Company’s net investment in

non-U.S. operations

and the fair value outstanding at December 31, 2008 was a
    loss of $12.0 million which was based on quoted market
    prices for similar instruments (uses Level 2 inputs under
    the SFAS No. 157 hierarchy). This hedge is effective.



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company entered into a
    foreign currency hedge which was subsequently settled within the
    quarter. As a result of terminating the hedge, the Company
    recorded a gain of $2.4 million in the third quarter ended
    September 30, 2008.

On November 9, 2007, the Company entered into a
    $1 billion

5-year

unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks
    (the “Credit Agreement”) which replaced a facility
    with substantially similar terms. At the Company’s
    election, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at
    a Eurodollar or Sterling rate based on LIBOR, plus an applicable
    margin ranging from 0.130% to 0.35% (subject to adjustment based
    on the rating accorded the Company’s senior unsecured debt
    by S&P and Moody’s), or at a base rate pursuant to a
    formula defined in the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit
    Agreement requires the Company to pay a facility fee and a
    utilization fee in certain circumstances and imposes various
    restrictions on the Company such as, among other things, the
    requirement for the Company to maintain an interest coverage
    ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less
    than 3.5 to 1. The Company was in compliance with all of its
    debt covenants at December 31, 2008 and had a coverage
    ratio of 13.5 to 1. The Company primarily uses this facility as
    liquidity

back-up

for
    its commercial paper program and has not drawn down any loans
    under the $1 billion facility and does not anticipate doing
    so. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had commercial
    paper outstanding in the principal amount of $191.5 million.

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company closed a
    structured five-year, non-interest bearing, $165.1 million
    amortizing loan with a non-US lender, which also included a
    participation fee received by the Company of $9.9 million.
    The loan was recorded at face value. The Company also expects to
    incur a total of $5.7 million in debt related issuance
    costs over the course of the loan. Beginning in April 2007, the
    repayment schedule requires payments every April and September
    with the final payment to be made in July 2011. The
    participation fee will be amortized ratably into Other Expense
    (income), net over the term of the loan and is recorded in Other
    Deferrals in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The loan agreement
    includes a put and call provision that could have been exercised
    starting in June 2008 though the end of the loan term.

In November 2008, the Canadian Dollar Credit Facility with the
    Bank of Nova Scotia expired. The Company did not renew the
    facility in 2008.

Notes payable shown on the consolidated balance sheets for 2008
    and 2007 principally represented commercial paper issued in the
    U.S. The weighted average interest rate for short-term
    borrowings for the years 2008 and 2007 was 2.4% and 5.1%,
    respectively.

Dover’s long-term debt with a book value of
    $1,892.9 million, of which $32.2 million matures in
    less than one year, had a fair value of approximately
    $2,018.5 million at December 31, 2008. On
    December 31, 2007, the Company’s long-term debt
    instruments had a book value of $1,485.2 million and a fair
    value of approximately $1,496.0 million. The estimated fair
    value of the long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for
    similar issues.

    Equity and Cash Incentive Plan

On April 20, 2004, the stockholders approved the Dover
    Corporation 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2005
    Plan”) to replace the 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan and
    1995 Cash Performance Program (the “1995 Plan”), which

    (non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation
    rights (“SARs”), and restricted stock) to key
    personnel between February 1, 2005 and January 31,
    2015, provided that no incentive stock options shall be granted
    under the plan after February 11, 2014 and a maximum of one
    million shares may be granted as restricted stock. The exercise
    price of options and SARs may not be less than the fair market
    value of the stock at the time the awards are granted. The
    period during which these options and SARs are exercisable is
    fixed by the Company’s Compensation Committee at the time
    of grant, but generally may not commence sooner than three years
    after the date of grant, and may not exceed ten years from the
    date of grant. All stock options or SARs issued under the 1995
    Plan or the 2005 Plan vest after three years of service and
    expire at the end of ten years. All stock options and SARs are
    granted at regularly scheduled quarterly Compensation Committee
    meetings (usually only at the meeting during the first quarter)
    and have an exercise price equal to the closing price of
    Dover’s stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of
    grant. New common shares are issued when options or SARs are
    exercised.

In 2008, the Company issued 2,234,942 SARs under the 2005 Plan.
    No stock options were issued in 2008 and the Company does not
    anticipate issuing stock options in the future. The fair value
    of each grant was estimated on the date of grant using a

Cash received by the Company for stock options exercised during
    the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $70.6 million.

Unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested SARs was
    $18.7 million at December 31, 2008. This cost is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    1.7 years. The fair value of options vested during the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were
    $26.2 million, $28.5 million and $27.2 million,

The Company also has a restricted stock program (as part of the
    2005 Plan), under which common stock of the Company may be
    granted at no cost to certain officers and key employees. In
    general, restrictions limit the sale or transfer of these shares
    during a two or three year period, and restrictions lapse
    proportionately over the two or three year period. The Company
    did not grant any restricted shares in 2008, 2007 or 2006, and
    there are no grants outstanding as of December 31, 2008.

In addition, the Company has a stock compensation plan under
    which non-employee directors are granted shares of Dover’s
    common stock each year as more than half of their compensation
    for serving as directors. During 2008, the Company issued an
    aggregate of 29,213 shares, net, of its common stock to
    twelve outside directors (after withholding 11,582 additional
    shares to satisfy tax obligations) as partial compensation for
    serving as directors of the Company during 2008. During 2007,
    the Company issued an aggregate of 14,129 shares of its
    common stock, net, to twelve outside directors (after
    withholding an aggregate of 6,056 additional shares to satisfy
    tax obligations), as partial compensation for serving as
    directors of the Company during 2007. During 2006, the Company
    issued an aggregate of 11,004 shares, net, of its common
    stock to ten outside directors (after withholding an aggregate
    of 3,958 additional shares to satisfy tax obligations), as
    partial compensation for serving as directors of the Company
    during 2006.

    $65.4 million, respectively, and, as of December 31,
    2007, $48.8 million and $97.0 million, respectively.
    The federal loss carryforwards are available for use against the
    Company’s consolidated federal taxable income and expire in
    2025. The entire balance of the foreign losses is available to
    be carried forward, with $11.4 million of these losses
    beginning to expire during the years 2009 through 2027. The
    remaining $54.0 million of such losses can be carried
    forward indefinitely.

The Company has loss carryforwards for state purposes as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 of $205.3 million and
    $244.2 million, respectively. The state loss carryforwards
    are available for use by the Company between 2009 and 2027.

The Company has foreign tax credit carryforwards of
    $27.9 million and $30.5 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively that are available for use by the
    Company between 2009 and 2014.

The Company has research and development credits of
    $3.9 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $4.1 million at December 31, 2007 that are available
    for use by the Company between 2009 and 2026.



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2008, the Company had available alternative
    minimum tax credits of $3.1 million, which are available
    for use by the Company indefinitely, and alternative minimum tax
    foreign tax credits of $11.7 million that are available for
    use by the Company between 2009 and 2026.

The Company maintains valuation allowances by jurisdiction
    against the deferred tax assets related to certain of these
    carryforwards as utilization of these tax benefits are not
    assured for certain jurisdictions.

The Company has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes
    or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings of its
    international subsidiaries because such earnings are reinvested
    and it is currently intended that they will continue to be
    reinvested indefinitely. At December 31, 2008, the Company
    has not provided for federal income taxes on earnings of
    approximately $669.9 million from its international
    subsidiaries.

In 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized $18.3 million and
    $19.8 million respectively, in tax benefits related to the
    resolution of various state and U.S. income tax issues.
    During 2006, the Company recognized an $11.0 million tax
    benefit, primarily related to the resolution of a state income
    tax issue.

Unrecognized
    Tax Benefits

Effective January 1, 2007, Dover adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48. See Note 2 for additional information on the
    impact of adoption on Dover’s Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Dover files Federal income tax returns, as well as multiple
    state, local and

non-U.S. jurisdiction

tax returns. The Company is no longer subject to examinations of
    its federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”) for years through 2004. All significant state
    and local, and international matters have been concluded for
    years through 1995 and 2000, respectively. With the exception of
    matters in litigation, for which an estimate cannot be made due
    to uncertainties, the Company does not believe it is reasonably
    possible that its unrecognized tax benefits will significantly
    change within the next twelve months.

    2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded potential interest and
    penalty expense of $(0.6) million, $12.9 million and
    $5.0 million, respectively, related to its unrecognized tax
    benefits as a component of provision for income taxes. The
    Company had accrued interest and penalties of $45.9 million

Commitments
    and Contingent Liabilities

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal
    proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites
    identified under Federal and State statutes that provide for the
    allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible
    parties.” In each instance, the extent of the
    Company’s liability appears to be very small in relation to
    the total projected expenditures and the number of other
    “potentially responsible parties” involved and is
    anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few
    of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing
    remedial activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with
    regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been
    established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to
    a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their
    businesses. These proceedings primarily involve claims by
    private parties alleging injury arising out of use of Dover
    company products, exposure to hazardous substances or patent
    infringement, litigation and administrative proceedings
    involving employment matters, and commercial disputes.
    Management and legal counsel periodically review the probable
    outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably
    expected to be incurred, the availability and extent of
    insurance coverage, and established reserves. While it is not
    possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal
    actions or any need for additional reserves, in the opinion of
    management, based on these reviews, it is unlikely that the
    disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned
    above will have a material adverse effect on the financial
    position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive
    position of the Company.

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
    operating leases, many of which contain renewal options. Total
    rental expense, net of insignificant sublease rental income, on
    all operating leases was $76.7 million, $70.5 million
    and $53.9 million for the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Contingent rentals under the
    operating leases were not significant. Aggregate future minimum
    lease payments for operating leases as of December 31, 2008
    are $46.1 million in 2009, $36.2 million in 2010,
    $27.8 million in 2011, $20.9 million in 2012,
    $16.9 million in 2013 and $41.7 million thereafter.

Aggregate future minimum lease payments for capital leases as of
    December 31, 2008 are $2.4 million in 2009,
    $2.3 million in 2010, $2.3 million in 2011,
    $2.1 million in 2012, $1.6 million in 2013 and
    $5.2 million thereafter.

Warranty program claims are provided for at the time of sale.
    Amounts provided for are based on historical costs and adjusted

Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company offers a defined contribution plan to most of its
    employees. The Company also has defined benefit pension plans
    (the “plans”) covering certain employees of Dover and
    its subsidiaries. The plans’ benefits are generally based
    on years of service and employee compensation. The
    Company’s funding policy is consistent with the funding
    requirements of ERISA and applicable international laws. Dover
    adopted SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006 and in
    accordance with the standard Dover used a measurement date of
    December 31st for its pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2008. Prior
    to 2008, Dover used a September 30th measurement date
    for the majority of its defined benefit plans.

The Company is responsible for overseeing the management of the
    investments of the plans’ assets and otherwise ensuring
    that the plans’ investment programs are in compliance with
    ERISA, other relevant legislation, and related plan documents.
    Where relevant, the Company has retained professional investment
    managers to manage the plans’ assets and implement the
    investment process. The investment managers, in implementing
    their investment processes, have the authority and
    responsibility to select appropriate investments in the asset
    classes specified by the terms of their applicable prospectus or
    investment manager agreements with the plans.

The primary financial objective of the plans is to secure
    participant retirement benefits. Accordingly, the key objective
    in the plans’ financial management is to promote stability
    and, to the extent appropriate, growth in the funded status.
    Related and supporting financial objectives are established in
    conjunction with a review of current and projected plan
    financial requirements.

The assets of the plans are invested to achieve an appropriate
    return for the plans consistent with a prudent level of risk.
    The asset return objective is to achieve, as a minimum over
    time, the passively managed return earned by market index funds,
    weighted in the proportions outlined by the asset class
    exposures identified in the plans’ strategic allocation.
    The fair value of the majority of the plans assets were
    determined by the plans’ trustee using quoted market prices
    for identical instruments (considered Level 1 inputs under
    the SFAS No. 157 hierarchy) as of December 31,
    2008. The fair value of various other investments were
    determined by the plans’ trustee using directly observable
    market corroborated inputs, including quoted prices for similar
    assets (considered Level 2 inputs under the
    SFAS No. 157 hierarchy).

The expected return on asset assumption used for pension expense
    was developed through analysis of historical market returns,
    current market conditions and the past experience of plan asset
    investments. In developing the expected return on asset
    assumption, estimates of future market returns by asset category
    are less than actual long-term historical returns in order to
    best anticipate future experience. Overall, it is projected that
    the investment of plan assets will achieve a 7.75% net return
    over time from the asset allocation strategy.

Dover’s discount rate assumption is determined by
    developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds
    with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit
    payment stream. The plans’ expected cash flows are then
    discounted by the resulting

year-by-year

spot rates.

The Company also provides, through non-qualified plans,
    supplemental retirement benefits in excess of qualified plan
    limits imposed by Federal tax law. These plans are supported by
    the general assets of the Company.

Pension cost for all defined contribution, defined benefit, and
    supplemental plans was $81.7 million for 2008,
    $83.6 million for 2007 and $70.4 million for 2006.

For post-retirement benefit measurement purposes, a 9% annual
    rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits
    (i.e., health care cost trend rates) was assumed for 2009. The
    rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5% by the year 2017
    and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend
    rate assumption can have an effect on the amounts reported. For
    example, increasing (decreasing) the assumed health care cost
    trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase
    (decrease) the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as
    of December 31, 2008 by $0.5 million
    ($0.5 million) and would have a negligible impact on the
    net post-retirement benefit cost for 2008.

The post-retirement benefit plans cover approximately 2,019
    participants, approximately 1,177 of whom are eligible for
    medical benefits. The plans are effectively closed to new
    entrants. The post-retirement benefit obligation amounts at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 include approximately
    $4.6 million and $4.4 million in obligations,
    respectively, recorded in discontinued operations.

    Data

Dover identifies its operating segments through the underlying
    management reporting structure related to its operating
    companies and through commonalities related to products,
    processes, distribution

and/or

Revenue is attributed to regions based on the location of the
    Company’s customer, which in some instances is an
    intermediary and not necessarily the end user. Long-lived assets
    are comprised of net property, plant and equipment. The
    Company’s operating companies are based primarily in the
    United States of America and Europe. Dover’s businesses
    serve thousands of customers, none of which accounted for more
    than 10% of consolidated revenue. Accordingly, it is
    impracticable to provide revenue from external customers for
    each product and service sold by segment.

The Company has the authority to issue up to 100,000 shares
    of $100 par value preferred stock and up to
    500,000,000 shares of $1 par value common stock. None
    of the preferred stock has been issued. As of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, 246,615,007 and 244,547,336 shares of common
    stock were issued, respectively. In addition, the Company had
    60,618,384 and 50,508,428 shares in treasury, held at cost,
    as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Share
    Repurchases


During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Board of Directors
    approved a $500 million share repurchase program
    authorizing repurchases of Dover’s common shares through
    the end of 2008. During the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased
    10,000,000 shares of its common stock in the open market at
    an average price of $46.15 per share. As of December 31,
    2008, all shares authorized by the program were purchased.


During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, the Board of
    Directors approved two separate share repurchase programs
    authorizing repurchases of approximately 20,000,000 common
    shares through the end of 2008. The Company entered into an
    accelerated share repurchase agreement on August 2, 2007
    (“ASR”) under which it purchased 6,000,000 shares
    of its common stock at an initial purchase price of $51.64 per
    share. Upon final settlement of this ASR in the fourth quarter
    of 2007, the final economic purchase price was $48.36 per share,
    representing an average of the volume weighted average price of
    the Company’s common stock during the outstanding period
    less a negotiated discount amount. In addition, during 2007, the
    Company made other open market purchases of its common stock
    totaling 6.4 million shares at an average price of $46.78
    per share.

Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31,
    2008 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
    Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
    Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and
    communicated to the Company’s management, including its
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
    appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

During the fourth quarter of 2008, there were no changes in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations Over Internal Controls

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that:

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that the Company’s receipts and
    expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of the Company’s management and
    directors; and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
    on the financial statements.

Management’s report on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the
    Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all
    errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
    are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
    the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
    of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
    of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance
    that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have
    been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those
    internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company has three compensation plans under which equity
    securities of the Company have been authorized for issuance and
    have been issued to employees and to non-employee directors.
    These are the 1995 Incentive Stock



Option Plan and 1995 Cash Performance Program (the “1995
    Plan”), the 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the
    “2005 Plan”) and the 1996 Non-Employee Directors’
    Stock Compensation Plan (the “Directors’ Plan”).
    The information regarding the 2005 Plan and the Directors’
    Plan that is required to be included pursuant to this
    Item 12 is included under the captions “ITEMS TO
    BE VOTED UPON — Proposal 2 — Proposal
    to Approve the Amendments to the 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive
    Plan” and “ITEMS TO BE VOTED UPON —
    Proposal 1 — Election of Directors” and
    “Directors’ Compensation,” respectively, in the
    2009 Proxy Statement and is incorporated in this Item 12 by
    reference. The table above does not reflect shares eligible for
    issuance under the 1996 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock
    Compensation Plan, which does not specify a maximum number of
    shares issuable under it.

The 1995 Plan was adopted in 1995 (replacing the 1984 Plan which
    expired in January 1995) and provided for stock options,
    restricted stock awards and cash performance awards. The 1995
    Plan expired in January 2005, but Column A of the table above
    includes options that remain outstanding under it.

Options granted under the 1995 Plan were all designated as
    non-qualified stock options. The exercise price of options and
    stock appreciations rights (SARs) is the closing price of
    Dover’s stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of
    grant. Options granted under this plan may not be sold,
    transferred, hypothecated, pledged or otherwise disposed of by
    any of the holders except by will or by the laws of descent and
    distribution except that a holder may transfer any non-qualified
    option granted under this plan to members of the holder’s
    immediate family, or to one or more trusts for the benefit of
    such family members, provided that the holder does not receive
    any consideration for the transfer. SARs are not transferable
    except by bequest or inheritance.

The information above summarizes the material aspects of the
    1995 Plan. The rights and obligations of participants are
    determined by the provisions of the plan document itself.
