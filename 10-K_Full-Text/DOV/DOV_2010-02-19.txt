PART 1

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Dover Corporation (“Dover” or the
    “Company”), incorporated in 1947 in the State of
    Delaware, became a publicly traded company in 1955. The Company
    owns and operates a global portfolio of manufacturing companies

Business
    Strategy

The Company operates with certain fundamental business
    strategies. First, it seeks to acquire and own businesses that
    manufacture proprietary engineered industrial products and are
    leaders in four broad markets: Industrial Products, Engineered
    Systems, Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies. To ensure
    success, Dover companies place strong emphasis on new product
    development to better serve customers and expand into new
    product and geographic markets. Second, the Company’s
    businesses are committed to operational excellence, and to being
    market leaders as measured by market share, customer service,
    innovation, profitability and return on invested capital. Third,
    the Company is committed to an operating culture with high
    ethical standards, trust, respect and open communication, to
    allow individual growth and operational effectiveness. Fourth,
    the Company seeks to utilize its strong free cash flow in a
    balanced manner to grow its businesses and to increase
    shareholder value.

Management
    Philosophy

The Company’s operating structure of four defined industry
    segments and six core business platforms within those segments
    drives focused acquisition activity, accelerates opportunities
    to identify and capture operating synergies, including global
    sourcing and supply chain integration, and advances the
    development of the Company’s executive talent. The
    presidents of the Company’s operating companies and groups
    have responsibility for their businesses’ performance as
    they are able to serve customers by focusing closely on their
    products and markets and reacting quickly to customer needs. The
    Company’s segment and executive management set strategic
    direction and initiatives, provide oversight, allocate and
    manage capital, are responsible for major acquisitions and
    provide other services.

In addition, the Company is committed to creating value for its
    customers, employees and shareholders through sustainable
    business practices that protect the environment and the
    development of products that help its customers meet their
    sustainability goals. Dover companies are increasing their focus
    on efficient energy usage, greenhouse gas reduction and waste
    management as they strive to meet the global environmental needs
    of today and tomorrow.

Company
    Goals

The Company is committed to driving shareholder return through
    three key objectives. First, the Company is committed to
    achieving annual sales growth of 7% to 10% which includes 4% to
    5% through-cycle organic growth. The balance of sales growth is
    expected to be achieved from disciplined acquisitions. Secondly,
    the Company continues to focus on margin improvement activities
    and to expand return on invested capital to effectuate earnings
    per share growth ranging from 10% to 13% on an annual basis.
    Lastly, the Company is committed to generating free cash flow as
    a percentage of sales in excess of 10% through disciplined
    capital allocation and active working capital management. The
    Company supports these goals through (1) alignment of
    management compensation with these objectives, (2) a well
    defined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes,
    and (3) talent development programs.

Portfolio
    Development

Acquisitions

The Company’s acquisition program has two elements. First,
    it seeks to acquire value creating add-on businesses that
    broaden its existing companies and their global reach,
    manufacture innovative components and equipment, specialty
    systems

and/or

support services, and sell to industrial or commercial users.
    Second, in the right circumstances, it will strategically pursue
    larger, stand-alone businesses that have the potential to either
    complement its existing companies or allow the Company to pursue
    a new platform. During the period from 2007 through 2009, the
    Company purchased 17 businesses with an aggregate cost of
    $605.8 million.

In 2009, the Company acquired six add-on businesses, for
    aggregate consideration of $228.4 million (including
    $6.4 million of consideration paid in the form of common
    stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Inpro/Seal
    Company). In 2008, the Company acquired four add-on businesses
    for an aggregate cost of $103.8 million, and in 2007, the
    Company acquired seven add-on businesses for an aggregate cost
    of $273.6 million.



For more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past
    two years, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8. The Company’s future growth
    depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful
    businesses, as a substantial number of the Company’s
    current businesses operate in relatively mature markets. While
    the Company expects to generate annual organic growth of
    4% - 5% over a business cycle absent extraordinary economic
    conditions, sustained organic growth at these levels for
    individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each
    year.

Dispositions

While the Company generally expects to hold and integrate
    businesses that it buys, it continually reviews its portfolio to
    verify that those businesses continue to be essential
    contributors to the Company’s long-term growth strategy.
    Occasionally the Company may also make an opportunistic sale of
    one of its companies based on specific market conditions and
    strategic considerations. During the past three years (2007-
    2009), the Company decided to reduce its exposure to small,
    lower margin operations, and, accordingly, it discontinued 7
    operations and sold 10 businesses for an aggregate consideration
    of approximately $187.3 million. For more details, see the
    “Discontinued Operations” discussion below and
    Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8.

    include impairment charges, when necessary, to reduce these
    businesses to estimated fair value. Fair value is determined by
    using directly observable inputs, such as a negotiated selling
    price, or other valuation techniques that use market assumptions
    that are reasonable and supportable. All interim and full year
    reporting periods presented reflect the continuing operations on
    a comparable basis. Please refer to Note 3 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for additional information on discontinued operations.

Raw
    Materials

The Company’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw
    materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished
    components, which are generally available from a number of
    sources. As a result, shortages or the loss of any single
    supplier have not had, and are not likely to have, a material
    impact on operating profits. While the needed raw materials are
    generally available, commodity pricing has trended upward over
    the past few years, particularly for various grades of steel,
    copper, aluminum and select other commodities. The Company has
    generally kept pace with or exceeded raw material cost increases
    using effective pricing strategies. During 2009, the Company
    generally experienced decreases in commodity prices.

Research
    and Development

The Company’s operating companies are encouraged to develop
    new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products
    to satisfy customer needs, expand revenue opportunities
    domestically and internationally, maintain or extend competitive
    advantages, improve product reliability and reduce production
    costs. During 2009, $178.3 million of expense was incurred
    for research and development, including qualified engineering
    costs, compared with $189.2 million and $193.2 million
    in 2008 and 2007, respectively.



Our operating companies in the Product Identification platform
    and Electronic Technologies segment expend significant effort in
    research and development because the rate of product development
    by their customers is often quite high. The companies that
    develop product identification equipment and specialty
    electronic components for the life sciences, datacom and telecom
    commercial markets believe that their customers expect a
    continuing rate of product innovation, performance improvement
    and reduced costs. The result has been that product life cycles
    in these markets generally average less than five years with
    meaningful sales price reductions over that time period.

The Company’s other segments contain many businesses that
    are also involved in important product improvement initiatives.
    These businesses also concentrate on working closely with
    customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and
    market applications, and continuously improving manufacturing
    processes. Most of these businesses experience a much more
    moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is
    generally experienced by the Product Identification platform and
    the Electronic Technologies segment.

Intellectual
    Property and Intangible Assets

The Company owns many patents, trademarks, licenses and other
    forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over a
    number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various
    times over a number of years. A large portion of the
    Company’s intellectual property consists of patents,
    unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting
    trade secrets that the companies seek to protect in various
    ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and
    suppliers where appropriate. In addition, a significant portion
    of the Company’s intangible assets relate to customer
    relationships. While the Company’s intellectual property
    and customer relationships are important to its success, the
    loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships, or
    any group of related rights or relationships, is not likely to
    materially affect the Company on a consolidated basis. The
    Company believes that its companies’ commitment to
    continuous engineering improvements, new product development and
    improved manufacturing techniques, as well as strong sales,
    marketing and service efforts, are significant to their general
    leadership positions in the niche markets that they serve.

Seasonality

In general, Dover companies, while not strongly seasonal, tend
    to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters,
    particularly companies serving the consumer electronics,
    transportation, construction, waste hauling, petroleum,
    commercial refrigeration and food service markets. Companies
    serving the major equipment markets, such as power generation,
    chemical and processing industries, have long lead times geared
    to seasonal, commercial or consumer demands, and tend to delay
    or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with
    those market trends.

Customers

Dover’s companies serve thousands of customers, no one of
    which accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s
    consolidated revenue in 2009.  Similarly, within each of the
    four segments, no customer accounted for more than 10% of that
    segment’s revenue in 2009.

With respect to the Engineered Systems, Fluid Management and
    Industrial Products segments, customer concentrations are quite
    varied. Companies supplying the waste handling, construction,
    agricultural, defense, energy, automotive and commercial
    refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers
    that are significant within those industries. This also tends to
    be true for companies supplying the power generation, aerospace
    and chemical industries. In the other markets served, there is
    usually a much lower concentration of customers, particularly
    where the companies provide a substantial number of products as
    well as services applicable to a broad range of end use
    applications.

Certain companies within the Electronic Technologies segment
    serve the military, space, aerospace, commercial and
    datacom/telecom infrastructure markets. Their customers include
    some of the largest operators in these markets. In addition,
    many of the OEM customers of these companies within the
    Electronic Technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to
    Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) companies.
    Other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid
    manufacturers, many of the largest global EMS companies,
    particularly in China, and major printed circuit board and
    semiconductor manufacturers.



Backlog

Backlog generally is not a significant long-term success factor
    in most of the Company’s businesses, as most of the
    products of Dover companies have relatively short

order-to-delivery

periods. It is more relevant to those businesses that produce
    larger and more sophisticated machines or have long-term
    government contracts, primarily in the Mobile Equipment platform
    within the Industrial Products segment. Total Company backlog as
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $1,083.5 million and
    $1,156.0 million, respectively. This reflects the decrease
    in global economic activity experienced during the latter half
    of 2008, which began to stabilize in the latter half of 2009.

Competition

The Company’s competitive environment is complex because of
    the wide diversity of the products its companies manufacture and
    the markets they serve. In general, most Dover companies are
    market leaders that compete with only a few companies, and the
    key competitive factors are customer service, product quality
    and innovation. Dover companies usually have more significant
    competitors domestically, where their principal markets are,
    than in

non-U.S. markets.

However, Dover companies are becoming increasingly global where
    more competitors exist.

Certain companies in the Electronic Technologies and Engineered
    Systems segments compete globally against a variety of
    companies, primarily operating in Europe and the Far East.

International

For

non-U.S. revenue

and an allocation of the assets of the Company’s continuing
    operations, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Although international operations are subject to certain risks,
    such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and

non-U.S. governmental

restrictions, the Company continues to increase its expansion
    into international markets, including South America, Asia and
    Eastern Europe.

Most of the Company’s

non-U.S. subsidiaries

and affiliates are based in France, Germany, the United Kingdom,
    the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and, with increased
    emphasis, China, Malaysia, India, Mexico, Brazil and Eastern
    Europe.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company believes its companies’ operations generally
    are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations. In a
    few instances, particular plants and businesses have been the
    subject of administrative and legal proceedings with
    governmental agencies or private parties relating to the
    discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances. Where
    necessary, these matters have been addressed with specific
    consent orders to achieve compliance. The Company believes that
    continued compliance will not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial position and will not require
    significant expenditures or adjustments to reserves.

Employees

The Company had approximately 29,300 employees in
    continuing operations as of December 31, 2009, which was a
    decline of approximately 9% from the prior year end, reflecting
    the Company’s restructuring activities in response to an
    overall global economic slowdown.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The Company’s business, financial condition, operating
    results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors
    which could cause its actual results to vary materially from
    recent results or from anticipated future results. In general,
    the Company is subject to the same general risks and
    uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such
    as general economic, industry

and/or

market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural



disasters, and their effect on global energy markets; continued
    events in the Middle East and possible future terrorist threats
    and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws
    or accounting rules. The risk factors discussed in this section
    should be considered together with information included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and should not be considered the only risks facing the Company.

The Company has identified the following specific risks and
    uncertainties that it considers material:

•

The
    Company’s results for 2010 may continue to be impacted
    by current domestic and international economic conditions and
    uncertainties.

In 2010, the Company’s businesses may continue to be
    adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or
    declines in economic activity both domestically and
    internationally in those countries in which the Company
    operates. These circumstances will also impact the
    Company’s suppliers and customers in various ways which
    could have an impact on the Company’s business operations,
    particularly if global credit markets are not operating
    efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce. Such
    negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market
    conditions are beyond the Company’s control, are highly
    unpredictable, and can have an adverse effect on the
    Company’s revenue, earnings, cash flows and cost of capital.

•

Increasing
    price and product/service competition by international and
    domestic competitors, including new entrants and the ability of
    the Company to introduce new and competitive products could
    cause the Company’s businesses to generate lower revenue,
    operating profits and cash flows.

The Company’s competitive environment is complex because of
    the wide diversity of the products that its companies
    manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most Dover
    companies compete with only a few companies. The ability of
    Dover’s companies to compete effectively depends on how
    successfully they anticipate and respond to various competitive
    factors, including new products and services that may be
    introduced by their competitors, changes in customer
    preferences, and pricing pressures. If Dover’s companies
    are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of
    new products and services

and/or

identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or
    successfully introduce new products and services in response to
    such competitive factors, they could lose customers to
    competitors. If Dover’s companies do not compete
    effectively, Dover companies may experience lower revenue,
    operating profits and cash flows.

•

Some
    of Dover’s companies may not anticipate, adapt to, or
    capitalize on technological developments and are subject to the
    cyclical nature of their industries. These factors could cause
    these companies to become less competitive and lead to reduced
    market share, revenue, operating profits and cash
    flows.

Certain Dover companies, particularly in the Electronic
    Technologies segment, sell their products in industries that are
    constantly experiencing change as new technologies are
    developed. In order to grow and remain competitive, the
    companies in these industries must adapt to future changes in
    technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new
    products to address their customers’ changing demands.
    Also, a meaningful portion of the Electronic Technologies
    segment’s revenue is derived from companies that are
    subject to unpredictable short-term business cycles.

The Energy platform in the Fluid Management segment is subject
    to risk due to the volatility of energy prices, although overall
    demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global
    economic conditions and related energy demands. In addition,
    certain Dover businesses manufacture products that are used in
    or related to residential and commercial construction, which can
    be adversely affected by a prolonged downturn in new housing
    starts and other construction markets.

As a result of all the above factors, the revenue and operating
    performance of these companies in any one period are not
    necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating
    performance in other periods, and these factors could have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations, financial position and cash flows.

•

Our companies could lose customers or generate lower
    revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are
    significant increases in the cost of raw materials (including
    energy) or if they are unable to obtain raw materials.

Dover’s companies purchase raw materials, subassemblies and
    components for use in their manufacturing operations, which
    exposes them to volatility in prices for certain commodities.
    Significant price increases for these



commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain
    Dover companies. While the Company’s businesses generally
    attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices
    by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers,
    there may be a time delay between the increased raw material
    prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or
    they may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a
    competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors. In
    addition, while raw materials are generally available now, the
    inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect the
    ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand
    for certain products. Consequently, a significant price increase
    in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss
    of customers and adversely impact revenue, operating profits and
    cash flows.

•

The Company’s growth strategy with respect to
    expansion into new geographic markets could be adversely
    affected if Dover’s companies are unable to manage the
    associated risks, particularly in markets outside the
    U.S.

Approximately 43% of the Company’s revenue is derived
    outside of the United States and the Company continues to focus
    on penetrating new global markets as part of its overall growth
    strategy. This global expansion strategy is subject to general
    risks related to international operations, including, among
    others: political, social and economic instability and
    disruptions; government embargoes or trade restrictions; the
    imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;
    import and export controls; increased compliance costs;
    transportation delays and disruptions; and difficulties in
    staffing and managing multi-national organizations. If the
    Company is unable to successfully mitigate these risks, they
    could have an adverse effect on the Company’s growth
    strategy involving expansion into new geographic markets and on
    its results of operations and financial position.

•

The Company’s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations
    on cross border transactions and the translation of local
    currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact
    the Company’s results of operations.

The Company conducts business through its subsidiaries in many
    different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates
    could have a significant impact on the reported results of
    operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A
    significant and growing portion of the Company’s products
    are manufactured in lower-cost locations and sold in various
    countries. Cross border transactions, both with external parties
    and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to
    foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in
    currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Pound Sterling,
    Chinese RMB (Yuan) and the Canadian dollar, could cause
    fluctuations in the reported results of the Company’s
    operations that could negatively affect its results of
    operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain
    currencies such as the Euro and U.S. dollar potentially
    exposes the Company to competitive threats from lower cost
    producers in other countries such as China. The Company’s
    sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting
    purposes. The weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in
    unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign
    locations are translated into U.S. dollars.

•

The Company’s operating profits and cash flows could
    be adversely affected if the Company cannot achieve projected
    savings and synergies.

The Company is continually evaluating its cost structure and
    seeking ways to capture synergies across its operations. If the
    Company is unable to reduce costs and expenses through its
    various programs, it could adversely affect the Company’s
    operating profits and cash flows.

•

Failure to attract, retain and develop personnel or to
    provide adequate succession plans for key management could have
    an adverse affect on the Company’s operating
    results.

The Company’s growth, profitability and effectiveness in
    conducting its operations and executing its strategic plans
    depend in part on its ability to attract, retain and develop
    qualified personnel, align them with appropriate opportunities
    and maintain adequate succession plans for key management
    positions. If the Company is unsuccessful in these efforts, its
    operating results could be adversely affected.

•

The Company’s businesses and their profitability and
    reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign
    governmental and public policy changes (including environmental
    and employment regulations and tax policies such as export
    subsidy programs, research and experimentation credits, carbon
    emission regulations, and other similar programs), risks
    associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates
    and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.

The Company’s domestic and international sales and
    operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local
    government laws (including environmental and export laws),
    regulations and policies. Failure to comply with any of these
    laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and
    non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage



to the Company’s reputation. In addition, the Company
    cannot provide assurance that its costs of complying with
    current or future laws, including environmental protection,
    employment, and health and safety laws, will not exceed its
    estimates. In addition, the Company has invested in certain
    countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China that carry
    high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic
    risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are
    difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely
    affect the Company’s businesses and reputation.

The Company’s effective tax rate is impacted by changes in
    the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax
    rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets
    or changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other
    taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax
    rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and
    international authorities. If these audits result in assessments
    different from amounts estimated, then the Company’s
    financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax
    adjustments.

•

Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as
    litigation could adversely affect the Company’s financial
    condition.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are, and from time
    to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings
    incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries
    arising out of the use of their products, exposure to hazardous
    substances or patent infringement, employment matters and
    commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require
    significant expenses, divert management’s attention, and
    the Company may be required to pay damages that could adversely
    affect its financial condition. In addition, any insurance or
    indemnification rights that the Company may have may be
    insufficient or unavailable to protect it against potential loss
    exposures.

•

The Company’s revenue, operating profits and cash
    flows could be adversely affected if Dover’s companies are
    unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual
    property rights.

Dover companies own patents, trademarks, licenses and other
    forms of intellectual property related to their products. Dover
    companies employ various measures to maintain and protect their
    intellectual property. These measures may not prevent their
    intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated or
    circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual
    property rights are not highly developed or protected.
    Unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could
    adversely impact the competitive position of Dover’s
    companies and have a negative impact on their revenue, operating
    profits and cash flows.

•

The Company’s growth and results of operations may be
    adversely affected if the Company is unsuccessful in its capital
    allocation and acquisition program or is unable to divest
    non-core assets and businesses as planned.

The Company expects to continue its strategy of seeking to
    acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden its
    existing companies and their global reach as well as, in the
    right circumstances, strategically pursuing larger, stand-alone
    businesses that have the potential to either complement its
    existing companies or allow the Company to pursue a new
    platform. However, there can be no assurance that the Company
    will find suitable businesses to purchase or that the associated
    price would be acceptable. If the Company is unsuccessful in its
    acquisition efforts, then its ability to continue to grow at
    rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected. In
    addition, a completed acquisition may underperform relative to
    expectations, be unable to achieve synergies originally
    anticipated, or require the payment of additional expenses for
    assumed liabilities. Further, failure to allocate capital
    appropriately could also result in over exposure in certain
    markets and geographies. These factors could potentially have an
    adverse impact on the Company’s operating profits and cash
    flows. The inability to dispose of non-core assets and
    businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the
    expected time frame could also have an adverse affect on our
    results of operations.

•

The Company’s borrowing costs are impacted by its
    credit ratings developed by various rating agencies.

Three major ratings agencies (Moody’s, Standard and
    Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings) evaluate the Company’s
    credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high
    ratings for the Company’s long-term debt as of
    December 31, 2009. In February 2010, the Company met
    with Moody’s, Standard Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. All
    agencies reaffirmed their current credit ratings for the
    Company. Although the Company does not anticipate a material
    change in its credit ratings, if the Company’s current
    credit ratings deteriorate, then its borrowing costs could
    increase, including increased fees under the Five-Year Credit
    Facility and the Company’s access to future sources of
    liquidity may be adversely affected.

The facilities are generally well maintained and suitable for

During 2009, the Company had a net reduction of 23 manufacturing
    and warehouse facilities reflecting the Company’s
    restructuring activities in response to the current economic
    climate. These reductions and plant consolidations are not
    expected to restrict the Company’s ability to meet customer
    needs should economic conditions improve materially in 2010.

In November 2009, the Company announced that it would relocate
    its corporate headquarters from New York City to Downers Grove,
    Illinois during the second quarter of 2010 and the relocation is
    anticipated to be completed during the summer. The move will
    essentially consolidate the corporate management team into one
    location which will improve communication and strategic decision
    making and facilitate performance efficiencies.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal
    proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites
    identified under federal and state statutes which provide for
    the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible
    parties.” In each instance, the extent of the
    subsidiary’s liability appears to be very small in relation
    to the total projected expenditures and the number of other
    “potentially responsible parties” involved and it is
    anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few
    of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing
    remedial activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with
    regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been
    established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are, and from time
    to time may become, parties to a number of other legal
    proceedings incidental to their businesses. These proceedings
    primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury
    arising out of the use of products of Dover companies, exposure
    to hazardous substances or patent infringement, employment
    matters and commercial disputes. Management and legal counsel
    periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings,
    the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred, the
    availability and extent of insurance coverage, and established
    reserves. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of
    these legal actions or any need for additional reserves, in the
    opinion of management, based on these reviews, it is unlikely
    that the disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters
    mentioned above will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash
    flows or competitive position.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operation

Special
    Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
    conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes
    which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
    risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results could
    differ materially from those anticipated in these
    forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,
    including those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

particularly in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and in
    “SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS” inside the front cover of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Management assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its
    ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and
    financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity
    are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital
    expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchases
    of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper
    and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term
    capital with satisfactory terms. The Company generates
    substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong
    financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for
    reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions
    while managing its capital structure on a short and long-term
    basis.

Cash and equivalents of $714.4 million at December 31,
    2009, increased by $167.0 million from the prior year
    balance of $547.4 million. Cash and equivalents were
    invested in highly liquid investment grade money market
    instruments with maturity of 90 days or less. Short-term
    investments consist of investment grade time deposits with
    original maturity dates between three months and one year.
    Short-term investments of $223.8 million as of
    December 31, 2009 decreased by $55.7 million from the
    prior year balance of $279.5 million.

The Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investment balance of $938.2 million at December 31,
    2009, includes $813.8 million held outside of the United
    States.

The following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements
    of Cash Flows:

Years Ended December 31,

Cash Flows from Continuing Operations

(560,904

)

Cash flows provided by operating activities for 2009 decreased
    $208.4 million from the prior year primarily reflecting
    lower earnings on reduced sales from continuing operations and
    increased contributions to employee benefit plans partially
    offset by improvements in working capital.

Cash used in investing activities during 2009 decreased
    $195.1 million compared to 2008, largely reflecting reduced
    capital expenditures and net purchases of short-term investments
    partially offset by higher acquisition costs and higher proceeds
    from the sale of a business in 2008. Cash acquisition spending
    was $222.0 million (excluding $6.4 million of
    consideration paid in the form of common stock) during 2009
    compared to $103.8 million in the prior year. Capital
    expenditures during 2009 decreased 31.7% to $120.0 million
    compared to $175.8 million in the prior year due to
    discretionary management spend in response to the economic
    environment. The Company currently anticipates that any
    acquisitions made during 2010 will be funded from available cash
    and internally generated funds, and if necessary, through the
    issuance of commercial paper, use of established lines of credit
    or public debt markets. Capital expenditures during 2010 are
    expected to be approximately 2.3% to 2.5% of revenue.



Cash used in financing activities during 2009 decreased
    $171.0 million compared to the prior year primarily driven
    by the absence of share repurchases versus the prior year and
    reduced proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially
    offset by debt repayments and higher dividend payments in 2009.

Share
    Repurchases

The Company had no share repurchases in 2009. In May 2007, the
    Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
    10,000,000 shares through May 2012. Approximately
    8.9 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under
    this five year authorization as of December 31, 2009.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, pursuant
    to a separate $500 million share repurchase program
    approved by the Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of
    2007, the Company repurchased 10,000,000 shares of its
    common stock in the open market at an average price of $46.15
    per share. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
    completed the purchases of all shares authorized under this
    $500 million share repurchase program.

Adjusted
    Working Capital

Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as
    accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable)
    decreased from the prior year by $183.3 million, or 14.4%,
    to $1,092.6 million which reflected a decrease in
    receivables of $134.4 million, a decrease in net inventory
    of $65.3 million and a decrease in accounts payable of
    $16.4 million, generally due to active working capital
    management in a lower revenue environment. Excluding
    acquisitions, dispositions, and the effects of foreign exchange
    translation of $21.1 million, Adjusted Working Capital
    would have decreased by $246.2 million, or 19.3%.
    “Average Annual Adjusted Working Capital” as a
    percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure calculated as the
    five-quarter average balance of accounts receivable, plus
    inventory, less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve
    months of revenue) increased to 19.9% at December 31, 2009
    from 18.3% at December 31, 2008, and inventory turns were
    6.2 at December 31, 2009 compared to 7.1 at
    December 31, 2008.

In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage
    based upon the operating, investing and financing
    classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows, the Company also measures free cash flow (a non-GAAP
    measure). Management believes that free cash flow is an
    important measure of operating performance because it provides
    management and investors a measurement of cash generated from
    operations that is available to repay debt, pay dividends, fund
    acquisitions and repurchase the Company’s common stock. For
    further information, see Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of
    this Item 7.

Free Cash
    Flow

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2009 was
    $682.1 million or 11.8% of revenue compared to
    $834.6 million or 11.0% of revenue in the prior year. The
    2009 decrease in free cash flow reflects lower earnings from
    continuing operations and higher employee benefit contributions
    partially offset by improvements in working capital and a
    decrease in capital expenditures as compared to the prior year.
    The increase in free cash flow as a percentage of revenue is due
    to active management of adjusted working capital in a lower
    revenue environment.

The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to
    cash flows from operating activities

At December 31, 2009, the Company’s net property,
    plant, and equipment totaled $828.9 million compared to
    $872.1 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in net
    property, plant and equipment reflected depreciation of
    $159.6 million and disposals of $21.7 million,
    partially offset by capital expenditures of $120.0 million,
    acquisitions of $11.6 million and $12.3 million
    related to foreign currency fluctuations.



The aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities decreased from a $240.7 million net liability
    at the beginning of the year to a net liability of
    $222.3 million at year-end 2009. This resulted primarily
    from a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to
    intangible assets and accounts receivable, partially offset by
    an increase in deferred tax assets related to net operating loss
    and other carryforwards.

The Company’s consolidated benefit obligation related to
    defined and supplemental retirement benefits increased by
    $31.0 million in 2009. The increase was due primarily to
    interest costs of $37.6 million, benefits earned of
    $20.2 million, currency changes of $10.3 million,
    business acquisitions of $7.2 million, a net actuarial loss
    of $7.1 million, and other changes, partially offset by
    benefits paid of $54.5 million. In 2009, plan assets
    increased $56.9 million primarily due to Company
    contributions of $77.5 million, investment returns of
    $24.0 million, currency and other changes amounting to
    $7.2 million, partially offset by $54.5 million in
    benefits paid during the year. It is anticipated that the
    Company’s defined and supplemental retirement benefits
    expense will decrease from $36.5 million in 2009 to
    approximately $32.4 million in 2010.

The Company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization
    calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess its overall financial
    leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to
    investors for the same reason. The following table provides a
    reconciliation of net debt to total capitalization to the most
    directly comparable GAAP measures:

The total debt level of $1,860.9 million at
    December 31, 2009 decreased $224.8 million from
    December 31, 2008 due to repayment of commercial paper
    borrowings of $192.8 million and a decrease in long-term
    debt of $32.0 million. Net debt at December 31, 2009
    decreased $336.1 million as a result of the decrease in
    total debt, a decrease in adjusted working capital and the
    absence of share repurchases in 2009.

The Company’s long-term debt instruments had a book value
    of $1,860.9 million on December 31, 2009 and a fair
    value of approximately $1,954.6 million. On
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s long-term debt
    instruments had a book value of $1,892.9 million and a fair
    value of approximately $2,018.5 million.

The Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are
    adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable
    risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future.
    Acquisition spending

and/or

share
    repurchases could potentially increase the Company’s debt.
    However, management anticipates that the net debt to total
    capitalization ratio will remain generally consistent with
    historical levels. Operating cash flow and access to capital
    markets are expected to satisfy the Company’s various cash
    flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital
    expenditures.

Management is not aware of any potential deterioration to the
    Company’s liquidity. Under the Company’s
    $1 billion

5-year

unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks,
    which expires in November 2012, the Company is required to
    maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to consolidated
    net interest expense of not less than 3.5 to 1. The Company was
    in compliance with this covenant and its other long-term debt
    covenants at December 31, 2009 and had a coverage ratio of
    9.1 to 1. It is anticipated that in 2010 any funding
    requirements above cash generated from operations will be met
    through the issuance of commercial paper. Given the current
    economic conditions, the Company fully expects to remain in
    compliance with all of its debt covenants.

The Company periodically enters into financial transactions
    specifically to hedge its exposures to various items, including,
    but not limited to, interest rate and foreign exchange rate
    risk. Through various programs, the



Company hedges its cash flow exposures to foreign exchange rate
    risk by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts and
    collars. The Company does not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative purposes and does not have a
    material portfolio of derivative financial instruments.

The Company’s long-term debt with a book value of $1,860.9
    million includes $35.6 million which matures in less than one
    year and had a fair value of approximately $1,954.6 million at
    December 31, 2009. The estimated fair value of the
    long-term debt is based on quoted market prices, and present
    value techniques used to value similar instruments.

During the second quarter ended June 30, 2008, the Company
    repaid its $150 million 6.25% Notes due June 1,
    2008. In addition, on March 14, 2008, the Company issued
    $350 million of 5.45% Notes due 2018 and
    $250 million of 6.60% Notes due 2038. The net proceeds
    of $594.1 million from the notes were used to repay
    borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program,
    and were reflected in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet at December 31, 2008. The notes and debentures are
    redeemable at the option of the Company in whole or in part at
    any time at a redemption price that includes a make-whole
    premium, with accrued interest to the redemption date.

During the first quarter of 2008, Dover entered into several
    interest rate swaps in anticipation of the debt financing
    completed on March 14, 2008 which, upon settlement,
    resulted in a net gain of $1.2 million which was deferred
    and is being amortized over the lives of the related notes.

There is an outstanding swap agreement for a total notional
    amount of $50.0 million, or CHF65.1 million, which
    swaps the

U.S. 6-month

LIBOR rate and the Swiss Franc

6-month

LIBOR rate. This agreement hedges a portion of the
    Company’s net investment in

non-U.S. operations

and the fair value outstanding at December 31, 2009
    includes a loss of $13.3 million which was based on quoted
    market prices for similar instruments (uses Level 2 inputs
    under the ASC 820 hierarchy). This hedge is effective.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company entered into a
    foreign currency hedge which was subsequently settled within the
    quarter in anticipation of a potential acquisition, which did
    not occur. As a result of terminating the hedge, the Company
    recorded a gain of $2.4 million in the third quarter ended
    September 30, 2008.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had open foreign exchange
    forward purchase contracts expiring through December 2009
    related to cash flow and fair value hedges of foreign currency

Revenue

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 24%
    compared to 2008, due to decreases experienced across all four
    segments primarily driven by a $837.7 million or 34%
    decrease at Industrial Products and a $443.1 million or 26%
    decrease at Fluid Management as a result of lower demand and
    sales volume stemming from general unfavorable economic
    conditions. Revenue decreased at Engineered Systems by
    $148.4 million or 7% due to lower sales volume in core
    businesses which was offset by the incremental revenue from the
    2009 acquisitions. Overall, the Company’s organic revenue
    growth decreased 23.9% with an unfavorable decrease in foreign
    exchange of 1.7% partially offset by a favorable impact of 1.9%
    in net growth from acquisitions. Gross profit decreased 23% to
    $2,099.1 million from 2008 while the gross profit margin
    remained essentially flat at 36.3% and 36.1%, in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Selling
    and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses of $1,511.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $189.6 million over
    the comparable 2008 period, primarily due to decreased revenue
    activity, cost curtailment efforts and integration programs
    partially offset by restructuring charges. Selling and
    administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to
    26% from 22% in the prior year reflecting reduced revenue levels
    and restructuring charges of $50.2 million.

Interest
    Expense, net

Interest expense, net, increased 5% to $100.4 million for
    2009, compared to $96.0 million for 2008 primarily due to
    lower average outstanding commercial paper balances during the
    period more than offset by cash and investments that were
    reinvested at lower interest rates during the later part of the
    year. Interest expense for the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008 was $116.2 million and $130.2 million,
    respectively. Interest income for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $15.8 million and
    $34.2 million, respectively.

Other
    Expense (Income), net

Other expense (income), net for 2009 and 2008 of
    ($4.0) million and ($12.7) million, respectively, was
    driven primarily related to the effect of foreign exchange
    fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies
    other the Company’s functional currency.

Income
    Taxes

The effective tax rates for continuing operations for 2009 was
    24.4% compared to the prior year rate of 26.6%. The effective
    tax rate for 2009 was improved by $31.6 million of net
    benefits recognized for tax positions that were effectively
    settled primarily in the second and fourth quarters of 2009. The
    effective tax rate for 2008 was favorably impacted by
    $26.3 million of net benefits recognized for tax positions
    that were primarily settled in the third and fourth quarters of
    2008. The full year 2009 rate reflects the favorable impact of
    benefits recognized for tax positions that were effectively
    settled and the favorable impact of a higher percentage of
    non-U.S. earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions.

Net
    Earnings

Net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009
    were $356.4 million or $1.91 dilutive earnings per share
    (“EPS”) including a loss from discontinued operations
    of $15.5 million or $0.08 EPS, compared to net earnings of
    $590.8 million or $3.12 dilutive EPS for the same period of
    2008, including a loss from discontinued operations of
    $103.9 million or $0.55 EPS. The losses from discontinued
    operations in 2009 include approximately $10.3 million, net
    of tax, related to a write-down of a business held for sale. The
    losses from discontinued operations in 2008 largely reflect a
    loss provision for a business held for sale, as well as tax
    expenses and tax accruals related to ongoing Federal tax
    settlements and state tax assessments. Refer to Note 3 in
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
    on discontinued operations.

In addition to these factors, earnings across all platforms were
    also negatively impacted by restructuring charges as noted
    below, partially offset by benefits captured from business
    restructuring and integration programs completed to date.



Severance
    and Exit Reserves

The Company’s synergy capture programs and the
    restructuring initiatives launched during 2008, were continued
    throughout 2009. The Company was able to respond to the economic
    downturn through strategic restructuring efforts undertaken by
    management which yielded savings of approximately
    $125 million in 2009. The 2010 benefits from these
    restructuring efforts are expected to range from
    $30 million to $40 million. During 2009, the Company
    had a net reduction in its workforce of approximately 2,950, or
    9%, and a net reduction of 23 manufacturing and warehouse
    facilities. The Company does not anticipate a significant
    reduction to its workforce in 2010 and will continue to monitor
    business activity across its markets served and adjust capacity
    as necessary pending the economic climate.

From time to time, the Company has initiated various
    restructuring programs at its operating companies as noted above
    and has recorded severance and other restructuring costs in
    connection with purchase accounting for acquisitions prior to
    January 1, 2009.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had reserves
    related to severance and other restructuring activities of $16.8
    million and $31.0 million, respectively. During 2009, the
    Company recorded $72.1 million in additional charges and made
    $66.8 million in payments and $19.5  million of non-cash
    write-downs related to reserve balances. For 2009, approximately
    $21.9 million and $50.2 million of restructuring charges
    were recorded in cost of goods and services and selling and
    administrative expenses, respectively, in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. During 2008, the Company recorded
    $27.4 million in additional charges and $5.6 million
    in purchase accounting reserves related to acquisitions,
    partially offset by other non-cash write-downs of
    $2.3 million and payments of $28.1 million.

Current
    Economic Environment

With few exceptions, the Company experienced lower demand across
    all of its end markets resulting in lower bookings and backlog
    in the fourth quarter of 2008 through the first half of 2009,
    with modest improvements in certain segments in the second half
    of 2009. Although this downturn had a significant adverse impact
    on revenue and earnings for the year, the Company maintained
    double-digit margin levels and generated free cash flow in
    excess of 10% as a percentage of revenue. The structural changes
    made over the last few years, becoming less dependent on capital
    goods markets and having greater recurring revenue, together
    with improved working capital management and strong pricing
    discipline partially offset the impact of the economic downturn
    during 2009. As discussed above in the Liquidity and Capital
    Resources section, the Company believes that existing sources of
    liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at
    comparable risk-based interest rates.

    Outlook

The Company estimates full year organic growth to be in the
    range of 4% to 6% (inclusive of a foreign currency impact of 1%)
    and acquisition related growth to be around 3% for transactions
    completed in 2009. Based on these revenue assumptions and
    profitability expectations, the Company has projected that its
    diluted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in
    the range of $2.35 to $2.65 and expects its earnings to follow a
    traditional seasonal pattern of being higher in the second and
    third quarters. The Company also remains focused on key
    initiatives including the corporate development program, post
    merger integration process and supply chain initiative among
    others.

Industrial Products revenue and earnings decreased by 34% and
    53%, respectively, as compared to the prior year primarily due
    to general economic conditions as well as the continued downturn
    in infrastructure, energy, and transportation markets. The
    segment decline in revenue primarily reflected a core business
    decrease of 33% and an unfavorable impact of 1.0% due to foreign
    exchange. Earnings and margin were impacted by decreased revenue
    and $17.5 million in restructuring charges. The segment has
    experienced modest improvement in commercial activity across
    markets served during the fourth quarter of 2009.

Material Handling revenue and earnings decreased 42% and 73%,
    respectively, when compared to the prior year. The platform
    experienced significant challenges in its core infrastructure,
    automotive, construction equipment and energy markets which were
    partially offset by an increase in military demand. The decrease
    in revenue coupled with restructuring charges of
    $11.0 million negatively impacted earnings. Although
    bookings are down 47% as compared to 2008, the platforms served
    end markets have stabilized in the fourth quarter.

Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings decreased 27% and 29%,
    respectively, over the prior year. The strength of the military
    market during the year was offset by challenges in the energy,
    bulk transport and vehicle service markets. Earnings at the
    platform were primarily impacted by lower revenue and
    restructuring charges of $6.5 million.

Engineered Systems revenue and earnings decreased by 7% and 18%,
    respectively, as compared to the prior year. The decline in
    revenue was primarily driven by an 11% decline in core business
    revenue (excluding acquisitions) as a result of general softness
    in the markets served by the segment and an unfavorable impact
    of foreign exchange of 3%. The acquisitions of Tyler, Ala Cart,
    Inc. and Barker Company in the Engineered Products platform and
    Extech Instruments in the Product Identification platform
    accounted for 7% revenue growth. The earnings decline was
    substantially driven by the softness in most end markets served,
    $18.4 million of restructuring charges and
    $6.2 million of acquisition related expenses.

Engineered Products revenue and earnings decreased by 2% and
    10%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Lower sales
    volume throughout our core businesses (most notably
    refrigeration equipment) were partially offset by acquisition
    revenue. The earnings decline resulted from lower sales volume
    in commercial cooling, HVAC and packaging equipment,
    restructuring charges of $6.9 million and $6.2 million
    of acquisition related expenses.

Product Identification platform revenue and earnings declined
    13% and 18%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Core
    revenue decreased 10% due to lower sales volume in the Direct
    Marketing and Bar Coding business with the balance of the
    revenue decline due to foreign exchange. The platform incurred
    $11.5 million in restructuring charges during the year.

Fluid Management’s revenue and earnings decreased by 26%
    and 33%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. The
    decline in revenue was primarily driven by a 25% decline in core
    business revenue and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange
    of 2%. The decline in revenue was partially offset by the full
    year effect of 2008 acquisitions and a 2009 acquisition (1%).
    The earnings decline was driven by reduced revenue,
    $9.7 million in restructuring charges and acquisition
    related expenses of $2.5 million.

The Energy platform’s revenue and earnings decreased 33%
    and 38%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. The
    decline in revenue is a result of lower demand in the oil, gas
    and power generation industries, partially offset by the impact
    of 2008 and 2009 acquisitions. The platform has experienced a
    recent increase in revenue growth stemming from increases in
    active North American drilling rigs. The decrease in earnings is
    a result of lower sales volume, restructuring charges of
    $3.0 million and acquisition related expenses of
    $2.5 million, partially offset by operational improvements
    and cost savings as a result of restructuring activities.
    Waukesha Bearings acquired Inpro/Seal Company on
    December 30, 2009 which accounted for the majority of the
    acquisition costs.

The Fluid Solutions platform revenue and earnings decreased 17%
    and 20%, respectively, as compared to the prior year due to
    lower demand in the their various industrial markets. Decreased
    earnings reflect lower sales volume and $6.7 million of
    restructuring charges.

Electronic Technologies revenue and earnings decreased 26% and
    57%, respectively, as compared to the prior year primarily
    driven by weak demand for telecom components and electronic
    assembly and test equipment. The decline in core revenue was 24%
    and there was a 2% unfavorable impact on revenue from foreign
    exchange. Micro Electronic Mechanical Systems (“MEMS”)
    products continue to show increased customer adoption, while
    military and space programs continue to provide a constructive
    business climate for our electronic component companies.
    Earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were
    negatively impacted by lower sales volume and $26.6 million
    of restructuring charges. In addition, the comparability of 2009
    earnings is impacted by the favorable impact of 2008 earnings,
    which included a $7.5 million gain on the sale of a
    business (semi-conductor test handling).

Revenue

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 3%
    over 2007, due to increases of $232.0 million at Fluid
    Management, $52.2 million at Industrial Products and
    $6.0 million at Electronic Technologies. These revenue
    increases were due to positive market fundamentals and
    acquisitions at Fluid Management, while Engineered Systems’
    revenue decreased $41.7 million due to weakness in markets
    served by the Engineered Products platform. Overall,
    Dover’s organic revenue growth was 1%, net acquisition
    growth was 1% and the impact from foreign exchange was 1%. Gross
    profit increased 4% to $2,730.0 million from 2007 while the
    gross profit margin remained essentially flat at 36.1% and
    35.8%, in 2008 and 2007, respectively.



Selling
    and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses of $1,700.7 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 increased
    $86.7 million over the comparable 2007 period, primarily
    due to increased revenue activity, increased professional fees
    and restructuring charges.

Interest
    Expense, net

Interest expense, net, increased 7% to $96.0 million for
    2008, compared to $89.6 million for 2007. The increase was
    due to higher average outstanding borrowings used to fund
    purchases of the Company’s common stock and higher average
    commercial paper rates.

Other
    Expense (Income), net

Other expense (income), net for 2008 and 2007 of
    ($12.7) million and $3.5 million, respectively, was
    driven primarily by foreign exchange gains and losses, partially
    offset by other miscellaneous income.

Income
    Taxes

The 2008 and 2007 tax rate for continuing operations was 26.6%
    in both periods, each favorably impacted by the mix of

non-U.S. earnings

in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions.

Net
    Earnings

Net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008
    were $590.8 million or $3.12 EPS, which included a loss
    from discontinued operations of $103.9 million or $0.55
    EPS, compared to net earnings of $661.1 million or $3.26
    EPS for the same period of 2007, including a loss from
    discontinued operations of $8.7 million or $0.04 EPS. The
    losses from discontinued operations in 2008 largely reflect a
    loss provision for a business expected to be sold in 2009, as
    well as tax expenses and tax accruals related to ongoing Federal
    tax settlements and state tax assessments. Refer to Note 3
    in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    information on discontinued operations.

Industrial Products increase in revenue over the prior year was
    primarily due to strength in the military and solid waste
    management markets as well as the impact of the December 2007
    acquisition of Industrial Motion Control LLC (“IMC”),
    and the March 2008 acquisition of Lantec Winch and Gear Inc.
    Overall, the segment had 2% revenue growth from its core
    businesses and acquisition growth of 3%, which was partially
    offset by the sale of a line of business. Earnings declined 4%
    when compared to the prior year substantially due to weakness in
    the construction and the North American auto service markets,
    and restructuring costs.

Material Handling revenue decreased 1% while earnings decreased
    5% when compared to the prior year. Revenue and earnings growth
    in the industrial winch business was more than offset by
    softness in the infrastructure, industrial automation and
    automotive markets. In addition, the platform incurred
    additional expenses related to its ongoing cost reduction and
    integration activities.

Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings increased 5% and 2%,
    respectively, over the prior year. The revenue increase was
    primarily due to core business growth as the platform continued
    to experience strength in the aerospace, military and solid
    waste management markets. Softness in the automotive service and
    bulk transport end markets partially offset the increases
    experienced in other markets.

Engineered Systems decreases in revenue and earnings over the
    prior year of 2% and 5%, respectively, were primarily driven by
    the Engineered Products platform. Overall, the segment had a 4%
    decline in revenue from its core businesses which was partially
    offset by the favorable impact of currency rates of 2%.

Engineered Products revenue and earnings decreased 5% and 15%,
    respectively, over the prior year due to weaker sales of retail
    food equipment and softness in the beverage can equipment
    business. In addition to the reduction in overall sales volume
    during the year, the platform’s earnings were negatively
    impacted by currency exchange rates, restructuring and a
    $6.6 million one-time charge primarily related to
    inventory. Partially offsetting these declines were the results
    of the heat exchanger and foodservice businesses which
    experienced continued strength throughout 2008.

Product Identification platform revenue and earnings both
    increased 1% over 2007. The revenue growth was primarily due to
    the favorable impact of foreign exchange as the core businesses
    in the platform experienced lower volume. Despite the decline in
    core business revenue, the platform was able to maintain margins
    consistent with the prior year due to on-going integration
    activities across the platform.

Fluid Management revenue and earnings increased 16% and 27%,
    respectively, over 2007 due to strength in the oil, gas, and
    power generation sectors served by the Energy platform as well
    as the diverse markets served by the Fluid Solutions platform.
    Overall, the segment had organic revenue growth of 12%,
    acquisition growth of 3%, with the remainder due to the
    favorable impact of foreign exchange.

The Energy platform’s revenue increased 21% while its
    earnings improved 32%, when compared to 2007, due to strength in
    the oil and gas markets and increasing power generation demand.
    Earnings and margin benefited from the higher volume and
    operational improvements.

The Fluid Solutions platform revenue increased 10% and earnings
    improved 20% due to acquisitions and strength in the markets
    served by its core businesses. In general, demand remained
    strong for pumps, dispensing systems, and connectors. Earnings
    and margins improved due to a favorable business mix and cost
    savings from the platform’s ongoing cost reduction
    activities.

Electronic Technologies revenue was flat while earnings
    increased 7% when compared to the prior year. Revenue increases
    in the micro-acoustic component business were offset by a
    softening in the other markets served by the segment resulting
    in a 3% decline in core business revenue, excluding favorable
    foreign exchange rates. The segment’s earnings benefited
    from the increased volume in the micro-acoustic component
    business, a $7.5 million gain from the sale of a line of
    business (semi-conductor test handling), and cost savings from
    restructuring activities that were implemented in the first
    quarter of 2008.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The Company’s consolidated financial statements and related
    public financial information are based on the application of
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates,
    assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of
    accounting principles that have an impact on the assets,
    liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These
    estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in
    the public disclosures of the Company, including information
    regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The
    Company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting
    assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied.
    Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on
    a consistent basis throughout the Company. The Company believes
    that its significant accounting policies are primary areas where
    the financial information of the Company is subject to the use
    of estimates, assumptions and the application of judgement which
    include the following areas:

•

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances
    are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, b) price is fixed or determinable,
    c) collectibility is reasonably assured, and
    d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where
    installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the
    installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of
    the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving
    non-essential installation obligations are those which can
    generally be completed in a short period of time at
    insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these
    installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases
    can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the
    installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the
    delivered product, then revenue recognition is deferred until
    installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined
    that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the
    Company will allocate consideration received to the separate
    deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize
    revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable
    identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other
    post shipment obligations such as training and customer
    acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is
    deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance
    has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned
    when services are performed. Revenues associated with
    construction type contracts are recorded using the

percentage-of-completion

method. The Company recognizes contract revenue under percentage
    of completion accounting using the cost to cost method measure
    of progress. The application of percentage of completion
    accounting requires estimates of future revenues and contract
    costs over the full term of the contract. The Company updates
    project cost estimates on a quarterly basis or more frequently
    when changes in circumstances warrant.



•

Inventory for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries,
    including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the
    lower of cost, determined on the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is
    stated at cost, determined on the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under
    certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the
    valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly
    value inventory. The Electronic Technologies companies tend to
    experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value
    fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of
    product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time.

•

Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves
    at an operation, in accordance with appropriate accounting
    principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs,
    require the use of estimates. Though the Company believes that
    these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual
    results may be different than the estimated amounts.

•

The Company has significant tangible and intangible assets on
    its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles
    related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of
    these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and
    amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of
    estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established
    accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant
    use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to
    the identification of reporting units and the determination of
    fair market value. The Company’s assets and reporting units
    are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during
    the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist, such
    as a significant sustained change in the business climate,
    during the interim periods. The Company believes that its use of
    estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business
    conditions could potentially require adjustments to the
    valuations.

•

The valuation of the Company’s pension and other
    post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and
    estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of
    expenses and assets/liabilities. Inherent in these valuations
    are key assumptions, including discount rates, investment
    returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality
    rates. The actuarial assumptions used in the Company’s
    pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with
    external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for
    the Company’s future pension obligations. Changes in
    assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have
    a material impact on the Company’s pension expenses and
    related funding requirements. The Company’s expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually
    based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio
    allocation. The Company’s discount rate assumption is
    determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality
    corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’
    expected benefit payment streams. The plans’ expected cash
    flows are then discounted by the resulting

year-by-year

spot rates.

•

The Company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that
    are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These
    assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income
    streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are
    also estimated, using a more likely than not criteria, for
    ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues
    that are currently unresolved. The Company routinely monitors
    the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is
    properly reserved. Valuations related to tax accruals and assets
    can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in
    tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and the
    Company’s future taxable income levels. The provisions for
    uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken
    or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure
    requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions.
    The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit
    that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement. The Company records interest and
    penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of
    provision for income taxes.

•

The Company has significant accruals and reserves related to the
    self-insured portion of its risk management program. These
    accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard
    to risk exposure and ultimate liability. The Company estimates
    losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, the
    Company’s experience and relevant industry data. The
    Company reviews these factors quarterly and considers the



current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to
    current market conditions and Company experience.

•

The Company has established reserves for environmental and legal
    contingencies at both the operating company and corporate
    levels. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is
    required to quantify the Company’s ultimate exposure in
    these matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is
    reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate
    levels to ensure that the Company is properly reserved. Reserve
    balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances
    for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves
    for emerging issues. While the Company believes that the current
    level of reserves is adequate, future changes in circumstances
    could impact these determinations.

•

The Company from time to time will discontinue certain
    operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if
    necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations
    to their estimated fair market value. These estimates include
    assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of
    the sale. The adjustments to fair market value of these
    operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold.
    Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an
    operation could potentially require future adjustments to these
    estimates.

•

The Company is required to recognize in its consolidated
    statements of operations the expense associated with all share
    based payment awards made to employees and directors, including
    stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted
    stock and performance share awards. The Company uses the
    Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of its
    SARs, and stock options that are granted to employees. The model
    requires management to estimate the expected life of the SAR or
    option, expected forfeitures and the volatility of the
    Company’s stock using historical data. The Company uses the
    Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of
    performance share awards which also requires management to
    estimate the volatility of its stock and the volatility of
    returns on the stock of its peer group as well as the
    correlation of the returns between the companies in the peer
    group. For additional information related to the assumptions
    used, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Adoption
    of New Accounting Standards


In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under
    ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), which
    retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method
    of accounting (the purchase method) be used for all business
    combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each
    business combination. In general, the statement 1) extends
    its applicability to all events where one entity obtains control
    over one or more other businesses, 2) broadens the use of
    fair value measurements used to recognize the assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed, 3) changes the accounting for
    acquisition related fees and restructuring costs incurred in
    connection with an acquisition, and 4) increases required
    disclosures. The Company has applied the provisions of this
    guidance prospectively to business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact
    of these provisions did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements since its
    adoption.

In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC
    805 for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent
    measurement and accounting, and disclosures for assets and
    liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations.
    ASC 805 eliminates the distinction between contractual and
    non-contractual contingencies. The Company has applied the
    provisions of this guidance prospectively to business
    combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after
    January 1, 2009. The impact of these provisions did not
    have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements since its adoption.



In April 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC
    350, Goodwill and Other Intangibles (“ASC 350”) and
    ASC 275, Risks and Uncertainties (“ASC 275”), to
    improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized
    intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to
    measure the fair value of the intangible asset. ASC 350 and ASC
    275 amend the factors to be considered when developing renewal
    or extension assumptions that are used to estimate an intangible
    asset’s useful life. The guidance is to be applied
    prospectively to intangible assets acquired after
    December 31, 2008. In addition, ASC 350 and ASC 275
    increase the disclosure requirements related to renewal or
    extension assumptions. The Company has applied the provisions of
    this guidance to business combinations for which the acquisition
    date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact of ASC 350
    and ASC 275 did not have a material effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements since its adoption.

In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under
    ASC 715, Compensation — Retirement Benefits (“ASC
    715”) which amends the disclosure requirements about plan
    assets of a defined pension or other postretirement plan. The
    provisions of this guidance require disclosure of 1) how
    investment allocation decisions are made, including factors that
    are pertinent to an understanding of the investment policies and
    strategies, 2) the fair value of each major category of
    plan assets, 3) the inputs and valuation techniques used to
    determine fair value and 4) an understanding of significant
    concentration of risk in plan assets. The provisions of this
    guidance become effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2009 and are to be applied prospectively. The
    adoption of the amendments under ASC 715 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC
    855, Subsequent Events (“ASC 855”) which establishes
    general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events
    that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
    statements are issued or are available to be issued. ASC 855
    became effective for interim or annual financial periods ending
    after June 15, 2009 and was adopted in the second quarter
    of 2009. The adoption of ASC 855 did not have a material effect
    on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC
    105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“ASC
    105”), which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification (“Codification”) as the source of
    authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be
    applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
    accounting principles. ASC 105 became effective for financial
    statements issued for interim periods ended after
    September 15, 2009. All content within the Codification
    carries the same level of authority. The adoption of ASC 105 did
    not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC
    825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”) to require
    disclosures about fair value of financial instruments not
    measured on the balance sheet at fair value in interim financial
    statements as well as in annual financial statements. The
    provisions of this guidance require all entities to disclose the
    methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair
    value of financial instruments. ASC 825 became effective for
    interim periods ended after June 15, 2009 and does not
    require comparative disclosure for earlier periods presented
    upon initial adoption. The adoption of ASC 825 did not have a
    material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.


Effective December 31, 2006, the Company applied certain
    provisions of ASC 715 which required companies to report the
    funded status of their defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans on their balance sheets as a net
    liability or asset. Upon adoption at December 31, 2006, the
    Company recorded a net reduction to shareholders’ equity of
    $123.5 million, net of tax. In addition, effective for
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, the new
    standard required companies to measure benefit obligations and
    plan assets as of a Company’s fiscal year end
    (December 31, 2008 for the Company), using one of the
    methods prescribed in the standard. The Company adopted the new
    valuation date requirements using the

15-month

alternative, as prescribed in the standard, which resulted in a
    charge of approximately $5.8 million, net of tax, to
    retained earnings during the fourth quarter of 2008.

In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under
    ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC
    820”) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair
    value measurements. For financial assets and liabilities, this
    guidance was effective for fiscal periods beginning after
    November 15, 2007 and did not require any new fair value
    measurements. The



adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2008 did not have a
    material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective
    date for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2008, except for items that
    are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The
    adoption of the provisions of ASC 820 related to
    “non-financial assets” did not have a material effect
    on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under
    ASC 825 which permits entities to choose to measure many
    financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.
    This statement became effective for financial statements issued
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
    including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company
    did not elect the fair value option for any of its existing
    financial instruments as of December 31, 2008 and the
    Company has not determined whether or not it will elect this
    option for financial instruments it may acquire in the future.


Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted certain
    provisions under ASC 740, Income Taxes
    (“ASC 740”) which specifies the way companies are
    to account for uncertainty in income tax reporting, and
    prescribes a methodology for recognizing, reversing and
    measuring the tax benefits of a tax position taken, or expected
    to be taken, in a tax return. As a result of adopting the new
    standard, the Company recorded a $58.2 million increase to
    reserves as a “cumulative effect” decrease to opening
    retained earnings as of January 1, 2007, of which
    $53.4 million was included in continuing operations.
    Including this “cumulative effect” adjustment, the
    Company had unrecognized tax benefits, net of indirect benefits
    and deposits, of $190.5 million at January 1, 2007, of
    which $35.4 million related to accrued interest and
    penalties. The portion of the unrecognized tax benefits at
    January 1, 2007 included in continuing operations totaled
    $147.6 million, of which $28.0 million related to
    accrued interest and penalties.

Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information
    regarding the Company’s results as determined by generally
    accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company also
    discloses non-GAAP information which management believes
    provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net
    debt, total debt, total capitalization, adjusted working
    capital, average annual adjusted working capital, revenues
    excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures
    under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash
    flows from operating activities, debt or equity, revenue and
    working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they
    may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by
    other companies. Management believes the (1) net debt to
    total capitalization ratio and (2) free cash flow are
    important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net
    debt to total capitalization is helpful in evaluating the
    Company’s capital structure and the amount of leverage it
    employs. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a
    measurement of cash generated from operations that is available
    to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase
    the Company’s common stock. Reconciliations of free cash
    flow, total debt and net debt can be found above in this
    Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Management
    believes that reporting adjusted working capital (also sometimes
    called “working capital”), which is calculated as
    accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable,
    provides a meaningful measure of the Company’s operational
    results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue.
    Management believes that reporting adjusted working capital and
    revenues at constant currency, which excludes the positive or
    negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates, provides a meaningful measure of the Company’s
    operational changes, given the global nature of Dover’s
    businesses. Management believes that reporting organic revenue
    growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange
    rates and the impact of acquisitions, provides a useful
    comparison of the Company’s revenue performance and trends
    between periods.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rates

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in
    interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of long-term
    fixed interest rate debt, interest rate swaps attached thereto,
    commercial paper borrowings and investments in cash equivalents.
    Generally, the fair market value of fixed-interest rate debt
    will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest
    rates rise.

•

A 54 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates
    (10% of the Company’s weighted average long-term debt
    interest rate) would have an immaterial effect on the fair value
    of the Company’s long-term debt.

•

Commercial paper borrowings are at variable interest rates, and
    have maturities of three months or less. A 25 basis point
    increase or decrease in the interest rates (100% of the
    Company’s weighted average commercial paper interest rate)
    on commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial impact
    on the Company’s pre-tax earnings.

•

All highly liquid investments, including highly liquid debt
    instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months
    or less, are considered cash equivalents. The Company places its
    investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers
    and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer. It has been
    determined that a 10% fluctuation of the Company’s weighted
    average interest rate would have an immaterial impact on the
    Company’s pre-tax earnings.

•

Short-term investments consist of bank term deposits that have
    maturity dates that range from six to nine months. It has been
    determined that a 10% fluctuation of the Company’s weighted
    average interest rate would have an immaterial impact on the
    Company’s pre-tax earnings.

•

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had two interest rate
    swaps outstanding, as discussed in Note 9 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not enter
    into derivative financial or derivative commodity instruments
    for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign
    Exchange

The Company conducts business in various

non-U.S. countries,

primarily in Canada, Mexico, substantially all of the European
    countries, Brazil, Argentina, Malaysia, China, India and other
    Asian countries. Therefore, changes in the value of the
    currencies of these countries affect the Company’s
    financial position and cash flows when translated into
    U.S. Dollars. The Company has generally accepted the
    exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment
    in

non-U.S. operations.

The Company may, from time to time, for a specific exposure,
    enter into fair value hedges. Certain individual operating
    companies that have foreign exchange exposure have established
    formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair
    value

and/or

cash flow hedging. The Company has mitigated and will continue
    to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation
    of

non-U.S. operating

companies in which the majority of all costs are local-currency
    based. A change of 5% or less in the value of all foreign
    currencies would not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position and cash flows.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

.

Based on its assessment under the criteria set forth in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

,
    management concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP.

In making its assessment of internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, management has excluded
    those companies acquired in purchase business combinations
    during 2009, which included Tyler Refrigeration, Mechanical
    Field Services, Ala Cart, Inc., Barker Company, Extech
    Instruments, and Inpro/Seal Company. These companies are
    wholly-owned by the Company and their total revenue for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 represents approximately 2.3% of
    the Company’s consolidated total revenue for the same
    period and their assets represent approximately 3.1% of the
    Company’s consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report
    which appears herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Dover Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of Dover Corporation and its subsidiaries
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009 based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in “Management’s Report
    on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” appearing
    under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
    these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule,
    and on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
    audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
    material misstatement and whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain income tax positions in 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



As described in “Management’s Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting,” management has excluded
    Tyler Refrigeration, Mechanical Field Services LP., Ala Cart,
    Inc. Barker Company, Extech Instruments and Inpro/Seal Company
    from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2009 because they were acquired by the
    Company in purchase business combinations during 2009. We have
    also excluded Tyler Refrigeration, Mechanical Field Services
    LP., Ala Cart, Inc., Barker Company, Extech Instruments and
    Inpro/Seal Company from our audit of internal control over
    financial reporting. These companies are wholly owned by the
    Company and their total assets and revenue represent
    approximately 3.1% and 2.3%, respectively, of the related
    consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year
    ended December 31, 2009.

Description
    of Business

Description
    of Business

Dover Corporation (the “Company”) is a diversified,
    multinational manufacturing corporation comprised of operating
    companies that manufacture a broad range of specialized
    industrial products and components as well as related services
    and consumables. The Company also provides engineering, testing
    and other similar services, which are not significant in
    relation to consolidated revenue. The Company’s operating
    companies are based primarily in the United States of America
    and Europe with manufacturing and other operations throughout
    the world. The Company reports its results in four segments,
    Industrial Products, Engineered Systems, Fluid Management and
    Electronic Technologies. For additional information on the
    Company’s segments, see Note 14.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
    The results of operations of purchased businesses are included
    from the dates of acquisitions. The assets, liabilities, results
    of operations and cash flows of all discontinued operations have
    been separately reported as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented. Certain amounts in prior years have been
    reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

2.

Acquisitions

All of the Company’s acquisitions have been accounted for
    under Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 805,
    Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Accordingly, the
    accounts of the acquired companies, after adjustments to reflect
    fair market values assigned to assets and liabilities, have been
    included in the consolidated financial statements from their
    respective dates of acquisition. The 2009 acquisitions (see list
    below) are wholly-owned and had an aggregate cost of
    $222.0 million, net of cash acquired, plus the issuance of
    $6.4 million of common stock for aggregate consideration of
    $228.4 million at the date of acquisition. There is no
    material contingent consideration related to the acquisitions at
    December 31, 2009. In connection with certain acquisitions
    that occurred prior to January 1, 2009, the Company had
    reserves related to severance and facility closings of
    $0.9 million and $27.9 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. During the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2009 the reserves were reduced by payments of
    $11.6 million and non-cash adjustments of
    $15.4 million. During the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company recorded payments and
    non-cash adjustments of $28.1 million and
    $2.3 million, respectively.

    intellectual property of Tyler Refrigeration, a manufacturer of
    refrigerated display merchandiser and refrigeration systems for
    the food industry which was a unit

of Carrier Corporation. Hill PHOENIX also purchased Tyler’s
    five service and installation branch businesses. Tyler enhances
    the Company’s portfolio of industry-leading proprietary
    technology and adds key talent that augments product innovation,
    engineering, field support and other customer related functions
    at Hill PHOENIX. The transaction also improves the
    Company’s position in commercial refrigeration.

On November 17, 2009, Hill PHOENIX acquired substantially
    all of the assets of Barker Company, Limited and all of the
    issued and outstanding stock of its sister company, Barker Sales
    and Service, Inc. (collectively the “Barker Company”).
    The Barker Company specializes in manufacturing display cases
    for supermarkets, convenience stores and food service. The
    Barker Company will complement and substantially increase Hill
    PHOENIX’s specialty product offerings and enable Hill
    PHOENIX to meet increasing demand for more specialized and
    highly customized products in the fast-growing specialty
    merchandiser segment. Hill PHOENIX will also benefit from
    capabilities sharing, an improved cost position and revenue
    synergies.

On December 30, 2009, Waukesha Bearings acquired
    substantially all of the assets of Inpro/Seal Company, a
    manufacturer of bearing isolator technologies. The purchase
    included the issuance of approximately 151,000 common shares.
    These shares have a six month restriction on sale. The
    acquisition of Inpro/Seal Company adds a broad range of rotating
    equipment applications and is an adjacent product line to
    Waukesha’s bearing solutions for oil and gas and power
    generation markets. The Inpro/Seal Company brand has been very
    successful in North America and, when leveraged across
    Waukesha’s global footprint, is expected to provide
    opportunities for growth internationally. Waukesha expects to
    realize additional synergies through the Company’s global
    sourcing initiatives and from joint technology development as
    manufacturers and end-users of rotating equipment seek more
    advanced, integrated solutions.

For certain acquisitions that occurred in the fourth quarter of
    2009, the Company is in the process of obtaining or finalizing
    appraisals of tangible and intangible assets and it is
    continuing to evaluate the initial purchase price allocations,
    as of the acquisition date, which will be adjusted as additional
    information relative to the fair values of the assets and
    liabilities of the businesses become known. Accordingly,
    management has used their best estimate in the initial purchase
    price allocation as of the date of these financial statements.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the dates of all
    2009 acquisitions and the amounts assigned to goodwill and

These pro forma results of operations have been prepared for
    comparative purposes only and include certain adjustments to
    actual financial results for the relevant periods, such as
    imputed financing costs, and estimated additional amortization
    and depreciation expense as a result of intangibles and fixed
    assets acquired, measured at fair value. They do not purport to
    be indicative of the results of operations that actually would
    have resulted had the acquisitions occurred on the date
    indicated or that may result in the future.

Dispositions


During the first and fourth quarters of 2009, the Company
    recorded in aggregate, a $10.3 million (after-tax)
    write-down to the carrying value of a business held for sale.
    The write-down and other adjustments resulted  in a net
    after-tax loss on sale of approximately $11.2 million for
    the year. The after-tax loss from discontinued operations for
    the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 is approximately
    $15.5 million. At December 31, 2009, only one business
    remains held for sale.


During the fourth quarter of 2008 the Company closed on a sale
    of a line of business in the Electronic Technologies segment
    resulting in a $7.5 million (after-tax) gain, which was
    recorded in Selling and administrative expenses in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue
    and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may be
    adjusted due to changes in future economic, industry or customer
    financial conditions, as well as changes in technology or
    demand. Significant estimates include allowances for doubtful
    accounts receivable, net realizable value of inventories,
    restructuring reserves, valuation of goodwill and intangible
    assets, pension and post retirement assumptions, useful lives
    associated with amortization and depreciation of intangibles and
    fixed assets, warranty reserves, income taxes and tax valuation
    reserves, environmental reserves, legal reserves, insurance
    reserves and the valuations of discontinued assets and
    liabilities.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits
    and short-term investments which are highly liquid in nature and
    have original maturities at the time of purchase of three months
    or less.

Short-Term
    Investments

Short-term investments consist of bank term deposits that have
    original maturity dates that range from six to nine months. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had
    $223.8 million and $279.5 million of bank term
    deposits that earn a weighted average interest rate of 1.01% and
    4.68%, respectively.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable is composed principally of trade accounts
    receivable that arise primarily from the sale of goods or
    services on account and are stated at historical cost.
    Management at each operating company evaluates accounts
    receivable to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that
    will not be collected in the future and records the appropriate
    provision. The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a
    charge to operating expense and reduces accounts receivable. The
    estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based primarily on
    management’s evaluation of the aging of the accounts
    receivable balance, the financial condition of its customers,
    historical trends and the time outstanding of specific balances.
    Actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from
    management’s estimates due to changes in future economic,
    industry or customers’ financial conditions.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade
    receivables, accounts payable, notes payable and accrued
    expenses approximated fair value as of December 31, 2009
    and 2008 due to the short maturity of less than one year for
    these instruments.

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC
    820”) establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the
    Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
    the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A
    financial instruments categorization within the hierarchy is
    based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
    fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of
    inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1:

inputs are unadjusted quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2:

inputs other than level 1
    that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as
    quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and
    liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
    liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that
    are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data
    for substantially the full term of assets or liabilities.

    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Level 3:

unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The following table sets forth the Company’s financial
    assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis at December 31, 2009 by the level within

Short term investments are included in current assets in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets, and generally consist of bank term
    deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days.

Inventories

Inventories for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries,
    including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the
    lower of cost, determined on the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is
    stated at cost, determined on the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Future
    inventory valuations could differ from management’s
    estimates due to changes in economic, industry or customer
    financial conditions, as well as unanticipated changes in
    technology or demand.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment includes the historic cost of
    land, buildings, equipment and significant improvements to
    existing plant and equipment or, in the case of acquisitions, a
    fair market value appraisal of such assets completed at the time
    of acquisition. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor
    renewals are expensed as incurred. When property or equipment is
    sold or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
    depreciation is removed from the respective accounts and the
    gain or loss realized on disposition is reflected in earnings.
    Depreciation expense was $159.6 million in 2009,
    $159.3 million in 2008 and $151.7 million in 2007 and
    was calculated on a straight-line basis for assets acquired
    during all periods presented. The Company depreciates its assets
    over their estimated useful lives as follows: buildings and
    improvements 5 to 31.5 years; machinery and equipment 3 to
    7 years; furniture and fixtures 3 to 7 years; and
    vehicles 3 years.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company periodically enters into financial transactions
    specifically to hedge its exposures to various items, including,
    but not limited to, interest rate and foreign exchange rate
    risk. Through various programs, the Company hedges its cash flow
    exposures to foreign exchange rate risk by entering into foreign
    exchange forward contracts and collars. The Company does not
    enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
    purposes and does not have a material portfolio of derivative
    financial instruments.

The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or
    liabilities on the balance sheet and measures those instruments
    at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value
    hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair value of the
    derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged
    risk are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in
    fair value of the exposures being hedged in the same period. If
    the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective
    portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are
    recorded in other comprehensive earnings and are recognized in
    earnings as the hedged transaction occurs. Ineffective portions
    of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized
    in earnings immediately.

Tests for hedge ineffectiveness are conducted periodically and
    any ineffectiveness found is recognized in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. The fair market value of all
    outstanding transactions is recorded in Other assets and
    deferred charges, or in the Other deferrals section of the
    balance sheet, as applicable. The corresponding



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

change in value of the hedged assets/liabilities is recorded
    directly in that section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses
    over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. In
    accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and
    Other (“ASC 350”), the Company does not amortize
    goodwill. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually
    unless indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant
    sustained change in the business climate, during the interim
    periods.

For 2009 and 2008, the Company identified 10 reporting units
    each year for its annual goodwill test which was performed as of
    September 30. Step one of the test compared the fair value
    of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method to its
    book value. This method uses the Company’s own market
    assumptions including projecting future cash flows, determining
    appropriate discount rates, and other assumptions which are
    reasonable and inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis.
    The projections are based on historical performance and future
    estimated results. These assumptions require significant
    judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and
    estimated amounts. Step two, which compares the book value of
    the goodwill to its implied fair value, was not necessary since
    there were no indicators of potential impairment from step one.
    For information related to the amount of the Company’s
    goodwill by segment, see Note 7.

Indefinite-Lived
    Intangible Assets

Similar to goodwill, the Company tests indefinite-lived,
    intangible assets (primarily trademarks) at least annually
    unless indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant
    sustained change in the business climate, during the interim
    periods. In performing these tests, the Company uses a
    discounted cash flow method to calculate and compare the fair
    value of the intangible to its book value. This method uses the
    Company’s own market assumptions which are reasonable and
    inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis. If the fair value
    is less than the book value of the intangibles, an impairment
    charge would be recognized. For information related to the
    amount of the Company’s intangible asset classes, see
    Note 7.

Long-Lived
    Assets

In accordance with ASC 360, Property Plant and Equipment
    (“ASC 360”) long-lived assets (including intangible
    assets that are amortized) are reviewed for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount of an asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant
    sustained change in the business climate, during the interim
    periods. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping
    of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is
    produced and compared to its carrying value. If an asset is
    determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of
    the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value as
    determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. There
    were no indicators of impairment noted during 2009.

Foreign
    Currency

Assets and liabilities of

non-U.S. subsidiaries,

where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have
    been translated at year-end exchange rates and profit and loss
    accounts have been translated using weighted average yearly
    exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from translation have been
    recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as
    cumulative translation adjustments. Assets and liabilities of an
    entity that are denominated in currencies other than an
    entity’s functional currency are remeasured into the
    functional currency using end of period exchange rates or
    historical rates where applicable to certain balances. Gains and
    losses related to these remeasurements are recorded within the
    Statements of Operations as a component of Other Expense
    (Income), net.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances
    are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, b) price is fixed or determinable,
    c) collectability is reasonably assured, and
    d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where
    installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the
    installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of
    the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving
    non-essential installation obligations are those which can
    generally be completed in a short period of time at
    insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these
    installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases
    can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the
    installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the
    delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until
    installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined
    that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the
    Company will allocate consideration received to the separate
    deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize
    revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable
    identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other
    post-shipment obligations such as training and customer
    acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is
    deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance
    has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned
    when services are performed and is not significant to any period
    presented. The Company recognizes contract revenue under
    percentage of completion accounting using the cost to cost
    method as the measure of progress. The application of percentage
    of completion accounting requires estimates of future revenues
    and contract costs over the full term of the contract. The
    Company updates project cost estimates on a quarterly basis or
    more frequently, when changes in circumstances warrant.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company records stock-based compensation expense on a
    straight-line basis, generally over the explicit service period
    of three years (except for retirement eligible employees and
    retirees). Awards granted to retirement eligible employees are
    expensed immediately and the Company shortens the vesting
    period, for expensing purposes, for any employee who will become
    eligible to retire within the three-year explicit service
    period. Expense for these employees is recorded over the period
    from the date of grant through the date the employee first
    becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide
    service. For additional information related to stock-based
    compensation, including activity for 2009, 2008 and 2007, see
    Note 10.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes on continuing operations includes
    federal, state, local and

non-U.S. taxes.

Tax credits, primarily for research and experimentation and

non-U.S. earnings,

export programs, and U.S. manufacturer’s tax deduction
    are recognized as a reduction of the provision for income taxes
    on continuing operations in the year in which they are available
    for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are provided on temporary
    differences between assets and liabilities for financial and tax
    reporting purposes as measured by enacted tax rates expected to
    apply when temporary differences are settled or realized. Future
    tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of
    those benefits is considered to be more likely than not. A
    valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for
    which realization is not assured. The Company has not provided
    for any residual U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings
    of non-U.S. subsidiaries as such earnings are currently
    intended to be indefinitely reinvested.

ASC 740 specifies the way companies are to account for
    uncertainty in income tax reporting, and prescribes a
    methodology for recognizing, reversing and measuring the tax
    benefits of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a
    tax return. The provisions of this guidance became effective
    January 1, 2007 and, as a result of adopting these
    provisions, the Company recorded a $58.2 million increase
    to reserves as a “cumulative effect” decrease to
    opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2007, of which
    $53.4 million was included in continuing operations.
    Including this “cumulative effect” adjustment, the
    Company had unrecognized tax benefits, net of indirect benefits
    and deposits, of $190.5 million at January 1, 2007, of
    which $35.4 million related to accrued interest and
    penalties. The portion of the unrecognized tax benefits at
    January 1, 2007 included in continuing operations totaled



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$147.6 million, of which $28.0 million related to
    accrued interest and penalties. For additional information on
    the Company’s income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits,
    see Note 11.

Research
    and Development Costs

Research and development costs, including qualifying engineering
    costs, are expensed when incurred and amounted to
    $178.3 million in 2009, $189.2 million in 2008 and
    $193.2 million in 2007.

Risk,
    Retention, Insurance

The Company currently self-insures its product and commercial
    general liability claims up to $5.0 million per occurrence,
    its workers’ compensation claims up to $0.5 million
    per occurrence, and automobile liability claims up to
    $1.0 million per occurrence. Third-party insurance provides
    primary level coverage in excess of these amounts up to certain
    specified limits. In addition, the Company has excess liability
    insurance from third-party insurers on both an aggregate and an
    individual occurrence basis well in excess of the limits of the
    primary coverage. A worldwide program of property insurance
    covers the Company’s owned and leased property and any
    business interruptions that may occur due to an insured hazard
    affecting those properties, subject to reasonable deductibles
    and aggregate limits. The Company’s property and casualty
    insurance programs contain various deductibles that, based on
    the Company’s experience, are typical and customary for a
    company of its size and risk profile. The Company does not
    consider any of the deductibles to represent a material risk to
    the Company. The Company generally maintains deductibles for
    claims and liabilities related primarily to workers’
    compensation, health and welfare claims, general commercial,
    product and automobile liability and property damage, and
    business interruption resulting from certain events. The Company
    accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and
    can be reasonably estimated. As part of the Company’s risk
    management program, insurance is maintained to transfer risk
    beyond the level of self-retention and provides protection on
    both an individual claim and annual aggregate basis.

    $250 million of 6.60% notes due 2038. The net proceeds
    of $594.1 million from the notes were used to repay
    borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program,
    and were reflected in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets at December 31, 2008. The notes and debentures are
    redeemable at the option of the Company in whole or in part at
    any time at a redemption price that includes a make-whole
    premium, with accrued interest to the redemption date.

During the first quarter of 2008, the Company entered into
    several interest rate swaps in anticipation of the debt
    financing completed on March 14, 2008 which, upon
    settlement, resulted in a net gain of $1.2 million which
    was deferred and will be amortized over the life of the related
    notes.

The Company may, from time to time, enter into interest rate
    swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes.
    Interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange fixed and
    variable rate payments based on notional principal amounts.
    There is an outstanding swap agreement for a total notional
    amount of $50.0 million, or CHF65.1 million, which
    swaps the U.S. dollar

6-month

LIBOR rate and the Swiss Franc

6-month

LIBOR rate. This agreement hedges a portion of the
    Company’s net investment in

non-U.S. operations

and matures on February 15, 2011. The fair value
    outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008, included a loss
    of $13.3 million and $12.0 respectively, which was based on
    quoted market prices for similar instruments ( Level 2
    inputs under the ASC 820 hierarchy). The change in fair value of
    this hedge, which was not significant during 2009, is recorded
    in Cumulative Translation Adjustments and in Other Deferrals in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This hedge is effective.

There are no amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge
    effectiveness and there are no credit risk related contingent
    features in the Company’s derivative instruments. In
    addition, the amount of gains or losses from hedging activity
    recorded in earnings is not significant and the amount of
    unrealized gains or losses from cash flow hedges which are
    expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve
    months is not significant. The majority of the Company’s
    hedged exposure for forecasted transactions ranges in the length
    of time of up to one year. The Company believes it is probable
    that all forecasted cash flow transactions will occur.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument
    contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by the
    these counterparties is considered unlikely as the
    Company’s policy is to contract with highly rated
    diversified counterparties. See Note 4 for additional
    information on the Company’s derivative and hedging
    activity.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had open foreign exchange
    forward purchase contracts expiring through December 2010
    related to cash flow and fair value hedges of foreign currency
    exposures. The fair values of these contracts were based on
    quoted market prices for identical instruments as of
    December 31, 2009 (Level 1 under the ASC 820
    hierarchy). See Note 4 for additional information on the
    Company’s derivative and hedging activity.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company entered into a
    foreign currency hedge which was subsequently settled within the
    quarter. As a result of terminating the hedge, the Company
    recorded a gain of $2.4 million in the third quarter ended
    September 30, 2008.

On November 9, 2007, the Company entered into a
    $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility
    with a syndicate of banks (the “Credit Agreement”)
    which replaced a facility with substantially similar terms. At
    the Company’s election, loans under the Credit Agreement
    will bear interest at a Eurodollar or Sterling rate based on
    LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.130% to 0.35%
    (subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded the
    Company’s senior unsecured debt by S&P and
    Moody’s), or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined
    in the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement
    requires the Company to pay a facility fee and a utilization fee
    in certain circumstances and imposes various restrictions on the
    Company such as, among other things, the requirement for the
    Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to
    consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.5 to 1. The
    Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at
    December 31, 2009 and had a coverage ratio of 9.1 to 1. The
    Company primarily uses this facility as liquidity

back-up

for
    its commercial paper program and has not drawn down any loans
    under the $1 billion facility and does not anticipate doing
    so. As of December 31, 2009, no commercial paper was
    outstanding.

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company closed a
    structured five-year, non-interest bearing, $165.1 million
    amortizing loan with a non-US lender, which also included a
    participation fee received by the Company of $9.9 million.
    The loan was recorded at face value. The Company also expects to
    incur a total of $5.7 million in debt related issuance
    costs over the course of the loan. Beginning in April 2007, the
    repayment schedule requires payments every April and September
    with the final payment to be made in July 2011. The
    participation fee will be

amortized ratably into Other Expense (income), net over the term
    of the loan and is recorded in Other Deferrals in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. The loan agreement includes a put
    and call provision that could have been exercised starting in
    June 2008 through the end of the loan term.

In November 2008, the Canadian Dollar Credit Facility with the
    Bank of Nova Scotia expired. The Company did not renew the
    facility in 2008.

Notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt shown on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets for 2008 principally represented
    commercial paper issued in the U.S. The weighted average
    interest rate for short-term borrowings for the years 2009 and
    2008 was 0.3% and 2.4%, respectively. The commercial paper
    balance was paid in full as of December 31, 2009.

The Company’s long-term debt with a book value of $1,860.9
    million, of which $35.6 million matures in less than one
    year, had a fair value of approximately $1,954.6 million at
    December 31, 2009. On December 31, 2008, the
    Company’s long-term debt instruments had a book value of
    $1,892.9 million and a fair value of approximately
    $2,018.5 million. The estimated fair value of the long-term
    debt is based on quoted market prices for similar issues.

Equity
    and Cash Incentive Program

    Equity and Cash Incentive Plan

On April 20, 2004, the shareholders approved the Dover
    Corporation 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2005
    Plan”) to replace the 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan and
    1995 Cash Performance Program (the “1995 Plan”), which
    expired on January 30, 2005. Under the 2005 Plan, a maximum
    aggregate of 20 million shares were reserved for grants
    (non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock settled stock
    appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, and
    performance share awards) to key personnel between
    February 1, 2005 and January 31, 2015, provided that
    no incentive stock options shall be granted under the plan after
    February 11, 2014 and a maximum of two million shares may
    be granted as restricted stock or performance share awards. The
    exercise price of options and SARs may not be less than the fair
    market value of the stock at the time the awards are granted.
    The period during which these options and SARs are exercisable
    is fixed by the Company’s Compensation Committee at the



DOVER

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

time of grant, but generally may not commence sooner than three
    years after the date of grant, and may not exceed ten years from
    the date of grant. All stock options or SARs issued under the
    1995 Plan or the 2005 Plan vest after three years of service and
    expire at the end of ten years. All stock options and SARs are
    granted at regularly scheduled quarterly Compensation Committee
    meetings (usually only at the meeting during the first quarter)
    and have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the
    Company’s stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date
    of grant. New common shares are issued when options or SARs are
    exercised.

Performance
    Share Awards

In May 2009, the shareholders of the Company approved an
    amendment to the 2005 Plan allowing the granting of performance
    share awards that will become payable in common shares upon
    achievement of pre-established performance targets. The changes
    to the 2005 Plan are detailed in the Company’s Proxy
    Statement dated March 24, 2009 under the heading
    “Proposal 2 — Proposal to Approve Amendments
    to the 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plans.” Performance
    share awards granted under the 2005 Plan are being expensed over
    the three year period that is the requisite performance and
    service period. Awards shall become vested if (1) the
    Company achieves certain specified stock performance targets
    compared to a peer group of 38 companies and (2) the
    employee remains continuously employed by the company during the
    performance period. Partial vesting may occur for certain
    terminations not for cause and for retirements. The estimated
    compensation expense recognized for performance share awards is
    net of estimated forfeitures. The Company assesses performance
    levels quarterly. Compensation expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was $0.6 million. Unrecognized
    compensation expense cost as of December 31, 2009 is $0.7
    million which will be recognized over a weighted average period
    of 1.9 years.

The Company also has restricted stock authorized for grant (as
    part of the 2005 Plan), under which common stock of the Company
    may be granted at no cost to certain officers and key employees.
    In general, restrictions limit the sale or transfer of these
    shares during a two or three year period, and restrictions lapse
    proportionately over the two or three year period. The Company
    did not grant any restricted shares in 2009, 2008 or 2007, and
    there are no grants outstanding as of December 31, 2009.

The Company has a stock compensation plan under which
    non-employee directors are granted shares of the Company’s
    common stock each year as more than half of their compensation
    for serving as directors. During 2009, the Company issued an
    aggregate of 14,726 shares, of its common stock to eleven
    outside directors (after withholding 6,823 additional shares to
    satisfy tax obligations) as partial compensation for serving as
    directors of the Company during 2009. During 2008, the Company
    issued an aggregate of 29,213 shares, net, of its common
    stock to twelve outside directors (after withholding 11,582
    additional shares to satisfy tax obligations) as partial
    compensation for serving as directors of the Company during
    2008. During 2007, the Company issued an aggregate of
    14,129 shares of its common stock, net, to twelve outside
    directors (after withholding an aggregate of 6,056 additional
    shares to satisfy tax obligations) as partial compensation for
    serving as directors of the Company during 2007.

non-U.S. losses

is available to be carried forward, with $20.4 million of these
    losses beginning to expire during the years 2010 through 2029.
    The remaining $53.4 million of such losses can be carried
    forward indefinitely.

The Company has loss carryforwards for state purposes as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $220.9 and
    $205.3 million, respectively. The state loss carryforwards

DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company maintains valuation allowances by jurisdiction
    against the deferred tax assets related to certain of these
    carryforwards as utilization of these tax benefits is not
    assured for certain jurisdictions.

The Company has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes
    or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings of its
    international subsidiaries because such earnings are reinvested
    and it is currently intended that they will continue to be
    reinvested indefinitely. At December 31, 2009, the Company
    has not provided for federal income taxes on earnings of
    approximately $668.9 million from its international
    subsidiaries.

In 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized $33.7 and
    $18.3 million, respectively, in tax benefits related to the
    resolution of various state and U.S. income tax issues.

Unrecognized
    Tax Benefits

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted certain
    provisions of ASC 740. See Note 4 for additional
    information on the impact of adoption on the Company’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company files Federal income tax returns, as well as
    multiple state, local and

non-U.S. jurisdiction

tax returns. The Company is no longer subject to examinations of
    its federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”) for years through 2006. All significant state
    and local, and international matters have been concluded for
    years through 1993 and 2000, respectively. With the exception of
    matters in litigation, for which an estimate cannot be made due
    to uncertainties, the Company does not believe it is reasonably
    possible that its unrecognized tax benefits will significantly
    change within the next twelve months.

The following table is a reconciliation of the beginning and

If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that

    2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded potential interest and
    penalty expense of $5.0 million, $(0.6) million and
    $12.9 million, respectively, related to its unrecognized
    tax benefits as a component of provision for income taxes. The
    Company had accrued interest and penalties of $46.5 million
    at December 31, 2009 and $45.9 million at
    December 31, 2008.

Commitments
    and Contingent Liabilities

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal
    proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites
    identified under Federal and State statutes that provide for the
    allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible
    parties.” In each instance, the extent of the
    Company’s liability appears to be very small in relation to
    the total projected expenditures and the number of other
    “potentially responsible parties” involved and is
    anticipated to

    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few of the
    Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial
    activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with
    regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been
    established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to
    a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their
    businesses. These proceedings primarily involve claims by
    private parties alleging injury arising out of use of the
    Company’s products, exposure to hazardous substances or
    patent infringement, litigation and administrative proceedings
    involving employment matters and commercial disputes. Management
    and legal counsel periodically review the probable outcome of
    such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably expected to
    be incurred, the availability and extent of insurance coverage,
    and established reserves. While it is not possible at this time
    to predict the outcome of these legal actions or any need for
    additional reserves, in the opinion of management, based on
    these reviews, it is unlikely that the disposition of the
    lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, cash flows or competitive position of the Company.

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
    operating leases, many of which contain renewal options. Total
    rental expense, net of insignificant sublease rental income, for
    all operating leases was $74.9 million, $76.7 million and
    $70.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Contingent rentals under the
    operating leases were not significant.

The aggregate future minimum lease payments for operating and
    capital leases as of December 31, 2009 are as follows:

Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company offers a defined contribution plan to most of its
    employees. The Company also has defined benefit pension plans
    (the “plans”) covering certain employees of the
    Company and its subsidiaries. The plans’ benefits are
    generally based on years of service and employee compensation.
    The Company’s funding policy is consistent with the funding
    requirements of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act
    (“ERISA”) and applicable international laws. The
    Company adopted certain provisions of ASC 715 on
    December 31, 2006 and, in accordance with the standard, the
    Company used a measurement date of December 31st for
    its pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and thereafter. Prior to 2008, the
    Company used a September 30th measurement date for the
    majority of its defined benefit plans.



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company is responsible for overseeing the management of the
    investments of the plans’ assets and otherwise ensuring
    that the plans’ investment programs are in compliance with
    ERISA, other relevant legislation, and related plan documents.
    Where relevant, the Company has retained professional investment
    managers to manage the plans’ assets and implement the
    investment process. The investment managers, in implementing
    their investment processes, have the authority and
    responsibility to select appropriate investments in the asset
    classes specified by the terms of their applicable prospectus or
    investment manager agreements with the plans.

The primary financial objective of the plans is to secure
    participant retirement benefits. Accordingly, the key objective
    in the plans’ financial management is to promote stability
    and, to the extent appropriate, growth in the funded status.
    Related and supporting financial objectives are established in
    conjunction with a review of current and projected plan
    financial requirements.

The assets of the plans are invested to achieve an appropriate
    return for the plans consistent with a prudent level of risk.
    The asset return objective is to achieve, as a minimum over
    time, the passively managed return earned by market index funds,
    weighted in the proportions outlined by the asset class
    exposures identified in the plans’ strategic allocation.
    The fair value of the majority of the plans’ assets were
    determined by the plans’ trustees using quoted market
    prices for identical instruments ( Level 1 inputs under the
    ASC 820 hierarchy) as of December 31, 2009. The fair value
    of various other investments were determined by the plans’
    trustees using directly observable market corroborated inputs,
    including quoted prices for similar assets ( Level 2 inputs
    under the ASC 820 hierarchy). There are no investments within
    the Level 3 fair value hierarchy. The following is a
    description of the valuation methodologies used for assets at
    fair value:

Common stock: valued at prices obtained from exchanges where the
    stock is traded.

Fixed income investments: these investments consist of corporate
    bonds which are valued in active markets in which the bonds are
    traded. Other corporate bonds are valued based on yields
    currently available on comparable securities of issuers with
    similar credit ratings. Other fixed income securities include
    U.S. Government and municipal securities. These investments are
    valued based on quoted prices in active markets in which the
    security is traded or are valued based on yield curves and
    credit information evaluated in pricing models.

Debt, equity and other funds: investments are valued using Net
    Asset Value (“NAV”) which is based on the underlying
    value of the assets owned by the funds, minus liabilities, then
    divided by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV is a quoted
    price in an active market.

The expected return on assets assumption used for pension
    expense was developed through analysis of historical market
    returns, current market conditions and the past experience of
    plan asset investments. In developing the expected return on
    asset assumption, estimates of future market returns by asset
    category are less than actual long-term historical returns in
    order to best anticipate future experience. Overall, it is
    projected that the investment of plan assets will achieve a
    7.75% net return over time from the asset allocation strategy.

The Company’s discount rate assumption is determined by
    developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds
    with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit
    payment streams. The plans’ expected cash flows are then
    discounted by the resulting

year-by-year

spot rates.

The Company also provides, through non-qualified plans,
    supplemental retirement benefits in excess of qualified plan
    limits imposed by Federal tax law. These plans are supported by
    the general assets of the Company.

Pension cost for all defined contribution, defined benefit, and
    supplemental plans was $72.9 million for 2009,
    $81.7 million for 2008 and $83.6 million for 2007.

For post-retirement benefit measurement purposes, a 8.5% annual
    rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits
    (i.e., health care cost trend rates) was assumed for 2010. The
    rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5% by the year 2018
    and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend
    rate assumption can have an effect on the amounts reported. For
    example, increasing (decreasing) the assumed health care cost
    trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase
    (decrease) the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as
    of December 31, 2009 by $0.2 million ($0.2 million) and
    would have a negligible impact on the net post-retirement
    benefit cost for 2009.

The post-retirement benefit plans cover approximately 1,924
    participants, approximately 1,082 of whom are eligible for
    medical benefits. The plans are effectively closed to new
    entrants. The post-retirement benefit obligation amounts at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 include approximately $4.8
    million and $4.6 million in obligations, respectively,
    recorded in discontinued operations.

Revenue is attributed to regions based on the location of the
    Company’s customer, which in some instances is an
    intermediary and not necessarily the end user. Long-lived assets
    are comprised of net property, plant and equipment. The
    Company’s operating companies are based primarily in the
    United States of America and Europe. The Company’s
    businesses serve thousands of customers, none of which accounted
    for more than 10% of consolidated revenue. Accordingly, it is
    impractical to provide revenue from external customers for each
    product and service sold by segment.

Shareholders’
    Equity

The Company has the authority to issue up to 100,000 shares
    of $100 par value preferred stock and up to
    500,000,000 shares of $1 par value common stock. None
    of the preferred stock has been issued. As of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, 247,343,411 and 246,615,007 shares of common
    stock were issued, respectively. In addition, the Company had
    60,467,393 and 60,618,384 shares in treasury, held at cost,
    as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Share
    Repurchases


The Company had no share repurchases in 2009. In May 2007, the
    Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
    10,000,000 shares through May 2012. Approximately
    8.9 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under
    the five year authorization as of December 31, 2009.


During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Board of Directors
    approved a $500 million share repurchase program
    authorizing repurchases of the Company’s common shares
    through the end of 2008. During the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased
    10,000,000 shares of its common stock in the open market at
    an average price of $46.15 per share. As of December 31,
    2008, all shares authorized by the program were purchased.


During the third quarter of 2007, the Board of Directors
    approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase
    of 10,000,000 common shares. The Company entered into an
    accelerated share repurchase agreement on August 2, 2007
    (“ASR”) under which it purchased 6,000,000 shares
    of its common stock at an initial purchase price of $51.64 per
    share. Upon final settlement of this ASR in the fourth quarter
    of 2007, the final economic purchase price was $48.36 per share,
    representing an average of the volume weighted average price of
    the Company’s common stock during the outstanding period
    less a negotiated discount amount. In addition, during 2007, the
    Company made other open market purchases of its common stock
    totaling 6.4 million shares at an average price of $46.78
    per share.

    Subsequent Events

The Company assessed events occurring subsequent to
    December 31, 2009 and through our filing, dated
    February 19, 2010, for potential recognition and disclosure
    in the consolidated financial statements. No events have
    occurred that would require adjustment to or disclosure in the
    consolidated financial statements which were issued on
    February 19, 2010.

18.
    Adoption of New Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under
    ASC 805, which retains the fundamental requirements that the
    acquisition method of accounting (the purchase method) be used
    for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be
    identified for each business combination. In general, the
    statement (1) extends its applicability to all events where
    one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses,
    (2) broadens the use of fair value measurements used to
    recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
    (3) changes the accounting for acquisition related fees and
    restructuring costs incurred in connection with an acquisition,
    and (4) increases required disclosures. The Company has
    applied the provisions of this guidance prospectively to
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
    after January 1, 2009. The impact of these provisions did
    not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements since its adoption.

In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC
    805 for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent
    measurement and accounting, and disclosures for assets and
    liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations.
    ASC 805 eliminates the distinction between contractual and
    non-contractual contingencies. The Company has applied the
    provisions of this guidance prospectively to business
    combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after
    January 1, 2009. The impact of these provisions did not
    have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements since its adoption.



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In April 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC
    350 and ASC 275, Risks and Uncertainties (“ASC 275”),
    to improve the consistency between the useful life of a
    recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash
    flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible asset.
    ASC 350 and ASC 275 amend the factors to be considered when
    developing renewal or extension assumptions that are used to
    estimate an intangible asset’s useful life. The guidance is
    to be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after
    December 31, 2008. In addition, ASC 350 and ASC 275
    increase the disclosure requirements related to renewal or
    extension assumptions. The Company has applied the provisions of
    this guidance to business combinations for which the acquisition
    date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact of ASC 350
    and ASC 275 did not have a material effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements since its adoption.

In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under
    ASC 715, Compensation — Retirement Benefits (“ASC
    715”) which amends the disclosure requirements about plan
    assets of a defined pension or other postretirement plan. The
    provisions of this guidance require disclosure of (1) how
    investment allocation decisions are made, including factors that
    are pertinent to an understanding of the investment policies and
    strategies, (2) the fair value of each major category of
    plan assets, (3) the inputs and valuation techniques used
    to determine fair value and (4) an understanding of
    significant concentration of risk in plan assets. The provisions
    of this guidance become effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2009 and are to be applied prospectively. The
    adoption of the amendments under ASC 715 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective December 31, 2006, the Company applied certain
    provisions of ASC 715 which required companies to report the
    funded status of their defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans on their balance sheets as a net
    liability or asset. Upon adoption at December 31, 2006, the
    Company recorded a net reduction to shareholders’ equity of
    $123.5 million, net of tax. In addition, effective for
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, the new
    standard required companies to measure benefit obligations and
    plan assets as of a company’s fiscal year end
    (December 31, 2008 for the Company), using one of the
    methods prescribed in the standard. The Company adopted the new
    valuation date requirements using the

15-month

alternative, as prescribed in the standard, which resulted in a
    charge of approximately $5.8 million, net of tax, to
    retained earnings during the fourth quarter of 2008.

In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC
    855, Subsequent Events (“ASC 855”) which establishes
    general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events
    that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
    statements are issued or are available to be issued. ASC 855
    became effective for interim or annual financial periods ending
    after June 15, 2009 and was adopted in the second quarter
    of 2009. The adoption of ASC 855 did not have a material effect
    on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC
    105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“ASC
    105”), which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification (“Codification”) as the source of
    authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be
    applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
    accounting principles. ASC 105 became effective for financial
    statements issued for interim periods ended after
    September 15, 2009. All content within the Codification
    carries the same level of authority. The adoption of ASC 105 did
    not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under
    ASC 820, Fair Value measurement and disclosures (“ASC
    820) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. For financial assets and liabilities,
    this guidance was effective for fiscal periods beginning after
    November 15, 2007 and did not require any new fair value
    measurements. The adoption of this guidance on January 1,
    2008 did not have a material effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements. In February 2008, the FASB
    delayed the effective date for nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities to



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, except for
    items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
    financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually).
    The adoption of the provisions of ASC 820 related to
    “non-financial assets” did not have a material effect
    on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC
    825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”) to require
    disclosures about fair value of financial instruments not
    measured on the balance sheet at fair value in interim financial
    statements as well as in annual financial statements. The
    provisions of this guidance require all entities to disclose the
    methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair
    value of financial instruments. ASC 825 became effective for
    interim periods ended after June 15, 2009 and does not
    require comparative disclosure for earlier periods presented
    upon initial adoption. The adoption of ASC 825 did not have a
    material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Changes
    in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31,
    2009 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
    Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
    Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and
    communicated to the Company’s management, including its
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
    appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

During the fourth quarter of 2009, there were no changes in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations Over Internal Controls

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that:

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that the Company’s receipts and
    expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of the Company’s management and
    directors; and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
    on the financial statements.

Management’s report on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the
    Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all
    errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
    are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
    the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
    of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
    of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance
    that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have
    been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those
    internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.
