PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Dover Corporation (“Dover” or the
    “Company”), incorporated in 1947 in the State of
    Delaware, became a publicly traded company in 1955. The Company
    owns and operates a global portfolio of manufacturing companies
    providing innovative components and equipment, specialty systems
    and support services for a variety of applications in the
    industrial products, engineered systems, fluid management and
    electronic technologies markets. Additional information is
    contained in Items 7 and 8.

Recent
    Events

In the fall of 2004, the Company embarked on a strategic
    portfolio review, looking at all of its companies to determine
    whether every company warranted continued ownership and
    investment. As part of that process, the Company elected to
    expand its executive management team and changed its operating
    structure to accommodate both the strategic review and expanded
    leadership. This resulted in the creation of six segments and 13
    platforms effective October 1, 2004. Over the next three
    years, as a result of the strategic review, Dover decided to
    discontinue and sell 22 businesses with annual revenue of
    approximately $1.3 billion and aggregate operating margins
    of 5%, generating net proceeds of $696 million. At the same
    time, the Company spent $2.5 billion acquiring 24
    businesses with expected annual revenue of $1.4 billion and
    projected operating margins of 15%.

As a result of these actions, in the third quarter of  2007, the
    Company elected to change its operating structure to more
    logically align its businesses with respect to end markets,
    resulting in the creation of four segments and six platforms,
    which is expected to be the ongoing operating structure for the
    foreseeable future.

Operating
    Structure

The Company reports its results in four business
    segments — Industrial Products, Engineered Systems,
    Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies. Dover discusses
    its operations at the platform level within the Industrial
    Products, Engineered Systems, and Fluid Management segments,
    each of which contains two platforms. Electronic
    Technologies’ results are discussed at the segment level.
    Dover companies within its business segments and platforms

    consumer electronics industries, high frequency capacitors,
    microwave electro-magnetic switches, radio frequency and
    microwave filters, electromagnetic products, frequency
    control/select components and sophisticated automated assembly
    and testing equipment.

Business
    Strategy

The Company operates with certain fundamental business
    strategies. First, it seeks to acquire and own businesses which
    manufacture proprietary engineered industrial products which are
    leaders in four broad markets: Industrial Products, Engineered
    Systems, Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies. To ensure
    success, Dover companies place strong emphasis on new product
    development to better serve customers and expand into new
    product and geographic markets. Second, the Company drives its
    businesses to be committed to operational excellence, and to be
    market leaders as measured by market share, customer service,
    innovation, profitability and return on invested capital. Third,
    the Company is committed to an operating culture with high
    ethical standards, trust, respect and open communication, to
    allow individual growth and operational effectiveness. Fourth,
    the Company seeks to utilize its strong free cash flow in a
    balanced manner to grow its businesses and to increase
    shareholder value.

Management
    Philosophy

The Company’s operating structure of four defined industry
    segments and six core business platforms drives focused
    acquisition activity, accelerates opportunities to identify and
    capture operating synergies, including global sourcing and
    supply chain integration, and advances the development of
    Dover’s executive talent. The presidents of Dover’s
    operating companies and groups have responsibility for their
    businesses’ performance as they are able to serve customers
    by focusing closely on their products and markets, and by
    reacting quickly to customer needs. The Company’s platform,
    segment and executive management sets strategic direction,
    provides oversight, allocates and manages capital, assists in
    major acquisitions and provides other services.

Portfolio
    Development

Acquisitions

Dover’s acquisition program has two elements. First, it
    seeks to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden
    its existing platforms and global reach, manufacture innovative
    components and equipment, specialty systems

and/or

support services, and sell to industrial or commercial users.
    Second, it will strategically pursue larger, stand-alone
    businesses that have the potential to either complement our
    existing companies or allow Dover to pursue a new platform.
    During the period from 2005 through 2007, the Company
    significantly increased the level of acquisition spending,
    buying 24 businesses with an aggregate cost of
    $2.5 billion. Annualized revenue of these companies was
    approximately $1.4 billion as of their date of acquisition
    with projected operating margins in the range of 15%.

In 2007, the Company acquired seven businesses, all of which
    were add-on businesses, for an aggregate cost of
    $273.6 million. In 2006, Dover acquired seven companies
    (five add-ons) for an aggregate cost of $1,116.8 million,
    the highest annual acquisition investment level in its history.
    During 2005, the Company acquired a total of ten businesses
    (eight add-ons) for an aggregate cost of $1,089.7 million.

For more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past
    two years, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8. The Company’s future growth
    depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful
    businesses, as a substantial number of the Company’s
    current businesses operate in relatively mature markets. While
    the Company expects all of its businesses to generate annual
    organic growth of 5 — 7% over a business cycle,
    sustained organic growth at these levels is difficult to achieve
    consistently each year.



Divestitures

While the Company generally expects to hold businesses that it
    buys, during the past three years (2005 —
    2007) the Company engaged in a thorough review of its
    portfolio of businesses to verify that those businesses continue
    to be essential contributors to Dover’s long-term growth
    strategy. Based on that review, the Company has over the past
    three years discontinued 22 and sold 20 operations for an
    aggregate consideration of approximately $696 million. In
    addition, there are occasionally situations in which one of
    Dover’s companies is a very attractive acquisition for
    another company based on specific market conditions. In those
    circumstances, Dover might make an opportunistic sale. For more
    details, see the “Discontinued Operations” discussion
    below and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    in Item 8.

    charges, when necessary, to reduce these businesses to estimated
    fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is determined by using
    quoted market prices, when available, or other accepted

    comparable basis. Please refer to Note 8 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

for additional information on discontinued operations.

Raw
    Materials

Dover’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw
    materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished
    components, which are generally available from a number of
    sources. As a result, shortages or the loss of any single
    supplier have not had, and are not likely to have, a material
    impact on operating profits. While generally available,
    commodity pricing has trended upward over the past few years,
    particularly for various grades of steel, copper, aluminum and
    select other commodities, the Company has generally kept pace,
    or exceeded raw material cost increases, using pricing
    strategies.

Research
    and Development

Dover’s operating companies are encouraged to develop new
    products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to
    satisfy customer needs, expand revenue opportunities
    domestically and internationally, maintain or extend competitive
    advantages, improve product reliability and reduce production
    costs. During 2007, $212.6 million was spent on research
    and development, including qualified engineering costs, compared
    with $155.0 million and $144.7 million in 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

For the Product Identification and Electronic Technologies
    companies, efforts in these areas tend to be particularly
    significant because the rate of product development by their
    customers is often quite high. The companies that develop
    product identification equipment and specialty electronic
    components for the life sciences, datacom and telecom commercial
    markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of
    product performance improvement and reduced costs. The result
    has been that product life cycles in these markets generally
    average less than five years with meaningful sales price
    reductions over that time period.



Dover’s other segments contain many businesses that are
    also involved in important product improvement initiatives.
    These businesses also concentrate on working closely with
    customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and
    market applications, and continuously improving manufacturing
    processes. Most of these businesses experience a much more
    moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is
    generally experienced by the Product Identification platform and
    the Electronic Technologies segment.

Intellectual
    Property and Intangible Assets

Dover companies own many patents, trademarks, licenses and other
    forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over a
    number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various
    times over a number of years. A large portion of the Dover
    companies’ intellectual property consists of patents,
    unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting
    trade secrets that the companies seek to protect in various
    ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and
    suppliers where appropriate. In addition, a significant portion
    of the Company’s intangible assets relate to customer
    relationships. While the Dover companies’ intellectual
    property and customer relationships are important to their
    success, the loss or expiration of any of these rights or
    relationships, or any groups of related rights or relationships,
    is not likely to materially affect the Company on a consolidated
    basis. The Company believes that its companies’ commitment
    to continuous engineering improvements, new product development
    and improved manufacturing techniques, as well as strong sales,
    marketing and service efforts, are significant to their general
    leadership position in the niche markets that they serve.

Seasonality

In general, Dover companies, while not seasonal, tend to have
    stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, particularly
    companies serving the consumer electronics, transportation,
    construction, waste hauling, petroleum, commercial refrigeration
    and food service markets. Companies serving the major equipment
    markets, such as power generation, chemical and processing
    industries, have long lead times geared to seasonal, commercial
    or consumer demands, and tend to delay or accelerate product
    ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends.

Customers

Dover’s companies serve thousands of customers, no one of
    which accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s
    consolidated revenue in 2007. Within each of the four segments,
    no customer accounted for more than 10% of that segment’s
    revenue in 2007.

With respect to the Engineered Systems, Fluid Management and
    Industrial Products segments, customer concentrations are quite
    varied. Companies supplying the waste handling, construction,
    agricultural, defense, energy, automotive and commercial
    refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers
    that are significant within those industries. This also tends to
    be true for companies supplying the power generation, aerospace
    and chemical industries. In the other markets served, there is
    usually a much lower concentration of customers, particularly
    where the companies provide a substantial number of products as
    well as services applicable to a broad range of end use
    applications.

Certain companies within the Electronic Technologies segment
    serve the military, space, aerospace, commercial and
    datacom/telecom infrastructure markets. Their customers include
    some of the largest operators in these markets. In addition,
    many of the OEM customers of these companies within the
    Electronic Technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to
    Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) companies.
    Other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid
    manufacturers, many of the largest global EMS companies,
    particularly in China, and major printed circuit board and
    semi-conductor manufacturers.

Backlog

Backlog generally is not a significant long-term success factor
    in most of Dover’s businesses, as most of the products of
    Dover companies have relatively short

order-to-delivery

periods. It is more relevant to those businesses that produce
    larger and more sophisticated machines or have long-term
    government contracts, primarily in the Mobile Equipment platform
    within the Industrial Products segment, and in the testing
    equipment and components business in the Electronic Technologies
    segment. Total Company backlog as of December 31, 2007 and
    2006 was $1,385.7 million and $1,227.0 million,
    respectively.



Competition

Dover’s competitive environment is complex because of the
    wide diversity of the products its companies manufacture and the
    markets they serve. In general, most Dover companies are market
    leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key
    competitive factors are customer service, product quality and
    innovation. Dover companies usually have more significant
    competitors domestically, where their principal markets are,
    than in

non-U.S. markets;

however, Dover companies are becoming increasingly global where
    more competitors exist.

Certain companies in the Electronic Technologies and Engineered
    Systems segments compete globally against a variety of
    companies, primarily operating in Europe and the Far East.

International

For

non-U.S. revenue

and an allocation of the assets of the Company’s continuing
    operations, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Although international operations are subject to certain risks,
    such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and

non-U.S. governmental

restrictions, Dover continues to increase its expansion into
    international markets, including South America, Asia and Eastern
    Europe.

Most of Dover’s

non-U.S. subsidiaries

and affiliates are based in France, Germany, the United Kingdom,
    the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and, with increased
    emphasis, China, Malaysia, India, Mexico, Brazil and Eastern
    Europe.

Environmental
    Matters

Dover believes its companies’ operations generally are in
    substantial compliance with applicable regulations. In a few
    instances, particular plants and businesses have been the
    subject of administrative and legal proceedings with
    governmental agencies or private parties relating to the
    discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances. Where
    necessary, these matters have been addressed with specific
    consent orders to achieve compliance. Dover believes that
    continued compliance will not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial position and will not require
    significant expenditures or adjustments to reserves.

Employees

The Company had approximately 33,400 employees in
    continuing operations as of December 31, 2007.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Dover’s business, financial condition, operating results
    and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including
    but not limited to those set forth below, any one of which could
    cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results
    or from anticipated future results. For a discussion identifying
    additional risk factors and important factors that could cause
    actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see
    the discussion in “SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING
    FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Cyclical
    Economic Conditions May Affect the Company’s Financial
    Performance

A meaningful portion of the Company’s revenue, most notably
    that from the Electronic Technologies segment, is derived from
    companies that serve the global electronics markets, which are
    subject to unpredictable short-term business cycles. As a
    result, the revenue and operating performance of these companies
    in any one period are not



necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating
    performance in other periods, and could have a material impact
    on Dover’s consolidated financial position.

The Energy platform in the Fluid Management segment is subject
    to risk due to the volatility of energy prices, although overall
    demand is more directly related to depletion rates and rig
    counts.

In addition, Dover is subject to substantially the same risk
    factors as other

U.S.-based

industrial manufacturers. However, except as noted above, the
    structure of Dover and the many different markets its companies
    serve mitigates the possibility that any of these risk factors
    will materially impact Dover’s consolidated financial
    position.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal
    proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites
    identified under federal and state statutes which provide for
    the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible
    parties.” In each instance, the extent of the
    subsidiary’s liability appears to be very small in relation
    to the total projected expenditures and the number of other
    “potentially responsible parties” involved and is
    anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few
    of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing
    remedial activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with
    regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been
    established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are, and from time
    to time may become, parties to a number of other legal
    proceedings incidental to their businesses. These proceedings
    primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury
    arising out of use of products of Dover companies, exposure to
    hazardous substances or patent infringement, employment matters
    and commercial disputes. Management and legal counsel
    periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings,
    the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred, the
    availability and extent of insurance coverage, and established
    reserves. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of
    these legal actions or any need for additional reserves, in the
    opinion of management, based on these reviews, it is unlikely
    that the disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters
    mentioned above will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash
    flows or competitive position.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Management assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its
    ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and
    financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity
    are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital
    expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchases
    of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper
    and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term
    capital with satisfactory terms. The Company generates
    substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong
    financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for
    reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions
    while managing its capital structure on a short and long-term
    basis.

Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2007
    increased $35.9 million over the prior year primarily
    reflecting higher earnings from continuing operations before
    depreciation and amortization partially offset by higher
    incentive compensation, interest and tax payments.

Cash used in investing activities during 2007 decreased
    $510.2 million compared to 2006, reflecting lower
    acquisition spending and capital expenditures, partially offset
    by lower proceeds from the disposition of businesses during 2007
    compared to 2006. Acquisition expenditures in 2007 were
    $273.6 million compared to $1,116.8 million in 2006,
    while proceeds from the disposition of businesses were
    $91.0 million, down $354.9 million from
    $445.9 million in 2006. Capital expenditures of
    $174.3 million decreased from $190.7 million in the
    prior year, and primarily funded investments in plant
    expansions, plant machinery and information systems. The Company
    currently anticipates that any acquisitions made during 2008
    will be funded from available cash and internally generated
    funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial
    paper, established lines of credit or public debt markets.
    Capital expenditures for 2008 are generally expected to be at or
    below 2007 levels.

Cash used in financing activities during 2007 totaled
    $345.7 million compared to cash provided by financing
    activities of $128.3 million in the 2006 period. The change
    in financing activity during 2007 primarily reflected cash used
    to purchase 12.4 million shares of Dover common stock on
    the open market, under its share repurchase program, throughout
    2007 for a total of $591 million. A portion of these shares
    were acquired through an accelerated share repurchase agreement
    (“ASR”) under which the Company, during the third
    quarter of 2007, purchased 6 million shares of its common
    stock at an initial purchase price of $51.64 per share. Upon
    settlement of this ASR in the fourth quarter of 2007, the final
    economic purchase price was $48.36 per share, representing an
    average of the volume weighted average price of the
    Company’s common stock during the outstanding period less a
    negotiated discount amount. The 2007 share repurchases were
    funded through cash from operations, proceeds from the
    disposition of businesses and an increase in outstanding
    commercial paper borrowings.



Adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as
    accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable)
    increased from the prior year end by $29.1 million, or 2%,
    to $1,363.0 million which reflected an increase in
    receivables of $57.4 million, a decrease in inventory of
    $13.0 million and an increase in accounts payable of
    $15.3 million. Excluding acquisitions and the effects of
    foreign exchange translation, adjusted working capital would
    have decreased by $50.1 million, or 4%. Average annual
    adjusted working capital as a percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP
    measure calculated as the five-quarter average balance of
    accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable
    divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue) increased
    slightly to 19.2% at December 31, 2007 from 19.0% at
    December 31, 2006.

In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage
    based upon the operating, investing and financing
    classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows, the Company also measures free cash flow (a non-GAAP
    measure). Management believes that free cash flow is an
    important measure of operating performance because it provides
    both management and investors a measurement of cash generated
    from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay
    dividends, repay debt and repurchase Dover’s common stock.
    For further information, see Non-GAAP Disclosures at the
    end of this Item 7.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2007 was
    $727.7 million or 10.1% of revenue compared to
    $675.4 million or 10.7% of revenue in the prior year. The
    2007 increase in free cash flow reflected higher earnings from
    continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and
    lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher tax
    payments in 2007. The following table is a reconciliation of
    free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities:

At December 31, 2007, the Company’s net property,
    plant, and equipment totaled $885.1 million compared to
    $815.2 million at the end of 2006. The increase in net
    property, plant and equipment reflected capital expenditures of
    $174.3 million, acquisitions of $27.0 million and
    $25.0 million related to foreign currency fluctuations,
    partially offset by depreciation and disposals.

The aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities decreased from a $268.5 million net liability
    at the beginning of the year to a net liability of
    $238.6 million at year-end 2007. This resulted primarily
    from an increase in deferred tax assets arising from accrued
    expenses, principally for state income taxes, and a decrease in
    deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets.

Dover’s consolidated benefit obligation related to defined
    and supplemental retirement benefits decreased by
    $31.0 million in 2007. The decrease was due primarily to
    actuarial gains, benefits paid and plan amendments, offset by
    benefits earned, interest cost and currency rate changes. In
    2007, plan assets increased $18.8 million primarily due to
    gains on plan investments during the year and company
    contributions, partially offset by benefits paid. It is
    estimated that the Company’s defined and supplemental
    retirement benefits expense will decrease from
    $49.5 million in 2007 to approximately $38.3 million
    in 2008.

The Company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization
    calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess its overall financial
    leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to
    investors for the same reason. The

    capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:

The total debt level of $2,090.7 million at
    December 31, 2007 increased $319.6 million from
    December 31, 2006 due to increased commercial paper
    borrowings used to fund the Company’s ASR program and other
    open market purchases of its common stock. Net debt at
    December 31, 2007 increased $92 million as a result of
    the total debt increase, partially offset by an increase in cash
    generated from operations. The percentage increase in net debt
    to total capital, after $591 million of share repurchases,
    reflects strong operational free cash flow and proceeds from
    dispositions of $91 million.

Dover’s long-term debt instruments had a book value of
    $1,485.2 million on December 31, 2007 and a fair value
    of approximately $1,496.0 million. On December 31,
    2006, the Company’s long-term debt instruments had a book
    value of $1,512.8 million and a fair value of approximately
    $1,502.9 million.

The Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are
    adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable
    risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future.
    Acquisition spending

and/or

share
    repurchases could potentially increase Company debt. However,
    management anticipates that the net debt to total capitalization
    ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels.
    Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected
    to satisfy the Company’s various cash flow requirements,
    including acquisitions and capital expenditures.

Management is not aware of any potential impairment to the
    Company’s liquidity, and the Company is in compliance with
    all of its long-term debt covenants. It is anticipated that in
    2008 any funding requirements above cash generated from
    operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper
    and, depending upon market conditions, through the issuance of
    long-term debt.

As of December 31, 2007, there were two interest rate swap
    agreements outstanding for a total notional amount of
    $100.0 million designated as fair value hedges on part of
    the Company’s $400.0 million 6.50% Notes due on
    February 15, 2011. One $50 million interest rate swap
    exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest. The
    other $50 million swap is designated in foreign currency
    and exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest,
    and also hedges a portion of the Company’s net investment
    in international operations. The swap agreements have reduced
    the effective interest rate on the notes to 6.43%. There is no
    hedge ineffectiveness, and the fair value of the interest rate
    swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2007 was determined
    through market quotation.



At December 31, 2007, the Company had open foreign exchange
    forward purchase contracts expiring through February 2008

Severance
    and Exit Reserves

From time to time, the Company will initiate various
    restructuring programs at its operating companies or record
    severance and exit costs in connection with purchase accounting
    for acquisitions. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company had reserves related to severance and exit activities of
    $28.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively. During
    2007, the Company recorded $12.8 million in purchase
    accounting reserves related to acquisitions, made
    $9.7 million in payments and recorded additional charges of
    $1.9 million.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS:

    COMPARED TO 2006

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 14%
    over 2006, due to increases of $473.1 million at Engineered
    Systems, $294.8 million at Industrial Products and
    $152.4 million at Fluid Management. These revenue increases
    were due to positive market fundamentals and acquisitions, while
    Electronic Technologies’ revenue decreased
    $21.5 million due to weakness in its markets. Overall,
    Dover’s organic revenue growth was 2.3%, acquisition growth
    was 9.7% and the impact from foreign exchange was 2.1%. Gross
    profit increased 14% to $2,621.7 million from 2006 while
    the gross profit margin remained essentially flat at 36.3% and
    36.5%, respectively.

Selling and administrative expenses of $1,641.0 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 increased
    $230.3 million over the comparable 2006 period, primarily
    due to increased revenue activity and increases in compensation
    and pension benefit costs.

Interest expense, net, increased 16% to $89.0 million for
    2007, compared to $77.0 million for 2006 due to higher
    average outstanding borrowings used to fund purchases of the
    Company’s common stock and average commercial paper rates.

Other expense (income), net for 2007 and 2006 of
    $4.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively, was
    driven primarily by foreign exchange losses, partially offset by
    other miscellaneous income.

The 2007 and 2006 tax rates for continuing operations were
    26.4%, and 26.8%, respectively. Both periods were favorably
    impacted by the mix of

non-U.S. earnings

in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions.

Earnings from continuing operations for 2007 were
    $653.3 million or $3.22 per diluted share compared to
    $592.5 million or $2.88 per diluted share in 2006. For
    2007, net earnings were $661.1 million, or $3.26 per
    diluted share, which included $7.8 million, or $0.04 per
    diluted share, of income from discontinued operations, compared
    to $561.8 million, or $2.73 per diluted share for 2006,
    which included a $30.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share,
    loss from discontinued operations. Refer to Note 8 in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
    discontinued operations.

Industrial Products’ revenue and earnings increases over
    the prior year were primarily the result of the acquisition of
    Paladin in August 2006 and the July 2007 acquisition of
    Hanmecson International, a Chinese manufacturer of vehicle
    lifts. For the year, the segment achieved 2% organic growth,
    while growth from acquisitions and the impact of foreign
    exchange accounted for 12% and 1%, respectively.

Material Handling revenue increased 36% while earnings increased
    28% compared to the prior year. The increases were primarily due
    to the Paladin acquisition and improvements in the heavy winch,
    recreational vehicle and industrial automation businesses.
    Margin was impacted by the slowdown in the heavy construction
    business producing attachments and cylinders. In addition, the
    platform benefited from new product introductions, plant
    rationalization and global sourcing during 2007.

Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings increased 3% and 8%,
    respectively, over the prior year. The platform’s results
    benefited from the Hanmecson acquisition and core growth at
    businesses in the petroleum, crude oil and military markets, as
    well as a $5.3 million net pre-tax gain on the sale of a
    facility in the second quarter of 2007. However, softness
    experienced in the automotive service industry and the aerospace
    service business partially offset these gains.

Engineered Systems’ revenue and earnings increases over the
    prior year reflect the December 2006 acquisition of Markem and
    the May 2006 acquisition of O’Neil. Revenue growth due to
    acquisitions was 19%. However, most core businesses also
    improved as the segment achieved organic revenue growth of 7%,
    with the remainder due to the impact of foreign exchange. The
    decrease in operating margin was due to weakness in the ATM
    business.

Engineered Products’ revenue and earnings increased 12% and
    5%, respectively, over the prior year due to strong supermarket
    and heat exchanger markets; offset by weakness in the ATM
    business which negatively impacted the revenue and earnings
    increases. Sequentially, revenue and earnings in the fourth
    quarter of 2007 were down 8% and 19%, respectively, reflecting
    normal seasonality and a slowdown in retail food equipment
    demand, along with reduced orders tied to high customer
    inventory levels in the heat exchanger business.

The Product Identification platform had revenue and earnings
    increases of 61% and 41%, respectively, during 2007 mostly
    reflecting the 2006 acquisitions of Markem and O’Neil.
    Overall, the revenue growth due to the 2006 acquisitions was
    55%, while organic growth was 3% due to growth in the core
    direct coding business with the remainder due to foreign
    exchange.

Fluid Management’s revenue and earnings increases were the
    result of strength at all businesses in the segment. The segment
    continued to benefit from strong results from the Energy
    platform which serves the oil, gas and power generation markets.
    As a result, the segment achieved organic growth of 9%, with the
    remainder primarily from foreign exchange.

The Energy platform’s revenue and earnings increased 13%
    and 15%, respectively, primarily due to strong oil and gas
    markets and increased power generation demand throughout 2007.
    The platform’s earnings growth further benefited from
    higher volume, productivity gains and operational improvements.

Fluid Solutions revenue and earnings both increased 10% when
    compared to the prior year due to improvements at all core
    businesses in the platform. Throughout 2007, the platform
    experienced strong demand in the chemical and rail markets.
    Overall, the platform had organic revenue growth of 6%, growth
    from acquisitions of 2%, with the reminder due to foreign
    exchange.

Electronic Technologies’

year-over-year

decreases in revenue and earnings were primarily due to softness
    in the semi-conductor end markets throughout 2007 compared to
    strong markets experienced in the prior year. The medical and
    military/space markets were strong throughout the year, while
    telecom markets remained flat. Overall, the increase in revenue
    due to acquisitions and foreign exchange were each 3%, while
    organic revenue decreased 8%.

    COMPARED TO 2005

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 23%
    over 2005 due to increases at all four segments led by increases
    of $470.1 million at Electronic Technologies and
    $269.4 million at Engineered Systems. The Electronic
    Technologies’ and Engineered Systems’ revenue
    increased due to acquisitions and strong organic growth.
    Overall, Dover’s organic revenue growth was 14%,
    acquisition growth was 9% and the impact from foreign exchange
    was negligible. Gross profit increased 26% to
    $2,308.6 million while the gross profit margin increased
    80 basis points to 36.5%.

Selling and administrative expenses of $1,410.7 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 increased
    $227.0 million over the comparable 2005 period, primarily
    due to increased revenue activity and $26.1 million of
    equity compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standard 123(R), “Share Based
    Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which
    requires companies to expense the fair value of equity
    compensation, such as stock options and stock appreciation
    rights (“SARs”), primarily over the related vesting
    period. The Company used the modified prospective method to
    adopt SFAS No. 123(R), which did not require the
    restatement of prior periods. Selling and administrative
    expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 22.3% from
    23.1% in 2005. Excluding the effect of
    SFAS No. 123(R), selling and administrative expenses
    during the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been
    $1,384.6 million or 21.9% of revenue.

Interest expense, net, increased 7% to $77.0 million for
    2006, compared to $72.2 million for 2005 due to higher
    average outstanding borrowings and average commercial paper
    rates.

Other expense (income), net for 2006 of $11.4 million was
    driven primarily by foreign exchange losses. Other expense
    (income), net of ($12.7) million for 2005 included foreign
    exchange gains of $7.8 million.

The 2006 tax rate for continuing operations was 26.8%,
    reflecting the effect of the full year retroactive extension of
    the U.S. federal research credit, a favorable mix of

non-U.S. earnings

in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions, a lower relative
    U.S. federal tax exclusion for

non-U.S. sales

in 2006 and the inclusion of a $7.8 million net benefit
    primarily related to the resolution of a state income tax issue.
    The 2005 tax rate for continuing operations of 26.5% included a
    $9.5 million provision related to the repatriation of
    $373.7 million of dividends and a $25.5 million
    benefit primarily related to the resolution of U.S. tax
    issues and a $5.5 million benefit related to a favorable
    federal tax court decision. Excluding the repatriation
    provision, the full year 2005 tax rate for continuing operations
    was 24.9%.



Earnings from continuing operations for 2006 were
    $592.5 million or $2.88 per diluted share, compared to
    $432.5 million or $2.12 per diluted share in 2005. For
    2006, net earnings were $561.8 million, or $2.73 diluted
    share, which included a $30.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted
    share, loss from discontinued operations, compared to
    $510.1 million, or $2.50 per diluted share for 2005, which
    included $77.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in
    earnings from discontinued operations. Refer to Note 8 in
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
    on discontinued operations.

Industrial Products revenue and earnings increased over the
    prior year as a result of the August 2006 acquisition of Paladin
    and strength in the energy, military and commercial
    transportation markets as well as in the heavy winch business.
    Margin declined due to purchase accounting amortization related
    to the Paladin acquisition. Overall, the segment had organic
    revenue growth of 5% during the year, with the remainder
    primarily from acquisitions.

Material Handling revenue increased primarily due to the Paladin
    acquisition and continued growth in the heavy winch business,
    partially offset by softness in the automotive and recreational
    vehicle markets. Earnings increased 12% as the margin was
    impacted by the weak automotive, light construction and
    recreational vehicle markets.

Mobile Equipment revenue increased reflecting strength in the
    commercial transportation market. However, these improvements
    were negatively impacted by weakness in the North American
    automotive service industry.



Earnings increased 11% driven by volume and improved leverage.
    In addition, prior year earnings were positively impacted by a
    gain of approximately $1 million on the sale of a facility.

Engineered Systems revenue and earnings increases over the prior
    year reflect the relative strength of the segment’s markets
    during 2006. The slight decrease in operating margin was due to
    higher costs in the Engineered Products platform. The segment
    achieved organic growth of 14% with the remainder primarily from
    acquisitions.

Engineered Products revenue and earnings increased 19% and 17%,
    respectively, over the prior year due to the robust heat
    exchanger market and positive demand for supermarket,
    foodservice, can necking, and packaging closure equipment. These
    improvements were partially offset by weakness in the ATM
    business. The platform’s margins were impacted by increased
    commodity costs and temporary cost inefficiencies related to
    higher production levels in the food equipment business.

Product Identification revenue increased 21% and earnings
    increased 37% over the prior year, reflecting successful results
    from all product lines and regions as well as the impact of the
    Markem and O’Neil acquisitions which contributed 12% to the
    group’s revenue growth for the year.

Fluid Management revenue, earnings and bookings increased
    primarily as a result of improvements in the Energy platform and
    the third quarter 2005 acquisition of Colder Products. Strong
    results in the Energy platform contributed to the margin
    increase, partially offset by slightly weaker margins in the
    Fluid Solutions platform. Overall, the segment had organic
    revenue growth of 19% during the year with the remainder
    primarily from acquisitions.

The Energy platform delivered strong results throughout 2006
    with revenue and earnings increases of 35% and 50%,
    respectively, over the prior year. Commodity pricing for oil and
    gas began moderating in the second quarter of 2006; however,
    strong activity in exploration, production and drilling
    continued to drive the positive 2006 results. The group
    continued to add capacity judiciously to meet increasing levels
    of demand.

Fluid Solutions revenue and earnings increased 15% and 12%,
    respectively, due to improvements in mobile transport equipment,
    global demand for retail petroleum equipment and support
    equipment for the growing ethanol business and the acquisition
    of Colder Products. Product mix had a negative impact on
    earnings.

The increases in revenue and earnings in the Electronic
    Technologies segment compared to the prior year were due to the
    third quarter 2005 acquisition of Knowles Electronics and
    organic growth of 26% for the year. Although the semiconductor
    market moderated in the fourth quarter of 2006, the segment
    continued to exhibit strong fundamentals based on levels of
    recurring revenue and the overall strength of the consumer
    electronics industry. In addition, the core components business
    showed strength in the frequency control and micro acoustics
    markets.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The Company’s consolidated financial statements and related
    public financial information are based on the application of
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates,
    assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of
    accounting principles that have an impact on the assets,
    liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These
    estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in
    the public disclosures of the Company, including information
    regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The
    Company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting
    assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied.
    Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on
    a consistent basis throughout the Company. Primary areas where
    the financial information of Dover is subject to the use of
    estimates, assumptions and the application of judgment include
    the following areas:

•

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances
    are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, b) price is fixed or determinable,
    c) collectability is reasonably assured, and
    d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where
    installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the
    installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of
    the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving
    non-essential installation obligations are those which can
    generally be completed in a short period of time at
    insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these
    installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases
    can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the
    installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the
    delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until
    installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined
    that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the
    Company will allocate consideration received to the separate
    deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize
    revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable
    identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other
    post shipment obligations such as training and customer
    acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is
    deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance
    has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned
    when services are performed.

•

Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual
    operating companies based on estimates of losses related to
    customer receivable balances. Estimates are developed by using
    standard quantitative measures based on historical losses,
    adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases,
    evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The
    establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and
    assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable
    balances. Due to the fact that Dover operates in many different
    markets, changes in economic conditions in specific markets
    generally should not have a material effect on reserve balances
    required.



•

Inventory for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries,
    including all international subsidiaries are stated at the lower
    of cost, determined on the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is
    stated at cost, determined on the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under
    certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the
    valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly
    value inventory. The Electronic Technologies companies tend to
    experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations,
    particularly given the relatively high rate of product
    obsolescence over relatively short periods of time.

•

Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves
    at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting
    principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs,
    require the use of estimates. Though Dover believes that these
    estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual
    results may be different than the estimated amounts.

•

Dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its
    balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles
    related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of
    these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and
    amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of
    estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established
    accounting guidelines (including
    SFAS No. 142) for impairment also requires
    significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it
    relates to the identification of reporting units and the
    determination of fair market value. Dover’s assets and
    reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an
    annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of
    impairment exist. The Company believes that its use of estimates
    and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally
    accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions
    could potentially require adjustments to the valuations.

•

The valuation of Dover’s pension and other post-retirement
    plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are
    used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and
    assets/liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates,
    investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and
    mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in Dover’s
    pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with
    external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for
    Dover’s future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions
    and future investment returns could potentially have a material
    impact on Dover’s pension expenses and related funding
    requirements. Dover’s expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns,
    economic trends and portfolio allocation. Dover’s discount
    rate assumption is determined by constructing a portfolio of
    bonds to match the expected benefit stream to be paid from the
    Company’s pension plans. The benefit payment stream is
    assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities, as well
    as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio.

•

Dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are
    reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets
    are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income
    streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are
    also estimated, using a more likely than not criteria, for
    ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues
    that are currently unresolved. The Company routinely monitors
    the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is
    properly reserved. Valuations related to tax accruals and assets
    can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in
    tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and the
    Company’s future taxable income levels.

•

Dover has significant accruals and reserves related to the self
    insured portion of its risk management program. These accruals
    require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk
    exposure and ultimate liability. The Company estimates losses
    under these programs using actuarial assumptions, Dover’s
    experience, and relevant industry data. Dover reviews these
    factors quarterly and considers the current level of accruals
    and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and
    Company experience.

•

Dover has established reserves for environmental and legal
    contingencies at both the operating company and corporate
    levels. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is
    required to quantify Dover’s ultimate exposure in these
    matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed
    on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to
    assure that Dover is properly reserved. Reserve balances are
    adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing
    issues and the establishment of additional



reserves for emerging issues. While Dover believes that the
    current level of reserves is adequate, future changes in
    circumstances could impact these determinations.

•

The Company from time to time will discontinue certain
    operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if
    necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations
    to their estimated fair market value less costs to sell. These
    estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds
    anticipated as a result of the sale. The adjustments to fair
    market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain
    or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the
    inability to sell an operation could potentially require future
    adjustments to these estimates.

•

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate
    the fair value of its Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) and stock
    options that are granted to employees. The model requires
    management to estimate the expected life of the SAR or option,
    expected forfeitures and the volatility of Dover’s stock
    using historical data. For additional information related to the
    assumptions used, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

New
    Accounting Standards

Effective December 31, 2006, Dover adopted
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”).
    SFAS No. 158 requires companies to report the funded
    status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans on their balance sheets as a net liability or
    asset. Upon adoption at December 31, 2006, Dover recorded a
    net reduction to stockholders’ equity of
    $123.5 million, net of tax. In addition, effective for
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, the new
    standard will require companies to measure benefit obligations
    and plan assets as of a Company’s fiscal year end
    (December 31, 2008 for Dover), using one of the methods
    prescribed in the standard. Dover expects to adopt the new
    valuation date requirements using the

15-month

alternative, as prescribed in the standard, which will result in
    a charge of approximately $10.0 million to retained
    earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Effective January 1, 2007, Dover adopted FASB
    Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). See Note 2 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for additional information on the adoption of this standard.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”
    (“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
    accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. For financial assets and
    liabilities, this statement is effective for fiscal periods
    beginning after November 15, 2007 and does not require any
    new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB Staff
    Position

No. 157-2

was issued which delayed the effective date of FASB Statement
    No. 157 to fiscal years ending after November 15, 2008
    for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that
    are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The Company
    does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a
    material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” This statement permits entities to choose to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value. This statement is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
    including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company
    will not elect the fair value option for any of its existing
    financial instruments as of January 1, 2008 and the Company
    has not determined whether or not it will elect this option for
    financial instruments it may acquire in the future.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 requires that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity
    and the amount of consolidated net income specifically
    attributable to the noncontrolling interest be identified in the
    consolidated financial statements. It also requires consistency
    in the manner of reporting changes in the parent’s
    ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any



noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation.
    The Company will apply the provisions of this statement
    prospectively, as required, beginning on January 1, 2009
    and does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a
    material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007), “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) retains the
    fundamental requirements in Statement 141 that the acquisition
    method of accounting (which Statement 141 called the purchase
    method) be used for all business combinations and for an
    acquirer to be identified for each business combination. In
    general, the statement (1) broadens the guidance of
    SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all events where
    one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses,
    (2) broadens the use of fair value measurements used to
    recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
    (3) changes the accounting for acquisition related fees and
    restructuring costs incurred in connection with an acquisition
    and (4) increases required disclosures. The Company will
    apply the provisions of this statement prospectively to business
    combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after
    January 1, 2009 and is currently assessing the impact of
    adoption of SFAS 141(R) on its consolidated financial
    statements.

Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information
    regarding the Company’s results as determined by generally
    accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company also
    discloses non-GAAP information which management believes
    provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net
    debt, total debt, total capitalization, adjusted working
    capital, average annual adjusted working capital, revenues
    excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures
    under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash
    flows from operating activities, debt or equity, revenue and
    working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they
    may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by
    other companies. Management believes the (1) net debt to
    total capitalization ratio and (2) free cash flow are
    important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net
    debt to total capitalization is helpful in evaluating the
    Company’s capital structure and the amount of leverage it
    employs. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a
    measurement of cash generated from operations that is available
    to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase
    the Company’s common stock. Reconciliations of free cash
    flow, total debt and net debt can be found above in this
    Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
    Management believes that reporting adjusted working capital
    (also sometimes called “working capital”), which is
    calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts
    payable, provides a meaningful measure of the Company’s
    operational results by showing the changes caused solely by
    revenue. Management believes that reporting adjusted working
    capital and revenues at constant currency, which excludes the
    positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of the
    Company’s operational changes, given the global nature of
    Dover’s businesses. Management believes that reporting
    organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign
    currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions, provides
    a useful comparison of the Company’s revenue performance
    and trends between periods.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rates

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in
    interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of long-term
    fixed interest rate debt, interest rate swaps attached thereto,
    commercial paper borrowings and investments in cash equivalents.
    Generally, the fair market value of fixed-interest rate debt
    will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest
    rates rise. A 54 basis point increase or decrease in
    interest rates (10% of the Company’s weighted average
    long-term debt interest rate) would have an immaterial effect on
    the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt. Commercial
    paper borrowings are at variable interest rates, and have
    maturities of three months or less. A 51 basis point
    increase or decrease in the interest rates (10% of the
    Company’s weighted average commercial paper interest rate)
    on commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial impact
    on the Company’s pre-tax earnings. All highly liquid
    investments, including highly liquid debt instruments purchased
    with an original maturity of three months or less, are
    considered cash equivalents. The Company places its investments
    in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limits
    the amount of exposure to any one issuer. A 50 basis point
    decrease or increase in interest rates (10% of the
    Company’s weighted average interest rate) would have an



immaterial impact on the Company’s pre-tax income. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company had two interest rate swaps
    outstanding, as discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. The Company does not enter into derivative
    financial or derivative commodity instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes.

Foreign
    Exchange

The Company conducts business in various

non-U.S. countries,

primarily in Canada, Mexico, substantially all of the European
    countries, Brazil, Argentina, Malaysia, China, India and other
    Asian countries. Therefore, changes in the value of the
    currencies of these countries affect the Company’s
    financial position and cash flows when translated into
    U.S. Dollars. The Company has generally accepted the
    exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment
    in

non-U.S. operations.

The Company may, from time to time, for a specific exposure,
    enter into fair value hedges. Certain individual operating
    companies that have foreign exchange exposure have established
    formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair
    value

and/or

cash flow hedging. The Company has mitigated and will continue
    to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation
    of

non-U.S. operating

companies in which the majority of all costs are local-currency
    based. A change of 10% or less in the value of all foreign
    currencies would not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position and cash flows.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

.

Based on its assessment under the criteria set forth in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

,
    management concluded that, as of December 31, 2007, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles.

In making its assessment of internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, management has excluded
    those companies acquired in purchase business combinations
    during 2007, which included Biode, Pole/Zero Corporation, Theta
    Oilfield Services, Hanmecson International, Griswold Pump,
    Windrock Inc. and Industrial Motion Control LLC. These companies
    are wholly-owned by the Company and their total revenue for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 represents approximately 1% of
    the Company’s consolidated total revenue for the same
    period and their assets represent approximately 4% of the
    Company’s consolidated assets as of December 31, 2007.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
    herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Dover Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of Dover Corporation and its subsidiaries
    at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007 based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in “Management’s Report
    on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” appearing
    under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
    these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule,
    and on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
    audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
    material misstatement and whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain income tax positions in 2007 and share-based
    compensation and defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement obligations in 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



As described in “Management’s Report of Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting,” management has excluded
    Biode, Pole/Zero Corporation, Theta Oilfield Services, Hanmecson
    International, Griswold Pump, Windrock Inc. and Industrial
    Motion Control LLC from its assessment of internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 because they
    were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations
    during 2007. We have also excluded Biode, Pole/Zero Corporation,
    Theta Oilfield Services, Hanmecson International, Griswold Pump,
    Windrock Inc. and Industrial Motion Control LLC from our audit
    of internal control over financial reporting. These companies
    are wholly owned by the Company and their total revenue and
    assets represent approximately 1% and 4% of the Company’s
    consolidated total revenue and assets, respectively, as
    reflected in its financial statements as of and for the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

Description
    of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Description
    of Business

Dover Corporation (“Dover” or the “Company”)
    is a diversified, multinational manufacturing corporation
    comprised of operating companies which manufacture a broad range
    of specialized industrial products and components as well as
    related services and consumables. The Company also provides
    engineering, testing and other similar services, which are not
    significant in relation to consolidated revenue. Dover’s
    operating companies are based primarily in the United States of
    America and Europe with manufacturing and other operations
    throughout the world. The Company reports its results in four
    segments, Industrial Products, Engineered Systems, Fluid
    Management and Electronic Technologies. For additional
    information on Dover’s segments, see Note 14.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
    The results of operations of purchased businesses are included
    from the dates of acquisitions. The assets, liabilities, results
    of operations and cash flows of all discontinued operations have
    been separately reported as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented. Certain amounts in prior years have been
    reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include
    allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, net realizable
    value of inventories, restructuring charges, valuation of
    goodwill and intangible assets, pension and post retirement
    assumptions, useful lives associated with amortization and
    depreciation of intangibles and fixed assets, warranty reserves,
    income taxes and tax valuation reserves, environmental reserves,
    legal reserves, insurance reserves and the valuations of
    discontinued assets and liabilities.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits
    and short-term investments which are highly liquid in nature and
    have original maturities at the time of purchase of three months
    or less.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable is composed principally of trade accounts
    receivable that arise primarily from the sale of goods or
    services on account and are stated at historical cost.
    Management at each operating company evaluates accounts
    receivable to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that
    will not be collected in the future and records the appropriate
    provision. The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a
    charge to operating expense and reduces accounts receivable. The
    estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based primarily on
    management’s evaluation of the aging of the accounts
    receivable balance, the financial condition of its customers,
    historical trends and the time outstanding of specific balances.
    Actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from
    management’s estimates due to changes in future economic,
    industry or customers’ financial conditions.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade
    receivables, accounts payable, notes payable and accrued
    expenses approximates fair value due to the short maturity, less
    than one year, of these instruments.



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories

Inventories for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries,
    including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the
    lower of cost, determined on the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is
    stated at cost, determined on the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment includes the historic cost of
    land, buildings, equipment and significant improvements to
    existing plant and equipment or in the case of acquisitions, a
    fair market value appraisal of such assets completed at the time
    of acquisition. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor
    renewals are expensed as incurred. When property or equipment is
    sold or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
    depreciation is removed from the respective accounts and the
    gain or loss realized on disposition is reflected in earnings.
    Depreciation expense was $150.4 million in 2007,
    $126.8 million in 2006, and $106.6 million in 2005 and
    was calculated on a straight-line basis for all periods
    presented. The Company depreciates its assets over their
    estimated useful lives as follows: buildings, 5 to
    31.5 years; machinery and equipment 3 to 7 years;
    furniture and fixtures 3 to 7 years; and vehicles
    3 years.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company periodically enters into fair value and cash flow
    hedge transactions specifically to hedge its exposures to
    various items, including but not limited to interest rate and
    foreign exchange rate risk. The Company does not enter into
    derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and
    does not have a material portfolio of derivative financial
    instruments.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” and related amendments
    and interpretations, the Company recognizes all derivatives as
    either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures
    those instruments at fair value. If the derivative is designated
    as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair
    value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to
    the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period.
    If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portions of changes in the fair value of the
    derivative are recorded in other comprehensive earnings and are
    recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item
    affects income. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair
    value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

Tests for hedge ineffectiveness are conducted periodically and
    any ineffectiveness found is recognized in the statement of
    operations. The fair market value of all outstanding
    transactions is recorded in the Other assets and deferred
    charges, or Other deferrals section of the balance sheet, as
    applicable. The corresponding change in value of the hedged
    assets/liabilities is recorded directly in that section of the
    balance sheet.

During 2006, the Company entered into derivative contracts to
    hedge potential foreign currency exposure on current assets and
    liabilities. The contracts were designated as fair value hedges
    and were considered by management to be highly effective. The
    derivative foreign exchange contracts settled during 2006 and
    resulted in a gain of approximately $0.6 million, which is
    recognized in Revenue and Other Expense (Income), net.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses
    over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,” the Company does not amortize goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Instead, these assets
    are tested for impairment annually unless indicators of
    impairment exist during the interim periods. For 2007 and 2006,
    the Company identified 11 and 16 reporting units, respectively,
    for testing purposes. Step one of the test compared the fair
    value of the reporting unit (using a discounted cash flow
    method) to its book value. Step two, which compares the book
    value of the goodwill to its implied fair value, was not
    necessary since there were no indicators of potential impairment
    from step one. For information related to the amount of the
    Company’s goodwill by segment and intangible asset classes,
    see Note 7.

Long-Lived
    Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” long
    -lived assets (including intangible assets that are amortized)
    are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. If an indicator of impairment exists for any
    grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash
    flows is produced and compared to its carrying value. If an
    asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the
    excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value
    as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.

Foreign
    Currency

Assets and liabilities of

non-U.S. subsidiaries,

where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have
    been translated at year-end exchange rates and profit and loss
    accounts have been translated using weighted average yearly
    exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from translation have been
    recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as
    cumulative translation adjustments. Assets and liabilities of an
    entity that are denominated in currencies other than an
    entity’s functional currency are remeasured into the
    functional currency using end of period exchange rates or
    historical rates where applicable to certain balances. Gains and
    losses related to these remeasurements are recorded within the
    Statement of Operations as a component of Other Expense
    (Income), net.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances
    are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, b) price is fixed or determinable,
    c) collectability is reasonably assured, and
    d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where
    installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the
    installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of
    the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving
    non-essential installation obligations are those which can
    generally be completed in a short period of time at
    insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these
    installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases
    can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the
    installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the
    delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until
    installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined
    that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the
    Company will allocate



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

consideration received to the separate deliverables based on
    their relative fair values and recognize revenue based on the
    appropriate criteria for each deliverable identified. In a
    limited number of revenue transactions, other post-shipment
    obligations such as training and customer acceptance are
    required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is deferred until
    the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance has been
    confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned when
    services are performed and is not significant to any period
    presented.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Prior to 2006, Dover accounted for stock-based compensation in
    accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
    Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,” and followed the disclosure only provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation.” Accordingly, no compensation expense was
    recognized in the Company’s 2005 Statement of Operations in
    connection with stock-based compensation granted to employees.

Effective January 1, 2006, Dover adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standard No. 123(R), “Share Based
    Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which no
    longer permits the use of the intrinsic value method under APB
    No. 25. The Company used the modified prospective method to
    adopt SFAS No. 123(R), which requires compensation
    expense to be recorded for all stock-based compensation granted
    on or after January 1, 2006, as well as the unvested
    portion of previously granted options. The Company is recording
    the compensation expense on a straight-line basis, generally
    over the explicit service period of three years (except for
    retirement eligible employees and retirees). Prior to adoption,
    the Company calculated its pro-forma footnote disclosure related
    to stock-based compensation using the explicit service period
    for all employees, and will continue to vest those awards over
    their explicit service period. Concurrent with the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), the Company changed its accounting
    policy for awards granted after January 1, 2006 to expense
    immediately awards granted to retirement eligible employees and
    to shorten the vesting period for any employee who will become
    eligible to retire within the three-year explicit service
    period. Expense for these employees will be recorded over the
    period from the date of grant through the date the employee
    first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to
    provide service.

For additional information related to stock-based compensation,
    including activity for 2007, 2006 and 2005, see Note 10.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes on continuing operations includes
    federal, state, local and

non-U.S. taxes.

Tax credits, primarily for research and experimentation and

non-U.S. earnings

and export programs, are recognized as a reduction of the
    provision for income taxes on continuing operations in the year
    in which they are available for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are
    provided on temporary differences between assets and liabilities
    for financial and tax reporting purposes as measured by enacted
    tax rates expected to apply when temporary differences are
    settled or realized. Future tax benefits are recognized to the
    extent that realization of those benefits is considered to be
    more likely than not. A valuation allowance is established for
    deferred tax assets for which realization is not assured. The
    Company has not provided for any residual U.S. income taxes
    on unremitted earnings of

non-U.S. subsidiaries

as such earnings are currently intended to be indefinitely
    reinvested.

During 2005, the Company recorded a net U.S. tax provision
    of $9.5 million related to the repatriation of
    $373.7 million of

non-U.S. dividends

under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,
    which provides for a favorable income tax rate on repatriated
    earnings, provided the criteria of the law are met.

See Note 2 below for a discussion of the impact of
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”).

Research
    and Development Costs

Research and development expenditures, including qualifying
    engineering costs, are expensed when incurred and amounted to
    $212.6 million in 2007, $155.0 million in 2006 and
    $144.7 million in 2005.

    CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Risk,
    Retention, Insurance

The Company’s property and casualty insurance programs
    contain various deductibles that, based on the Company’s
    experience, are typical and customary for a company of its size
    and risk profile. The Company does not consider any of the
    deductibles to represent a material risk to the Company. The
    Company generally maintains deductibles for claims and
    liabilities related primarily to workers’ compensation,
    health and welfare claims, general commercial, product and
    automobile liability and property damage, and business
    interruption resulting from certain events. The Company accrues
    for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be
    reasonably estimated. As part of the Company’s risk
    management program, insurance is maintained to transfer risk
    beyond the level of self-retention and provides protection on
    both an individual claim and annual aggregate basis. The Company
    currently self-insures its product and commercial general
    liability claims up to $5.0 million per occurrence, its
    workers’ compensation claims up to $0.5 million per
    occurrence, and automobile liability claims up to
    $1.0 million per occurrence. Third-party insurance provides
    primary level coverage in excess of these amounts up to certain
    specified limits. In addition, the Company has excess liability
    insurance from third-party insurers on both an aggregate and an
    individual occurrence basis well in excess of the limits of the
    primary coverage. A worldwide program of property insurance
    covers the Company’s owned and leased property and any
    business interruptions that may occur due to an insured hazard
    affecting those properties, subject to reasonable deductibles
    and aggregate limits.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Effective December 31, 2006, Dover adopted
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”). For
    additional information on Dover’s employee benefit plans,
    see “Recent Accounting Standards” below and
    Note 13.

Recent
    Accounting Standards

Effective December 31, 2006, Dover adopted
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”).
    SFAS No. 158 required companies to report the funded
    status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans on their balance sheets as a net liability or
    asset. Upon adoption at December 31, 2006, Dover recorded a
    net reduction to stockholders’ equity of
    $123.5 million, net of tax. In addition, effective for
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, the new
    standard will require companies to measure benefit obligations
    and plan assets as of a Company’s fiscal year end
    (December 31, 2008 for Dover), using one of the methods
    prescribed in the standard. Dover expects to adopt the new
    valuation date requirements using the

15-month

alternative, as prescribed in the standard, which will result in
    a charge of approximately $10.0 million to retained
    earnings in 2008.

Effective January 1, 2007, Dover adopted FIN 48. See
    Note 2 for additional information on the adoption of this
    standard.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”
    (“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
    accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. For financial assets and
    liabilities, this statement is effective for fiscal periods
    beginning after November 15, 2007 and does not require any
    new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB Staff
    Position

No. 157-2

was issued which delayed the effective date of FASB Statement
    No. 157 to fiscal years ending after November 15, 2008
    for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that
    are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The Company
    does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a
    material effect on its consolidated financial statements.



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” This statement permits entities to choose to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value. This statement is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
    including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company
    did not elect the fair value option for any of its existing
    financial instruments as of January 1, 2008 and the Company
    has not determined whether or not it will elect this option for
    financial instruments it may acquire in the future.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 requires that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity
    and the amount of consolidated net income specifically
    attributable to the noncontrolling interest be identified in the
    consolidated financial statements. It also requires consistency
    in the manner of reporting changes in the parent’s
    ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any
    noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation.
    The Company will apply the provisions of this statement
    prospectively, as required, beginning on January 1, 2009
    and does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a
    material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007), “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) retains the
    fundamental requirements in Statement 141 that the acquisition
    method of accounting (which Statement 141 called the purchase
    method) be used for all business combinations and for an
    acquirer to be identified for each business combination. In
    general, the statement 1) broadens the guidance of
    SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all events where
    one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses,
    2) broadens the use of fair value measurements used to
    recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
    3) changes the accounting for acquisition related fees and
    restructuring costs incurred in connection with an acquisition
    and 4) increases required disclosures. The Company will
    apply the provisions of this statement prospectively to business
    combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after
    January 1, 2009 and is currently assessing the impact of
    adoption of SFAS 141(R) on its consolidated financial
    statements.

2.  New
    Accounting Pronouncements

FIN 48

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48
    which specifies the way companies are to account for uncertainty
    in income tax reporting, and prescribes a methodology for
    recognizing, reversing and measuring the tax benefits of a tax
    position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. As a
    result of adopting the new standard, the Company recorded a
    $58.2 million increase to reserves as a “cumulative
    effect” decrease to opening retained earnings as of
    January 1, 2007, of which $53.4 million is included in
    continuing operations. Including this “cumulative
    effect” adjustment, the Company had unrecognized tax
    benefits, net of indirect benefits and deposits, of
    $190.5 million at January 1, 2007, of which

Acquisitions

All of the Company’s acquisitions have been accounted for
    under SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.”
    Accordingly, the accounts of the acquired companies, after
    adjustments to reflect fair market values assigned to assets and
    liabilities, have been included in the consolidated financial
    statements from their respective dates of acquisition.

The 2007 acquisitions (see list below) are wholly-owned and had
    an aggregate cost of $273.6 million, net of cash acquired,
    at the date of acquisition. There is no material contingent
    consideration related to the acquisitions at December 31,
    2007. In connection with certain acquisitions, at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had reserves
    related to severance and facility closings of $26.8 million
    and $17.9 million, respectively. During 2007, the Company
    recorded purchase accounting reserves related to acquisitions of
    $12.8 million and paid $3.9 million. The reserves were
    recorded as of the date of acquisition and in accordance with
    the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue

No. 95-3,

9.  Lines
    of Credit and Debt

On November 9, 2007, the Company entered into a
    $1 billion

5-year

unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks
    (the “Credit Agreement”) that replaced a facility with
    substantially similar terms. At the Company’s election,
    loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a
    Eurodollar or Sterling rate based on LIBOR, plus an applicable
    margin ranging from 0.130% to 0.35% (subject to adjustment based
    on the rating accorded the Company’s senior unsecured debt
    by S&P and Moody’s), or at a base rate pursuant to a
    formula defined in the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit
    Agreement requires the Company to pay a facility fee and a
    utilization fee in certain circumstances and imposes various
    restrictions on the Company such as, among other things, the
    requirement for the Company to maintain an interest coverage
    ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less
    than 3.5 to 1. The Company primarily uses this facility as
    liquidity

back-up

for
    its commercial paper program and has not drawn down any loans
    under the $1 billion facility and does not anticipate doing
    so. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had commercial
    paper outstanding in the principal amount of $600.7 million.

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company closed a
    structured five-year, non-interest bearing, $165.1 million
    amortizing loan with a non-US lender, which also included a
    participation fee received by the Company of $9.9 million.
    The loan was recorded at face value. The Company also expects to
    incur a total of $5.7 million in debt related issuance
    costs over the course of the loan. Beginning in April 2007, the
    repayment schedule requires payments every April and September
    with the final payment to be made in July 2011. The
    participation fee will be amortized ratably into Other Expense
    (income), net over the term of the loan and is recorded in Other
    Deferrals in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The loan agreement
    includes a put and call provision that can be exercised starting
    in June 2008 though the end of the loan term.

The Company renewed its Canadian Dollar Credit Facility in
    November 2007, which will expire on November 18, 2008, with
    the Bank of Nova Scotia. The new agreement replaced the previous
    $30 million Canadian (CAD) agreement and provides
    $15 million (CAD) bank credit availability in either
    Canadian Dollars or U.S. Dollars (USD), at the
    Company’s option. The outstanding borrowings at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 under the current and previous
    facilities were approximately $3 million (CAD) and
    $21 million (CAD), respectively. The covenants and interest
    rates under this facility match those of the $1 billion
    Credit Agreement.

On October 13, 2005, Dover issued $300 million of
    4.875% Notes due 2015 and $300 million of
    5.375% debentures due 2035. The net proceeds of
    $588.6 million from the notes and debentures were used to
    repay borrowings under Dover’s commercial paper program.
    The notes and debentures are redeemable at the option of Dover
    in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price that
    includes a make-whole premium, with accrued interest to the
    redemption date. In November 2005, the Company retired its
    6.45% Notes due November 15, 2005 with a face amount
    of $250.0 million.

On November 25, 2005, the Company established a
    €75 million credit facility with Credit Lyonnais. The
    interest rate on outstanding balances is 15 basis points
    over the Euribor rate and the annual commitment fee is
    5 basis points on unborrowed amounts. The facility has no
    material covenants. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
    there was no outstanding balance under this facility.

    than 1 year.

Includes unamortized discount of $5.2 million and

Annual repayments of long-term debt are $183.2 million in

    $434.2 million in 2011, $0.1 million in 2012 and
    $793.7 million thereafter.

The Company may, from time to time, enter into interest rate
    swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes.
    Interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange fixed and
    variable rate payments based on notional principal amounts.

During the third quarter of 2005, Dover entered into several
    treasury rate locks related to the notes and debentures that
    were issued on October 13, 2005. The contracts were settled
    on October 13, 2005 and the resulting gain of
    $3.0 million is being deferred in Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Earnings (Loss) and amortized over the life of the
    related notes and debentures.

As of December 31, 2007, there were two interest rate swap
    agreements outstanding for a total notional amount of
    $100.0 million, designated as fair value hedges on part of
    the Company’s $400.0 million 6.50% Notes due
    February 15, 2011. One $50 million interest rate swap
    exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest. The
    other $50 million swap is designated in foreign currency
    and exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest,
    and also hedges a portion of the Company’s net investment
    in

non-U.S. operations.

The swap agreements have reduced the effective interest rate on
    the notes to 6.43%. There is no hedge ineffectiveness. The fair
    value of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of
    December 31, 2007 was determined through market quotation.

10.  Equity
    and Cash Incentive Program

    Equity and Cash Incentive Plan

On April 20, 2004, the stockholders approved the Dover
    Corporation 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2005
    Plan”) to replace the 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan and
    1995 Cash Performance Program (the “1995 Plan”), which
    expired on January 30, 2005. Under the 2005 Plan, a maximum
    aggregate of 20 million shares are reserved for grants
    (non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation
    rights (“SARs”), and restricted stock) to key
    personnel between February 1, 2005 and January 31,
    2015, provided that no incentive stock options shall be granted
    under the plan after February 11, 2014 and a maximum of one
    million shares may be granted as restricted stock. The exercise
    price of options and SARs may not be less than the fair market
    value of the stock at the time the awards are granted. The
    period during which these options and SARs are exercisable is
    fixed by the Company’s Compensation Committee at the time
    of grant, but generally may not commence sooner than three years
    after the date of grant, and may not exceed ten years from the
    date of grant. All stock options or SARs issued under the 1995
    Plan or the 2005 Plan vest after three years of service and
    expire at the end of ten years. All stock options and SARs are
    granted at regularly scheduled quarterly Compensation Committee
    meetings (usually only at the meeting during the first quarter)
    and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
    Dover stock on that day. New common shares are issued when
    options or SARs are exercised.

In 2007, the Company issued 1,731,882 SARs under the 2005 Plan.
    No stock options were issued in 2007 and the Company does not
    anticipate issuing stock options in the future. The fair value
    of each grant was estimated on the date of grant using a
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following

The Company also has a restricted stock program (as part of the
    2005 Plan), under which common stock of the Company may be
    granted at no cost to certain officers and key employees. In
    general, restrictions limit the sale or transfer of these shares
    during a two or three year period, and restrictions lapse
    proportionately over the two or three year period. The Company
    did not grant any restricted shares in 2007 or 2006. Restricted
    shares granted in 2005 were 6,000.

In addition, the Company has a stock compensation plan under
    which non-employee directors are granted shares of Dover’s
    common stock each year as more than half of their compensation
    for serving as directors. During 2007, the Company issued an
    aggregate of 14,129 shares, net, of its common stock to
    twelve outside directors (after withholding 6,056 additional
    shares to satisfy tax obligations) as partial compensation for
    serving as directors of the Company during 2007. During 2006,
    the Company issued an aggregate of 11,004 shares of its
    common stock, net, to ten outside directors (after withholding
    an aggregate of 3,958 additional shares to satisfy tax
    obligations), as partial compensation for serving as directors
    of the Company during 2006. During 2005, the Company issued an
    aggregate of 12,860 shares, net, of its common stock to
    eight outside directors (after withholding an aggregate of 3,790
    additional shares to satisfy tax obligations), as partial
    compensation for serving as directors of the Company during 2005.

During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, the Board of
    Directors approved two separate share repurchase programs
    authorizing repurchases of approximately 20,000,000 common
    shares through the end of 2008. The Company entered into an
    accelerated share repurchase agreement on August 2, 2007
    (“ASR”) under which it purchased 6,000,000 shares
    of its common stock at an initial purchase price of $51.64 per
    share. Upon final settlement of this ASR in the fourth quarter
    of 2007, the final economic purchase price was $48.36 per share,
    representing an average of the volume weighted average price of
    the Company’s common stock during the outstanding period
    less a negotiated discount amount. In addition, during 2007, the
    Company made other open market purchases of its common stock
    totaling 6.4 million shares at an average price of $46.78
    per share.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company has research and development credits of
    $4.1 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $3.7 million at December 31, 2006 that are available
    for use by the Company between 2008 and 2026.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had available alternative
    minimum tax credits of $3.1 million, which are available
    for use by the Company indefinitely, and alternative minimum tax
    foreign tax credits of $11.7 million that are available for
    use by the Company between 2008 and 2026.

The Company maintains valuation allowances by jurisdiction
    against the deferred tax assets related to certain of these
    carryforwards as utilization of these tax benefits are not
    assured for certain jurisdictions.

The Company has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes
    or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings of its
    international subsidiaries because such earnings are reinvested
    and it is currently intended that they will continue to be
    reinvested indefinitely. At December 31, 2007, the Company
    has not provided for federal income taxes on earnings of
    approximately $670.8 million from its international
    subsidiaries.

In 2007, the Company recognized $19.8 million in tax
    benefits related to the resolution of various state and
    U.S. income tax issues. During 2006, the Company recognized
    an $11.0 million tax benefit, primarily related to the
    resolution of a state income tax issue. During 2005, the Company
    recognized a $25.5 million tax benefit, primarily related
    to the resolution of U.S. tax issues, including
    $5.5 million related to a favorable tax court decision.

On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”). The Act creates a
    temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
    accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends
    received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign
    corporations. During the second half of 2005, the Company
    recorded a net U.S. tax provision of $9.5 million
    related to the repatriation of $373.7 million of foreign
    dividends under the provisions of the Act.

Unrecognized
    Tax Benefits

Effective January 1, 2007, Dover adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48. See Note 2 for additional information on the
    impact of adoption on Dover’s Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Dover files Federal income tax returns, as well as multiple
    state, local and

non-U.S. jurisdiction

tax returns. The Company is no longer subject to examinations of
    its federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”) for years through 2004. All significant state
    and local, and international matters have been concluded for
    years through 1994 and 1999, respectively. With the exception of
    matters in litigation, for which an estimate cannot be made due
    to uncertainties, the Company does not believe it is reasonably
    possible that its unrecognized tax benefits will significantly
    change within the next twelve months.

Included in this balance are net potential tax benefits of
    $144.4 million that, if recognized, would impact the
    Company’s effective tax rate. During the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded
    potential interest and penalty expense/(income) of
    $12.9 million, $5.0 million and ($2.1) million,
    respectively, related to its unrecognized tax benefits as a
    component of provision for income taxes. The Company had accrued
    interest and penalties of $56.8 million at
    December 31, 2007 and $28.3 million at
    December 31, 2006, prior to the cumulative effect of
    adoption of FIN 48. The Company’s unrecognized tax
    benefits at December 31, 2007 are presented in Other
    Deferrals in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in Federal and
    Other Taxes on Income at December 31, 2006.

12.  Commitments
    and Contingent Liabilities

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal
    proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites
    identified under Federal and State statutes that provide for the
    allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible
    parties.” In each instance, the extent of the
    Company’s liability appears to be very small in relation to
    the total projected expenditures and the number of other
    “potentially responsible parties” involved and is
    anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few
    of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing
    remedial activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with
    regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been
    established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to
    a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their
    businesses. These proceedings primarily involve claims by
    private parties alleging injury arising out of use of the
    Company’s products, exposure to hazardous substances or
    patent infringement, litigation and administrative proceedings
    involving employment matters, and commercial disputes.
    Management and legal counsel periodically review the probable
    outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably
    expected to be incurred, the availability and extent of
    insurance coverage, and established reserves. While it is not
    possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal
    actions or any need for additional reserves, in the opinion of
    management, based on these reviews, it is very unlikely that the
    disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned
    above will have a material adverse effect on the financial
    position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive
    position of the Company.

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
    operating leases, many of which contain renewal options. Total
    rental expense, net of insignificant sublease rental income, on
    all operating leases was $70.9 million, $54.1 million
    and $52.6 million for the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Contingent rentals under the
    operating leases were not significant. Aggregate future minimum
    lease payments for operating leases as of December 31, 2007
    are $45.5 million in 2008, $34.5 million in 2009,
    $26.6 million in 2010, $19.1 million in 2011 and
    $59.9 million thereafter.

Aggregate future minimum lease payments for capital leases as of
    December 31, 2007 are $2.3 million in 2008,
    $1.7 million in 2009, $1.5 million in 2010,
    $1.4 million in 2011 and $9.0 million thereafter.

13.  Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer a defined
    contribution plan to their employees. The Company also has
    defined benefit pension plans (the “plans”) covering
    certain employees of Dover and its subsidiaries. The plans’
    benefits are generally based on years of service and employee
    compensation. The Company’s funding policy is consistent
    with the funding requirements of ERISA and applicable
    international laws. Dover uses a measurement date of
    September 30th for the majority of its pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans. However, beginning in fiscal
    year 2008, as required under SFAS No. 158, Dover will
    use December 31, 2008 as its valuation date. See
    Note 1 “Recent Accounting Standards” for a
    discussion of the new required valuation date and the expected
    impact of adoption on Dover.

The Company is responsible for overseeing the management of the
    investments of the plans’ assets and otherwise ensuring
    that the plans’ investment programs are in compliance with
    ERISA, other relevant legislation, and related plan documents.
    Where relevant, the Company has retained professional investment
    managers to manage the plans’ assets and implement the
    investment process. The investment managers, in implementing
    their investment processes, have the authority and
    responsibility to select appropriate investments in the asset
    classes specified by the terms of their applicable prospectus or
    investment manager agreements with the plans.

The primary financial objective of the plans is to secure
    participant retirement benefits. Accordingly, the key objective
    in the plans’ financial management is to promote stability
    and, to the extent appropriate, growth in funded status. Related
    and supporting financial objectives are established in
    conjunction with a review of current and projected plan
    financial requirements.

The assets of the plans are invested to achieve an appropriate
    return for the plans consistent with a prudent level of risk.
    The asset return objective is to achieve, as a minimum over
    time, the passively managed return earned by market index funds,
    weighted in the proportions outlined by the asset class
    exposures identified in the plans’ strategic allocation.

The expected return on asset assumption used for pension expense
    was developed through analysis of historical market returns,
    current market conditions and the past experience of plan asset
    investments. In developing the expected return on asset
    assumption, estimates of future market returns by asset category
    are less than actual long-term historical returns in order to
    best anticipate future experience. Overall, it is projected that
    the investment of plan assets will achieve an 8.0% net return
    over time from the asset allocation strategy.

Dover’s discount rate assumption is determined by
    constructing a portfolio of highly rated bonds to match the
    expected benefit stream to be paid from the plans. The benefit
    payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons and
    maturities, as well as interest on the excess cash flows from
    the bond portfolio.

The Company also provides, through non-qualified plans,
    supplemental retirement benefits in excess of qualified plan
    limits imposed by Federal tax law. These plans are supported by
    the general assets of the Company.

Pension cost for all defined contribution, defined benefit, and
    supplemental plans was $80.5 million for 2007,
    $70.5 million for 2006 and $48.0 million for 2005.

For post-retirement benefit measurement purposes, a 10% annual
    rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits
    (i.e., health care cost trend rates) was assumed for 2008. The
    rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5% by the year 2017
    and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend
    rate assumption can have an effect on the amounts reported. For
    example, increasing (decreasing) the assumed health care cost
    trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase
    (decrease) the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as
    of December 31, 2007 by $0.5 million
    ($0.4 million) and would have a negligible impact on the
    net post-retirement benefit cost for 2007.

The post-retirement benefit plans cover approximately 1,800
    participants, approximately 1,200 of whom are eligible for
    medical benefits. The plans are effectively closed to new
    entrants. The post-retirement benefit obligation amounts at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 include approximately
    $4.4 million and $4.3 million in obligations,
    respectively, recorded in discontinued operations.

14.  Segment
    Data

Effective July 1, 2007, the Company realigned its segment
    structure from six to four segments. All years presented have
    been conformed to the current year presentation.

Dover identifies its operating segments through the underlying
    management reporting structure related to its operating
    companies and through commonalities related to products,
    processes, distribution

and/or

markets served. The Company’s segment structure allows the
    management of each segment to focus its attention on particular
    markets and provide oversight capacity to acquire additional
    businesses.

Dover’s four reportable segments are briefly described
    below:

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue is attributed to regions based on the location of the
    Company’s customer, which in some instances is an
    intermediary and not necessarily the end user. Long-lived assets
    are comprised of net property, plant and equipment. The
    Company’s operating companies are based primarily in the
    United States of America and Europe. Dover’s businesses
    serve thousands of customers, none of which accounted for more
    than 10% of consolidated revenue. Accordingly, it is
    impracticable to provide revenue from external customers for
    each product and service sold by segment. Selected financial
    information by market segment is as follows:

Changes

    Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31,
    2007 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
    Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
    Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and
    communicated to the Company’s management, including its
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

During the fourth quarter of 2007, there were no changes in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations Over Internal Controls

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that:

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that the Company’s receipts and
    expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of the Company’s management and
    directors; and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Management’s report on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the
    Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all
    errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
    are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
    the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
    of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
    of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance
    that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have
    been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those
    internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9B.

Not applicable.

The Company has three compensation plans under which equity
    securities of the Company have been authorized for issuance and
    have been issued to employees and to non-employee directors.
    These are the 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan and 1995 Cash
    Performance Program (the “1995 Plan”), the 2005 Equity
    and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”) and the 1996
    Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Compensation Plan (the
    “Directors’



Plan”). The information regarding the 2005 Plan and the
    Directors’ Plan that is required to be included pursuant to
    this Item 12 is included under the captions “Equity
    Plans” (following the table entitled “Outstanding
    Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End”) and
    “Directors’ Compensation,” respectively, in the
    2008 Proxy Statement and is incorporated in this Item 12 by
    reference. The table above does not reflect shares eligible for
    issuance under the 1996 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock
    Compensation Plan, which does not specify a maximum number of
    shares issuable under it.

The 1995 Plan was adopted in 1995 (replacing the 1984 Plan which
    expired in January 1995) and provided for stock options,
    restricted stock awards and cash performance awards. The 1995
    Plan expired in January 2005, but Column A of the table above
    includes options that remain outstanding under it.

The 1995 Plan was intended to promote the medium-term and
    long-term success of Dover by providing salaried officers and
    other key employees of Dover and its subsidiaries with
    medium-range and long-range inducements to remain with Dover and
    to encourage them to increase their efforts to make Dover
    successful. Options granted under the 1995 Plan were all
    designated as non-qualified stock options.

The exercise price of options is the fair market value on the
    date of grant as determined in good faith by the Compensation
    Committee. Options granted under this plan may not be sold,
    transferred, hypothecated, pledged or otherwise disposed of by
    any of the holders except by will or by the laws of descent and
    distribution except that a holder may transfer any non-qualified
    option granted under this plan to members of the holder’s
    immediate family, or to one or more trusts for the benefit of
    such family members, provided that the holder does not receive
    any consideration for the transfer.

The information above summarizes the material aspects of the
    1995 Plan. The rights and obligations of participants are
    determined by the provisions of the plan document itself.

Item 13.

Certain
    Relationships and Related Transactions and Director
    Independence

    business relationship or indebtedness between the Company and
    the beneficial owners of more than 5% of the Common Stock, the
    directors or nominees for director of the Company, the executive
    officers of the Company or the members of the immediate families
    of such individuals that are required to be included pursuant to
    this Item 13 is included in Dover’s 2008 Proxy
    Statement under the caption “ITEMS TO BE VOTED UPON,
    Proposal 1 — Election of Directors” and is
