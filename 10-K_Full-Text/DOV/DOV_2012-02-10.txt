PART 1

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Overview

Dover Corporation is a diversified, multinational corporation that manufactures a broad range of specialized products and components and also offers related services and consumables.  Dover provides its customers with outstanding products and services that reflect the company’s commitment to operational excellence, innovation and market leadership

.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, references herein to “Dover,” “the Company,” and such words as “we,” “us,” and “our” include Dover Corporation and its subsidiaries.  Dover was incorporated in 1947 in the State of Delaware and became a publicly traded company in 1955.  Dover is headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois and currently employs approximately 34,000 people worldwide.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, we reorganized into four new business segments that are aligned with the key end-markets they serve:  Communication Technologies, Energy, Engineered Systems and Printing & Identification.  We believe the segment reorganization provides better alignment and focus around our end-markets, allows for better leverage of our executive leadership talent and expertise, helps improve the sharing and leveraging of resources within and between the four segments, enhances execution of business-specific strategies, and facilitates internal and external benchmarking against companies serving similar markets.

Our Communication Technologies segment is engaged in the design and manufacture of innovative products and components in the communications, life sciences, aerospace/industrial, defense, and telecommunication/other markets.  Our Energy segment provides highly-engineered solutions for the safe and efficient extraction and handling of oil and gas in the drilling, production and downstream markets.  Our Engineered Systems segment is comprised of two platforms, Fluid Solutions and Refrigeration & Industrial, which are industry leaders in the fluids systems, refrigeration and food equipment, and certain industrial markets.  Our Printing & Identification segment provides integrated printing, coding, and testing solutions for the consumer goods, food, pharmaceutical, industrial, electronics and alternative energy markets.

The following table shows the percentage of total annual revenue generated by each of our four segments over the last three years:

Management Philosophy

Our businesses are committed to operational excellence, and to being market leaders as measured by market share, customer service, innovation, profitability and return on invested capital.  Our operating structure of four business segments and two platforms allows for focused acquisition activity, accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies, including global sourcing and supply chain integration, and advances the development of our executive talent.  Our segment and executive management set strategic direction, initiatives and goals, provide oversight, allocate and manage capital, are responsible for major acquisitions, and provide other services.  We foster an operating culture with high ethical standards, trust, respect and open communication, to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness.

In addition, we are committed to creating value for our customers, employees and shareholders through sustainable business practices that protect the environment and developing products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals. Our companies are increasing their focus on efficient energy usage, greenhouse gas reduction and waste management as they strive to meet the global environmental needs of today and tomorrow.



Company Goals

We are committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives.  First, we are committed to achieving annual organic sales growth over the next three years (2012 through 2014) of 7% to 9%, complemented by acquisition growth of 3% to 5% over the same periods.  Secondly, we continue to focus on segment margin expansion through productivity initiatives, including supply chain activities, strategic pricing and portfolio shaping.  We are targeting segment margins of approximately 19% by 2014, representing an increase of roughly 200 basis points over our 2011 segment margins.  Lastly, we are committed to generating free cash flow as a percentage of sales in excess of 10% through disciplined capital allocation, strong performance, productivity improvements and active working capital management.  We support these goals through (1) alignment of management compensation with financial objectives, (2) well-defined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes, and (3) talent development programs.

Business Strategy

To achieve our goals, we are focused on execution of the following three key business strategies:

Positioning ourselves for growth

We have aligned our business segments to focus on key-end markets that are well-positioned for future growth.  In particular, our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on growth trends in the areas of global energy demand, sustainability, consumer product safety, communications and emerging economies.  For instance, our Communication Technologies segment is positioned to capitalize on growth in handheld communications (handsets), life sciences and aerospace, with its complement of micro audio components and communication components serving those markets.  Our Energy segment is driven by a growing demand for innovative extraction technologies. The growing emerging economies, plus expanding exploration activity around the globe will provide significant opportunities for this segment.  Our Engineered Systems segment combines its engineering technology, unique product advantages, and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including sustainability, consumer product safety and growth in emerging economies, while our Printing & Identification segment is responding to the growing requirements for consumer product safety and renewable energy technologies by providing integrated printing, coding and identification solutions with a global reach, in the growing markets of fast moving consumer goods, industrial, and electronics, including alternative energy.

Capturing the benefits of common ownership

We are committed to operational excellence, and have implemented various productivity initiatives, such as supply chain management, lean manufacturing, and facility consolidations to maximize our efficiency, coupled with workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees.  We foster the sharing of best practices throughout the organization.  To ensure success, our businesses place strong emphasis on continual quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets.  We have also developed regional support centers and shared manufacturing centers in China, Brazil and India. We also continue to make significant investments in talent development, recognizing that the growth and development of our employees are key to our continued success.

Disciplined capital allocation

Our businesses generate annual free cash flow of approximately 10% of revenue.  We are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize investment returns.  To do this, we grow and support our existing businesses, with annual investment in capital spending approximating 3% of revenue with a focus on internal projects to expand markets, develop products and boost productivity.  We continue to evaluate our portfolio for strategic fit and intend to make additional acquisitions focused on our key growth spaces: communication components, energy, product ID, refrigeration and food equipment, and fluid solutions.  We consistently provide shareholder returns by paying dividends, which have increased annually over each of the last 56 years.  We will also continue to repurchase our shares principally to cover market dilution.

Portfolio Development

Acquisitions

Our acquisition program has two key elements.  First, we seek to acquire value creating add-on businesses that enhance our existing businesses either through their global reach and customer mix, or by broadening their product mix.  Second, in the right circumstances, we will strategically pursue larger, stand-alone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces.  Over the past three years (2009 – 2011), we have spent over $1.7 billion to purchase 21 businesses that strategically fit within our business model.  This included the largest acquisition in our history, that of Sound Solutions in July of 2011 for approximately $800 million. By enhancing the product offerings serving the high growth handset market, the acquisition of Sound Solutions has enabled our Communication Technologies segment to be a global leader in audio components serving this market.  At the beginning of 2011, in order to build out our artificial lift portfolio within our Energy segment, we spent approximately $400 million to acquire Harbison-Fischer, a designer and manufacturer of down-hole rod pumps and related products used in artificial lift applications around the world.



For more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  Our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses, as a substantial number of our current businesses operate in relatively mature markets.  While we expect to generate annual organic growth of 4% - 5% over a business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions, sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year.  Our success is also dependent on the ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses within our existing structure. To track post-merger integration and accountability, we utilize an internal tool kit and defined processes to ensure synergies are realized and value is created.

Dispositions

We continually review our portfolio to evaluate whether our businesses continue to be essential contributors to our long-term growth strategy.  Occasionally, we may also make an opportunistic sale of one of our businesses based on specific market conditions and strategic considerations.  Accordingly, in an effort to focus on our higher margin growth spaces, during the past three years (2009 - 2011) we have sold four businesses for aggregate consideration of

approximately $


million

. The financial position and results of operations for these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations.  For more details, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Over the same period, disposals of a few minor non-core divisions of our businesses generated additional proceeds of approximately $8 million.

Business Segments

As noted previously, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we reorganized our businesses into four new business segments that are aligned with the key end-markets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments:  Communication Technologies, Energy, Engineered Systems and Printing & Identification.  For financial information about our segments and geographic areas, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  All information set forth within this Annual Report has been recast to reflect the new segmentation.

Printing & Identification

Our Printing & Identification segment is a worldwide supplier of precision marking & coding, dispensing, printing, soldering, coating, inspection and testing equipment and related consumables and services.  The segment serves three broad global end-markets: fast moving consumer goods, industrial, and electronics.

·

Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)

– Our businesses serving this market primarily design and manufacture marking & coding products used for printing variable information (such as date codes and serial numbers) on food, beverage, consumer goods, and pharmaceutical products, capitalizing on expanding food and product safety requirements and growth in emerging markets.

·

Industrial

– Our products used by the industrial market are primarily marking & coding, bar code & portable printers, and fluid dispensing related products serving a number of industrial end markets including aerospace, cable, military, material packaging, industrial assembly, and medical devices capitalizing on growing industrial-related manufacturing in emerging markets.  Additional products include broad line marking solutions leveraged for secondary packaging, such as cartons and pallets for use in warehouse logistics operations, and bar code printers and portable printers used where on demand labels/receipts are required.

·

Electronics –

Our businesses serving the electronics market primarily design and manufacture high-speed precision material deposition machines and other related tools used in the assembly process for printed circuit boards, solar cells and other specialty electronic applications as well as precision manual soldering, de-soldering and other hand tools.  The test equipment products include machines, test fixtures and related products used in testing “bare” and “loaded” electronic circuit boards and semiconductors.

Printing & Identification’s products are manufactured primarily in the United States, France, China, Malaysia, and Germany, and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors.

Raw Materials

We use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished components, which are generally available from a number of sources. As a result, shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had, and are not likely to have, a material impact on operating profits. While the required raw materials are generally available, commodity pricing has trended upward over the past few years, particularly for various grades of steel, copper, aluminum, select other commodities, and rare earth metals. Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. We attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global supply chain activities.

Research and Development

Our businesses are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs, expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally, maintain or extend competitive advantages, improve product reliability and reduce production costs.  During 2011, we spent $197.0 million for research and development, including qualified engineering costs. In 2010 and 2009, research and development spending totaled $186.7 million and $172.1 million, respectively.

Our Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments expend significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high. Our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment and specialty electronic components for the consumer goods, handset, life sciences, datacom and telecom commercial markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation, performance improvement and reduced costs. The result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period.

Our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives. These businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and market applications, and continuously improving manufacturing processes. Most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments.

Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets

Our businesses own many patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over a number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various times over a number of years.  A large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents, unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate. In addition, a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships. While our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success, the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships, or any group of related rights or relationships, is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis. We believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements, new product development and improved manufacturing techniques, as well as strong sales, marketing and service efforts, are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve.



Seasonality

In general, our businesses, while not strongly seasonal, tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, particularly those serving the consumer electronics, transportation, construction, waste and recycling, petroleum, commercial refrigeration and food service markets.  Our businesses serving the major equipment markets, such as power generation, chemical and processing industries, have long lead times geared to seasonal, commercial or consumer demands, and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends, which tends to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns.

Customers

We serve thousands of customers, no one of which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2011. Similarly, within each of our four segments, no customer accounted for more than 10% of any individual segment’s revenue in 2011.

Given our diversity of served markets, customer concentrations are quite varied.  Businesses supplying the waste and recycling, agricultural, defense, energy, automotive, commercial refrigeration, handset and hearing aid industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries. This also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation, aerospace and chemical industries. In the other markets served, there is usually a much lower concentration of customers, particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of end-use applications.

Certain of our businesses, particularly within the Communication Technologies segment, serve the military, space, aerospace, commercial and datacom/telecom infrastructure markets. Their customers include some of the largest operators in these markets. In addition, many of the OEM customers within the Communication Technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) companies.  Other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid manufacturers, many of the largest global EMS companies, particularly in China, and major printed circuit board and semiconductor manufacturers.

Backlog

Backlog is generally not a significant indicator of long-term performance, as most of our products have relatively short order-to-delivery periods. It is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have long-term government contracts, primarily in the aerospace and industrial markets of our Communication Technologies segment.  Our total backlog as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $1,446.5 million and $1,262.5 million, respectively.

Competition

Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served. In general, most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies, and the key competitive factors are customer service, product quality, price and innovation.  However, as we become increasingly global, we are exposed to  more competition. Certain businesses in the Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments compete globally against a variety of companies, primarily operating in Europe and East Asia.

International

Consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth, we continue to increase our expansion into international markets, particularly in developing economies in South America, Asia and Eastern Europe.

Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and, with increasing emphasis, China, Malaysia, India, Mexico, Brazil and Eastern Europe.

Our international operations are subject to certain risks, such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and non-U.S. governmental restrictions, which are discussed further in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

For additional details regarding our non-U.S. revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are governed by a variety of international, national, state and local environmental laws.  We are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws. In a few instances, particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances. Where necessary, these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance.

In 2010, we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.  In 2011, we evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities and developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes clearly defined goals and objectives, along with prioritized programs and projects for achieving energy use and greenhouse gas emissions reductions.  We have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20% from 2010 to 2020.  We also participated in the 2011 Carbon Disclosure Project as a respondent.

All of our segments are investigating the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the use of their products and services by customers.  In some instances, our businesses may be able to help customers reduce some of their energy needs. Increased demand for energy-efficient products, based on a variety of drivers (including, but not limited to, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses.

There have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment.  We are  aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehouse/distribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses.  We anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short- to medium-term.  We expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in “pass through” costs from energy suppliers, suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations.

Employees

We had approximately 34,000 employees in continuing operations as of December 31, 2011, which was an increase of 14% from the prior year end.  The increase reflects the impact of recent acquisitions as well as additional headcount necessary to support the volume growth in 2011.

Other Information

We make available through the “Financial Reports” link on our Internet website, http://www.dovercorporation.com, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports. We post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information on our Internet website is not incorporated into this Form 10-K.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters, and their effect on global energy markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. The risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed.



·

Our results for 2012 may be impacted by current domestic and international economic conditions and uncertainties.

In 2012, our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate. These circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations, particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce.  Such negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control, are highly unpredictable, and can have an adverse effect on our revenue, earnings, cash flows and cost of capital.

·

Increasing product/service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants and our ability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.

Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, and pricing pressures. If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services and/or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.

·

Some of our businesses may not anticipate, adapt to, or capitalize on technological developments and are subject to the cyclical nature of their industries. These factors could cause these businesses to become less competitive and lead to reduced market share, revenue, operating profits and cash flows.

Certain of our businesses sell their products in electronic and technology-based industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed. In order to grow and remain competitive in these industries, they must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands. Also, a portion of the Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments’ revenue is derived from markets that are subject to unpredictable short-term business cycles.

Our Energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of energy prices and regulations which impact production, although overall demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global economic conditions and related energy demands.

As a result of all the above factors, the revenue and operating performance of these businesses in any one period are not necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating performance in other periods, and these factors could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

·

We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials (including energy) or if we are unable to obtain raw materials.

We purchase raw materials, subassemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations, which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities. Significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses.  While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors. In addition, while raw materials are generally available now, the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact revenue, operating profits and cash flows.



·

We are subject to risks relating to our existing foreign operations and expansion into new geographical markets.

Approximately 49% of our revenues for 2011 and 48% of our revenues for 2010 were derived outside the United States. We continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from and into foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the United States.  Our foreign operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to international operations, including:

o

political, social and economic instability and disruptions;

o

government embargoes or trade restrictions;

o

the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;

o

import and export controls;

o

limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;

o

transportation delays and interruptions;

o

labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;

o

increased compliance costs including requirements for disclosure and due diligence;

o

the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;

o

difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; and

o

limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.

If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets or our results of operations and financial position.

·

Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.

We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lower-cost locations and sold in various countries. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Pound Sterling, Swiss franc, Chinese RMB (Yuan) and the Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations.  Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the Euro and U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries such as China. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.

·

Our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if we cannot achieve projected savings and synergies.

We are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations. If we are unable to reduce costs and expenses through our various programs, it could adversely affect our operating profits and cash flows.



·

Failure to attract, retain and develop personnel or to provide adequate succession plans for key management could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

Our growth, profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel, align them with appropriate opportunities and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions. If we are unsuccessful in these efforts, our operating results could be adversely affected.

·

Our businesses and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes (including environmental and employment regulations and tax policies such as export subsidy programs, research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations, and other similar programs), risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.

Our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws (including environmental and export laws), regulations and policies. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws, including environmental protection, employment, and health and safety laws, will not exceed our estimates. In addition, we have invested in certain countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation.

Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments.

·

Customer requirements and new regulations may increase our expenses and impact the availability of certain raw materials, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating profits.

Our businesses use parts or materials that are impacted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) requirement for disclosure of the use of “conflict minerals” mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries.  Some of our businesses' customers already have announced that they will require “conflict free” metals in products they purchase.

We have begun the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals used by our businesses, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The supply chain due diligence and verification of sources may require several years to complete based on the current availability of smelter origin information and the number of vendors.  We have begun to obtain and review the information from our suppliers. We may not be able to complete the process in the timeframe required because of the complexity of our supply chain.

Other governmental social responsibility

regulations

also may impact our suppliers, manufacturing operations and operating profits.

The need to find alternative sources for certain raw materials or products because of customer requirements and regulations may impact our ability to secure adequate supplies of raw materials or parts, lead to supply shortages, or adversely impact the prices at which our businesses can procure

compliant goods

.

·

Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation could adversely affect our financial condition.

We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products, exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may

have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.



·

The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.

Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot be assured that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position.

·

Our revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.

Our businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products. Our businesses employ various measures to maintain and protect their intellectual property. These measures may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and have a negative impact on our revenue, operating profits and cash flows.

·

Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.

We expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts, then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected.  In addition a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations, may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated, or may expose us to unexpected liabilities. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies.  These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our operating profits and cash flows.

·

Our borrowing costs may be impacted by our credit ratings developed by various rating agencies.

Three major ratings agencies (Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings) evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our long-term debt as of December 31, 2011.  Although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings, if our current credit ratings deteriorate, then our borrowing costs could increase, including increased fees under our Five-Year Credit Facility, and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected.

·

Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.

We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy.  Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits and could damage our reputation

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

The number, type, location and size of our properties as of December 31, 2011 are shown in the following charts, by segment:

During 2011, we increased the number of our manufacturing and warehouse facilities, generally reflecting the facilities of the nine businesses acquired during the year. We believe our facilities are well-maintained and suitable for our operations.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

A few of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible parties.” In each instance, the extent of the subsidiary’s liability appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other “potentially responsible parties” involved and it is anticipated to be immaterial to us on a consolidated basis. In addition, a few of our subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been established.

We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to our businesses. These proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of the use of our businesses' products, exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. Management and legal counsel periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred, the availability and extent of insurance coverage, and established reserves. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions or any need for additional reserves, in the opinion of management, based on these reviews, it is unlikely that the disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive position.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of  Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended December 31, 2011. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes which appear elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and in “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” inside the front cover of this Form 10-K.

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

Dover delivered a record year in 2011 in terms of revenue, earnings, and bookings. Our consolidated revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 20%, to $8.0 billion, inclusive of acquisitions, while our bookings grew by $1.2 billion, or 17%, to $8.1 billion, and our gross profit grew by $435 million, or 17%, to $3.1 billion. However, our gross profit margin as a percentage of sales decreased 100 basis points to 38.4% mainly due to product and customer mix as well as the impact of recent acquisitions, which more than offset operating leverage.  Earnings from continuing operations increased 23% to $846 million.

In addition to our strong financial results, we accomplished several important strategic initiatives in 2011. We realigned our businesses into four new segments to more closely match our key end-markets. This new structure will serve to support our growth strategies and productivity initiatives as we continue to build our company.  During 2011, we deployed $1.4 billion on nine acquisitions that added technology, opened new markets, and expanded geography in nearly all of our growth spaces.  We also divested three businesses consistent with our strategy of focusing on our higher margin growth spaces.  We received proceeds in excess of $500 million which we intend to utilize on future acquisitions or internal investments. Lastly, we generated $786 million in free cash flow, which enabled us to aggressively invest in higher growth economies and innovation, and to continue our long tradition of raising our annual dividend, now standing at 56 consecutive years.

As we concluded the fourth quarter, we encountered certain challenges, such as continued weakness in alternative energy, semi-conductor and telecom infrastructure markets and general softness within the European economy, including uncertainty around European credit markets, that may continue to impact our operations going into 2012.

Despite these challenges, given our strong financial position and the depth and resilience of our business mix, we believe that through continued execution of our strategies around positioning ourselves to capitalize on global growth trends, capturing the benefits of common ownership and disciplined capital allocation, we are well positioned for solid growth in 2012.

We expect 2012 full year organic growth to be in the range of 4% to 7% and acquisition related growth to be approximately 3% for acquisitions completed in 2011. Based on these revenue assumptions and profitability expectations, we expect our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2012 will be in the range of $4.70 to $5.00 and expect our earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of being higher in the second and third quarters.



CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

As discussed in

Note 3

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are reporting three businesses that were sold during the third and fourth quarters of 2011 as discontinued operations. Therefore, we have classified the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Revenue

Our 2011 consolidated revenue increased $1.3 billion or 20% compared with 2010, reflecting organic growth of 11%, growth from acquisitions of 7% and a favorable impact from currency translation of 2%.  The majority of our organic growth was attributed to increased volumes across all four segments driven by strength in the energy and consumer handset markets and solid growth in fluid solutions, refrigeration equipment and many of the industrial markets served by our Engineered Systems segment.  Additionally, approximately 2% of our growth was generated by new products, particularly in our Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments.  Pricing added about 1% to revenue principally driven by strategic pricing initiatives and price increases implemented to offset higher commodity costs.  Revenues generated outside of the U.S. increased by 22% compared with 2010, with revenue generated in emerging economies of China and Latin America increasing 47%.

Over 70% of the revenue growth from acquisitions was generated by Harbison-Fischer and Sound Solutions, two large acquisitions that we made in 2011 to expand our operations serving the artificial lift and handset markets, respectively.

Our 2010 consolidated revenue increased $1.3 billion or 24% compared with 2009, reflecting organic revenue growth of 20%, growth from acquisitions of 4%, and a negligible unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.  The organic growth reflected volume increases across all four of our segments, driven by higher demand in the majority of our end-markets as the global economy continued to rebound in 2010 from the 2009 down cycle.  Revenues generated outside of the U.S. increased by 30% compared with 2009, with much of this growth generated in emerging economies of Asia and Latin America.

Gross Profit

Our gross profit increased $434.8 million or 17% in 2011 compared with 2010, reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes.  However, gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue contracted 100 basis points in 2011 to 38.4% from 39.4% in 2010 due principally to the impact of product and customer mix, which more than offset operating leverage,

as well as the impact of higher depreciation from recent acquisitions.

Gross profit increased $603.5 million or 30% in 2010 compared with 2009, reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes.  Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue was 39.4% in 2010, a 170 basis point improvement over the 2009 gross profit margin of 37.7%, reflecting the increase in sales volumes in 2010, the impact of lower restructuring charges on a comparative basis, and benefits realized from restructuring initiatives executed in 2009 along with our productivity initiatives.



Selling and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses increased $233.3 million or 15% in 2011 compared with 2010 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes. As a percentage of revenue, selling and administrative expenses declined to 23.2% in 2011 compared with 24.2% in 2010. This 100 basis point improvement is largely a result of leverage from the higher revenue levels, which more than offset higher amortization and other nonrecurring expenses related to recent acquisitions.

Selling and administrative expenses increased $185.3 million or 13% in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes. As a percentage of revenue, selling and administrative expenses declined to 24.2% in 2010 compared with 26.6% in 2009. This 240 basis point improvement reflects the absence of significant restructuring charges in 2010 and the benefits realized from 2009 restructuring efforts, as well as leverage from the higher revenue levels partially offset by increased compensation costs.

Non-Operating Items

Interest expense, net, increased 9% to $115.6 million in 2011 due primarily to higher average outstanding borrowings during 2011 as compared with 2010. As discussed in

Note


to

the

Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, in February of 2011

we issued $800 million in new notes, receiving net proceeds of $789 million, approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire $400 million of notes which came due earlier that month, with the remainder used to fund first quarter acquisitions.  As a result, our total borrowings were $380 million higher at the end of 2011 compared to the end of 2010.

In 2010, interest expense, net, increased 6.0% to $106.4 million, primarily due to reduced interest income in 2010 resulting from lower interest rates on the Company’s short term investment balances.

Other non-operating expense (income), net of $0.1 million in 2011 includes $8.6 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, offset by royalty income and other miscellaneous non-operating gains, none of which are individually significant.  Other non-operating expense, net of $3.7 million in 2010 reflects $6.9 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, coupled with a $4.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt, offset in part by royalty income and other miscellaneous non-operating gains. This compares to other non-operating income, net of $3.8 million in 2009, which reflects $6.1 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, which was more than offset by a favorable insurance settlement and other miscellaneous non-operating gains.

Income Taxes

The 2011 effective tax rate on continuing operations was 22.7% compared to the 2010 rate of 23.2%.  The effective tax rate was impacted by net favorable discrete and other items in both years (primarily driven by favorable audit settlements for uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions relating to prior periods).  The effective rate for 2011 was favorably impacted by net discrete items totaling $41.3 million, principally arising from settlements with the U.S. federal taxing authority and state taxing authorities. The effective tax rate for 2010 was favorably impacted by net discrete and other items totaling $50.3 million, arising principally from settlements with the U.S. federal taxing authority, coupled with the resolution of a foreign tax matter. The effective tax rate of 24.5% in 2009 was favorably impacted by $31.6 million of net benefits recognized for discrete items.

Excluding these discrete and other items (a non-GAAP measure), the effective tax rate was 26.5% in 2011, 28.8% in 2010, and 30.9% in 2009, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, with the earnings generated in foreign markets typically taxed at lower rates than in the U.S.

While we believe additional uncertain tax positions will be settled within the next twelve months, an estimate cannot be made due to the uncertainties associated with the resolution of these matters.



Net Earnings

Net earnings from continuing operations was $846.4 million in 2011, an increase of 23% compared to 2010 due mainly to the earnings on increased revenue and a lower effective tax rate.  Net earnings from continuing operations were $690.8 million in 2010, an increase of 85% compared to 2009, mainly due to increased revenues, operating margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate.

Net earnings from discontinued operations increased to $48.9 million in 2011, primarily reflecting income of $53.6 million from the operations of the three businesses sold this year and adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities, offset in part by a net loss on the sale of these businesses of $4.7 million, inclusive of goodwill impairment. In 2010, our net earnings from discontinued operations of $9.4 million includes income of $23.6 million from the operations of the businesses sold in 2011 and adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities, offset in part by a net loss of approximately $14.2 million related to the sale of a business that had been reflected as a discontinued operation in a previous year.  The 2009 net loss from discontinued operations of $17.0 million includes a net loss on sale of $11.2 million, mainly related to a write-down of a business held for sale, coupled with other net losses from operations totaling $5.8 million.  Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on disposed and discontinued operations.

Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 increased 23% to $4.48 and diluted net earnings per share increased 28% to $4.74, as a result of the same factors discussed above.

Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in 2010 increased 83% to $3.65 and diluted net earnings per share increased 94% to $3.70, as a result of the same factors discussed above.

Restructuring Activity

We periodically undertake restructuring programs in response to prevailing business requirements and market conditions. In addition to these factors, 2009 earnings across all segments were also negatively impacted by restructuring charges, while 2011 and 2010 earnings reflect the benefits captured from the businesses’ restructuring and integration programs initiated in 2008 and 2009.

In late 2008, we launched various synergy capture programs and restructuring initiatives in response to the weakening global economic environment at the time.  In 2008 and 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $23.9 million and $67.3 million, respectively, relating to these programs. These programs were largely executed throughout 2009, and we realized incremental savings of approximately $125 million and $32 million in 2009 and 2010, respectively. During 2009, we had a net reduction in our workforce of approximately 2,950, or 9%, and a net reduction of 23 manufacturing and warehouse facilities, as a result of these strategic restructuring efforts.  By 2010, we had completed the majority of the initiatives launched in 2008 and 2009.

In 2010 and 2011, our businesses were generally expanding their operations, so our restructuring activities were limited to a few targeted facility consolidations. We incurred restructuring charges of $6.2 million and $5.7 million, respectively, relating to such activities.

We do not currently anticipate significant restructuring activity in 2012, but will continue to monitor business activity across our end markets and adjust capacity as necessary depending on the economic climate and other internal business factors.



SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

As discussed previously, in the fourth quarter of 2011 we reorganized our businesses into four new segments to better align with our key end-markets.  As such, the information herein has been recast to conform to the new segment structure for all periods presented.

See

Note 1


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment revenue, earnings and operating margin to our consolidated revenue, earnings from continuing operations, and operating margin.

2011 Versus 2010

Revenue generated by our Communication Technologies segment increased $284.1 million, or 26%, compared with 2010, with $190.2 million, or 18% of the growth, attributed principally to the 2011 acquisition of Sound Solutions, which supplements our product offerings in the growing handset market.  Although there was an incremental decrease in revenue due to normal pricing concessions for our communication and telecommunication products corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities, this decrease was more than offset by revenue growth from market share gains, new product introductions and product mix.

Our organic revenue growth of 7% was largely due to continued strong demand for smart phones serving the communications market which grew significantly year over year.  Our revenue in the communications market (representing 31% of 2011 segment revenue) increased $66.6 million, or 42%, excluding Sound Solutions.  Our microelectronic mechanical (“MEMs”) microphones and SiSonic™ technologies were well positioned to capitalize on this market's growth as we have continued to invest in capacity to meet the growing market demands. We also experienced solid demand in the commercial aerospace market due to increased build rates of commercial aircraft by leading aircraft manufactures and increased demand for our aftermarket products globally. Our aerospace/industrial revenue (18% of 2011 segment revenue) increased $59.0 million, or 32%. This overall growth was partially offset by weakened demand in the global telecom markets, driven in part by deferred industry investment due to service provider consolidation. This contributed to a decrease of $7.2 million, or 3%, in our telecommunication/other revenue (17% of 2011 segment revenue).

Revenue derived from our defense market (16% of 2011 segment revenue) declined $8.2 million, or 4%, mainly due to timing and funding of certain programs.

Our life sciences revenue (18% of segment revenue) also declined by $16.4 million, or 6%, principally due to softer hearing aid demand in the first half of 2011 and overall softer medical equipment demand.

Communication Technologies 2011 earnings increased 10% compared with 2010, but operating margin declined 250 basis points. The margin decline mainly resulted from higher acquisition related costs including incremental depreciation and amortization, higher raw material costs, and lower margins from the integration of the Sound Solutions acquisition.  Excluding the impact of Sound Solutions, earnings would have increased by $36.6 million, or 18%, and operating margin would have increased by 160 basis points as compared with 2010.

Bookings and backlog at the end of 2011 indicate continued strength in the handset and aerospace markets as we head into 2012, offset by continued softness in the telecommunication market.

2010 Versus 2009

Communication Technologies 2010 revenue and earnings increased 18% and 44%, respectively, compared with 2009.  The increase in revenues was supported by organic revenue growth of 17% and growth from acquisitions of 1%, offset by a negligible impact from foreign currency translation.  The organic revenue growth was primarily driven by strong demand for MEMs microphones, hearing aid components and telecom infrastructure related products.  Earnings and operating margin in 2010 were favorably impacted by higher sales volume and production leverage, coupled with the absence of significant restructuring charges in 2010 and the benefit of 2009 restructuring programs.

2011 Versus 2010

Our Energy segment posted record organic revenue, earnings and bookings in 2011.  Revenue and earnings were up 46% and 43%, respectively, due to continued strength in the drilling, production and downstream energy markets served by the segment.  Recent acquisitions generated revenue growth of 19% and contributed to the segment’s record results. Sales outside of North America grew 35% driven by significantly higher sales to Central and South America, the Middle East and Russia.  Pricing actions, generally undertaken to offset commodity inflation, accounted for a marginal portion of the revenue increase. Production sector revenue (representing 51% of 2011 segment revenue) increased 72%, with 35% due to organic growth and 37% from acquisitions.  The organic growth was driven by higher drilling and well completion activity, increased international sales, and higher demand for winch products serving the energy, infrastructure and recovery markets.  Drilling sector revenue (21% of 2011 segment revenue) grew 34% due to increased exploration activity, pricing, and market share increases.  Our revenues in the drilling and production sectors are impacted by changes in the number of active North American drilling rigs.  The average North American drilling rig count in 2011 was up 21% over the prior year, driven by strong oil prices. Downstream sector revenue (28% of 2011 segment revenue) was up 20%, with 14% from organic revenue growth and the balance from recent acquisitions. The organic growth reflects continued strong demand for products in the power generation, rail, cargo tank and chemical/industrial markets, as well as nozzles and hanging hardware for retail fueling stations.

Energy earnings increased $134.5 million, or 43%, from the higher organic and acquisition volumes.  Energy operating margin declined 60 basis points compared to the prior year, due to the impact of acquisition-related costs, including higher depreciation and amortization, and higher material costs, partially offset by improved operating leverage associated with the higher volumes, strategic pricing and productivity gains.

Both bookings and backlog at the end of December increased significantly compared to the prior year, and we expect market conditions in 2012 to continue to be favorable for the Energy segment. The market compression of natural gas prices should not have a significant impact to our operations, as we expect the effects of the migration away from dry gas to be offset by increased oil and liquid rich gas activity.

2010 Versus 2009

Our Energy segment’s 2010 revenue and earnings increased 31% and 49%, respectively, compared with 2009.  Organic revenue growth of 25% was driven by a significant increase in active North American drilling rigs and market share gains in our drilling sector businesses. Increased drilling activity also favorably impacted our businesses in the production sector, particularly demand for sucker rods. The average North American drilling rig count in 2010 was up 45% compared to 2009. The 2009 Inpro/Seal acquisition contributed revenue growth of approximately 5%, and foreign currency translation favorably impacted revenue by 1%. The increase in earnings is the result of higher sales volume and benefits from productivity improvements and 2009 restructuring initiatives.

2011 Versus 2010

Engineered Systems 2011 revenue increased 11%, driven by organic revenue growth of 9%, favorable foreign currency of 1% and a negligible impact from recent acquisitions.  Revenue of our refrigeration & industrial platform, which serves our refrigeration and food equipment, waste and recycling, and other industrial end-markets, increased $205 million, or 9%.  Revenue from refrigeration and food equipment (representing 35% of 2011 segment revenue) increased $91 million, or 9%, reflecting strong demand for refrigeration systems fueled by remodel activity at major retail chains.  Performance by our businesses serving the waste and recycling and other industrial markets (43% of 2011 segment revenue) was driven by increased global demand for industrial automation machinery, improving demand for vehicle services in the important Asian markets and a market rebound in hydraulic equipment due in part to strength in the mining sector, partially offset by a double-digit decline in waste and recycling revenue given continued constraints on municipal spending.  These factors combined to increase other industrial revenue by $114 million, or 9%.

Revenue of our fluid solutions platform (22% of 2011 segment revenue)  increased by $110 million, or 19%, reflecting strong demand for pumps in the chemical, transport and hygienic markets and increasing demand for heat exchange systems, coupled with the benefits from  geographic expansion, particularly in Asia, and price increases necessary to cover rising commodity costs.

Engineered Systems segment earnings increased $62.5 million, or 16%, on the strength of increased volume.  Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points, as a result of positive pricing actions and productivity savings, which more than offset cost escalation and unfavorable product mix.

Bookings and backlog at the end of 2011 have increased compared to 2010 levels, driven by higher refrigeration, pump and heat exchange orders. We continue to invest in market leading technologies to better serve the refrigeration market, as we expect more economies to propose and pass carbon-limiting legislation in the coming years.  An example of this is our fourth quarter acquisition of Advansor A/S, which manufactures energy efficient transcritical CO


systems used in refrigeration systems.

2010 Versus 2009

Our Engineered Systems’ 2010 revenue and earnings increased by 21% and 37%, respectively, as compared with 2009.  Organic revenue growth of 16% was driven by higher sales volumes in refrigeration systems and vehicle service offerings, offset in part by softness in waste and recycling markets.  Earnings and margin were favorably impacted by increased volumes in high margin businesses, the absence of restructuring charges and the benefits associated with 2009 restructuring initiatives.

2011 Versus 2010

Our Printing & Identification segment’s 2011 revenue increased 8% compared with 2010, with 5% of the increase attributed to higher organic and new product volumes and 3% from favorable foreign currency impacts.  Price was slightly favorable, offsetting commodity inflation.  Electronics revenue (representing 42% of 2011 segment revenue) was up 11% versus the prior year, with strong first half growth of 50% driven by strong demand in the alternative energy and semiconductor markets, partially offset by a revenue decline in the second half of 17% as demand weakened in these same electronic markets. Additionally, we realized volume growth in our fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) (35% of 2011 segment revenue) and industrial products (23% of 2011 segment revenue), with combined 6% revenue growth year over year, driven by successful new product introductions that gained traction as the year progressed.

Printing & Identification earnings declined $11 million in 2011, resulting in an operating margin decline of 190 basis points.  The margin decline is primarily attributed to the second half reduction in alternative energy and semiconductor revenues which are typically higher margin activity, coupled with unfavorable regional mix due to weaker European markets for our FMCG, and key strategic investments for growth directed toward our FMCG, industrial and electronics end markets. We expect these investments to continue into 2012 as we consider these end markets integral to our longer-term revenue growth focus.  We also completed several small employee reduction in force programs across targeted businesses to streamline operations and to align more closely with our growth in geographic end markets.  Costs related to these programs were not significant.

Year-end 2011 bookings and backlog levels are down from the prior year, primarily due to the slowdown in electronics end markets, particularly alternative energy and semiconductor.  We currently expect these market conditions to continue through the first half of 2012.

2010 Versus 2009

Our Printing & Identification segment’s 2010 revenue increased by 30% compared with 2009, substantially driven by increased demand in all of its major product categories, including marking and coding and electronic assembly and board test equipment.  Demand was fueled by the economic recovery, increased semiconductor handling business, and growth in solar/alternative energy products.  Earnings in 2010 increased over 200% compared with 2009 primarily due to the favorable impact of product and geographic mix, the absence of restructuring charges and the benefits of 2009 restructuring initiatives.



FINANCIAL CONDITION

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.  We generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions, while managing our capital structure on a short and long-term basis.

Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased $156.4 million, primarily due to increased net earnings in 2011 and reduced investment in working capital relative to 2010.  Higher sales volume increased 2011 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by $256 million as compared with 2010.  Our investment in working capital was $151 million lower than in 2010, at which time a working capital build-up was necessary to support revenue levels recovering from the 2009 declines. These increases in cash flow were partially offset by $178 million of higher income tax payments resulting from our higher earnings and 2011 tax settlement activity, as well as higher employee incentive compensation payments and reductions in deferred revenue.

Cash provided by operating activities in 2010 increased $158.5 million from 2009.  Higher sales volume increased 2010 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by $354 million as compared with 2009. This was offset by a $220 million increase in working capital necessary to support the increase in 2010 order and revenue levels, compared to a $179 million decrease in working capital in the 2009 period when sales levels had declined. Other factors contributing to the 2010 increase in operating cash flows included $49 million less in restructuring payments, $21 million less of post-retirement plan contributions, and a $54 million increase in deferred revenue due to additional sales activity in the 2010 period.

Postretirement costs relating to pension and other employee-related defined benefit plans affect results in all segments. We recorded net periodic benefit cost of $40 million, $33 million and $37 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, relating to our benefit plans (including our defined benefit, supplemental and post-retirement plans).  The main drivers of expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long-term estimates, including expected returns on plan assets, the service cost and the interest cost.  In 2011, the actual return on U.S. plan assets increased, while returns on our non-U.S. plan assets declined, as a result of the different mix of investments in the plans.  In 2010, the actual return on plan assets increased, consistent with increased returns within the global equity markets.  In 2012, we expect our net periodic benefit cost to be approximately $48 million, with the increase compared to 2011 being attributed to higher amortization relating to unrecognized losses.

The funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates.  We contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements.  At December 31, 2011, the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit plans reflected underfunding by $75 million, which includes $12 million relating to the U.S. Dover Corporate Pension Plan and $63 million relating to our significant international pension plans, some in locations where it is not economically advantageous to pre-fund the plans due to local regulations.  The majority of the international obligations relate to defined pension plans operated by our businesses in Germany, the United

Kingdom

and Switzerland.  Cash contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $49 million, $38 million and $51 million, respectively. In 2012, we expect to contribute $20 to $40 million to our qualified defined benefit plans. See

Note 13 to

the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our post-retirement plans.

Adjusted Working Capital

In 2011, Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from 2010 by $207 million, or 17%, to $1.4 billion, which reflected an increase in receivables of $167 million, an increase in net inventory of $145 million and an increase in accounts payable of $105 million, generally due to additional working capital investment necessary to support the increased revenue levels and the impact of 2011 acquisitions.  Excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation of $16 million, Adjusted Working Capital would have increased by $63 million, or 5%.



Investing Activities

We used cash for investing activities of $1.0 billion in 2011 and $171.5 million in 2010, mainly for capital spending and acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of businesses. In 2011, our use of cash for investing activities also included a net payment of $18 million on the settlement of foreign exchange forward contracts which had served as hedges of a portion of our euro-denominated net investment.

Acquisitions

.  In 2011, we used cash of $1.4 billion to acquire nine businesses, including $401 million for Harbison-Fischer in the first quarter and $824 million for Sound Solutions in the third quarter.  In comparison, we used $104 million to acquire six businesses in 2010.

Capital spending

.  Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $271 million in 2011 and $175 million in 2010. The increase in 2011 capital spending reflects investment in capacity expansion within our businesses principally serving the high-growth energy drilling and handset markets.  In 2011, our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue were approximately 3.4%.  We expect capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue in 2012 to increase slightly, driven by capacity expansion to support our high-growth, high-demand energy and handset

markets

.

Proceeds from sales of businesses.

We generated cash of $517 million in 2011, primarily from the sale of Paladin Brands, Crenlo and Heil Trailer International, three businesses that had operated in our Engineered Systems segment.  This compares to net proceeds of $4.5 million generated by the sale of Triton in 2010.

Short-term investments.

We typically invest cash in excess of near-term requirements in short-term investments.  In 2011, we generated net proceeds of $124 million from the sale of short-term investments, which were used to fund a portion of the Sound Solutions acquisition. In 2010, our short-term investment activity generated net proceeds of $87 million.

We anticipate that capital expenditures and any acquisitions we make in 2012 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds, and if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper or through public debt markets.

Financing Activities

We used cash for financing activities of $50.5 million in 2011 and $304.8 million in 2010, mainly for purchase of our common stock and payment of dividends, largely offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from exercise of stock options.

Long-term and short-term debt

.  In 2011, we realized net proceeds of $789 million from the 4.3% 10-year Notes due 2021 and 5.375% 30-year Notes due 2041 issued in February, approximately half of which was used to repay $400 million of other borrowings, principally commercial paper used to repay the 6.50% 10-year Notes which came due earlier in February 2011 and to fund acquisitions made in the first quarter.

Treasury purchases

. We historically repurchase shares of our common stock in an amount at least equal to the number of shares issued under our equity compensation arrangements, and expect to continue with this policy.  We used $242 million for share repurchases in 2011 compared with $124 million in 2010.  During 2011, we repurchased approximately 4.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market, pursuant to the 10,000,000 share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in May 2007.  In 2010, we purchased approximately 2.3 million shares under the same program.  Approximately 2.5 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this 10,000,000 five year authorization as of December 31, 2011.

Dividend payments

.  Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $219 million in 2011 and $200 million in 2010.  Our dividends per common share increased 10% to $1.18 per share in 2011 compared to $1.07 per share in 2010.  This represents the 56

th

consecutive year that our dividend has increased.

Proceeds from exercise of stock options

. We received $40 million from employee exercises of stock options in 2011, compared to $80 million in 2010.  Since 2006, we have issued only stock-settled appreciation rights (“SARs”), and a greater portion of our 2011 exercise activity was related to SARs which do not require cash settlement.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Free Cash Flow

In addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure). We believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt, pay dividends, fund acquisitions and repurchase our common stock. For further information, see the Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7.

The following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities:

For 2011, we generated free cash flow of $786.4 million, representing 9.9% of revenue and 92.9% of earnings from continuing operations, while continuing to make investments necessary to support our growth.  Free cash flow in 2010 was $727.0 million or 10.9% of revenue, compared to $630.4 million or 11.8% of revenue in 2009. The full year increase in 2011 free cash flow reflects higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower investment in working capital, partially offset by higher tax payments in 2011.  In 2011, we made tax payments of approximately $281 million compared to $103 million in the prior year, with the 2011 increase resulting from the higher level of earnings, the timing of estimated payments, and the impact of certain changes in federal tax regulations. Free cash flow is also impacted by higher capital expenditures in 2011 necessary to fund expansion in our high-growth businesses. We expect to generate free cash flow in 2012 of approximately 10% of revenue, consistent with our historical performance.

The 2010 increase in free cash flow compared to 2009 reflects higher earnings from continuing operations offset by investment in working capital and an increase in capital expenditures. The 90 basis point decline in free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was the result of the significant reduction in working capital realized in 2009 coupled with lower revenue levels.

Net Debt to Net Capitalization

We utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason.  The following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:

Our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at December 31, 2011 primarily due to the use of cash and debt to fund acquisitions totaling $1.4 billion during the year.  Total borrowings increased by $380 million during 2011, primarily due to $789 million net proceeds received from the 4.3% 10-year Notes due 2021 and 5.375% 30-year Notes due 2041 issued in February, approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire $400 million of notes which came due earlier in February 2011.   In 2011, we also received cash proceeds of $517 million, primarily from the sale of three businesses.



At December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.2 billion, representing a decrease of $104 million, as compared with the 2010 balance including short-term investments.  Cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investment grade money market instruments with maturities of three months or less. We regularly invest cash in excess of near-term requirements in short-term investments, which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase greater than three months, up to twelve months.  We held no short-term investments at December 31, 2011.  At December 31, 2011, our total cash and cash equivalents included $600 million held outside of the United States.

We use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock. In November of 2011, we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks to replace our existing facility that was set to expire in November 2012.  Our new facility permits borrowings up to $1 billion, which is consistent with the facility we replaced, and expires on November 10, 2016. This facility is used primarily as liquidity back-up for our commercial paper program.  We have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so.  If we were to draw down a loan, at our election, the loan would bear interest at a Eurodollar or Sterling rate based on LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.565% to 1.225% (subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded our senior unsecured debt by S&P and Moody’s) or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility. Under this facility, we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. We were in compliance with this covenant and our other long-term debt covenants at December 31, 2011 and had a coverage ratio

of 14.3

to 1.  We are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants.

We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC with remaining capacity of $1 billion that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions.

At December 31, 2011, we have an outstanding floating-to-floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of $50 million in exchange for CHF 65.1 million.  In February 2011, we amended and restated the terms of the arrangement to extend its maturity date to October 15, 2015. This transaction continues to hedge a portion of our net investment in CHF-denominated operations. The agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and the effective portion of the change in fair value is reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings. The fair value at December 31, 2011 reflected a loss of $21.7 million due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar over the term of this arrangement.

In January 2011, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to purchase $350 million for €258.7 million, which were designated as hedging an equivalent amount of our euro denominated net investment.  The agreements qualified as net investment hedges with the changes in fair value being reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings. These arrangements were settled on April 4, 2011, at which time we realized a loss of $18.2 million, which is reported within the cumulative translation adjustment.

Our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing.  Our credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, were as follows as of December 31, 2011:

We believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $59.9 million outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions, which expire at various dates in 2012 through 2016.  These letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance, warranty and other performance obligations.  In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations, the probability of which we believe is remote.

We have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets, including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters.  We do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities.

Due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions, we are unable to estimate the timing of the related payments, if any, that will be made subsequent to 2012. These amounts do not include the potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts we report. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures, including information regarding contingencies, risk and our financial condition. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 1. The accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to GAAP and is consistently applied. We review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis.

·

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. The majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. Service revenue represents less than 10% of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed.

In limited cases, our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery, installation, testing, certification or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized.  We do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements.

Inventory for the majority of our subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by us to properly value inventory.  Businesses within our Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments tend to experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time.



·

We have significant tangible and intangible assets on our balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value. Our assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or, when indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate, or when a significant portion of a reporting unit is to be reclassified to discontinued operations, during the interim periods. We estimate fair value using discounted cash flow analyses (i.e. an income approach) which incorporate management assumptions relating to future growth and profitability. Changes in business or market conditions could impact the future cash flows used in such analyses. We believe that our use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. No goodwill impairment was indicated by the testing of our 17 identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value by at least 30% and, in most cases, significantly more.  If the fair value of each of the reporting units was decreased by 10%, the resulting fair value would still have exceeded the carrying value and no impairment would have been recognized.

·

The valuation of our pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates.  Annually, we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation. Our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit payment streams.  The plans’ expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates.  As disclosed in

Note 13 to

the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2011 weighted-average discount rates used to measure our qualified defined benefit, supplemental and other post-retirement obligations ranged from 4.45% to 4.85%, reduced from the 2010 rates, which ranged from 5.04% to 5.50%.  The reduced discount rates are reflective of the decline in global market interest rates over these periods.  A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the post retirement benefit obligations by approximately $32.3 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2011.  Our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.  A decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately $1.5 million.

·

We have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated, using more likely than not criteria, for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues that are currently unresolved. We routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves. Reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and our future taxable income levels. The provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes.

·

We have significant accruals and reserves related to the self-insured portion of our risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. We estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, our experience and relevant industry data. We review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience.

·

We have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense.  The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues. While we believe that the amount accrued to-date is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations.

·

Occasionally, we will establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation, in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These liabilities, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts.



·

We will from time to time discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, including goodwill, to their estimated fair market value. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. Fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similar-type entities. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates.

·

We are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and performance share awards. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of SARs and stock options granted to employees. The model requires that we estimate the expected life of the SAR or option, expected forfeitures and the volatility of our stock using historical data.  We use the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of performance share awards which also require us to estimate the volatility of our stock and the volatility of returns on the stock of our peer group as well as the correlation of the returns between the companies in the peer group. For additional information related to the assumptions used,

see Note 10

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2009-13, which amended existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenue-generating transaction where multiple deliverables exist and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.  We adopted the multiple element guidance of ASU 2009-13 effective January 1, 2011.  We do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements, so the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-14 which eliminates tangible products containing both software and non-software components that operate together to deliver a product’s functionality from the scope of then-current generally accepted accounting principles for software. We adopted ASU 2009-14 on a prospective basis, effective January 1, 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05 which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income.  ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.   This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of this ASU only requires a change in the format of the current presentation.  We adopted this guidance for our 2011 year-end reporting, presenting other comprehensive earnings in a separate statement following the statement of earnings.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09 which requires enhanced disclosures around an employer’s participation in multiemployer pension plans.  The standard is intended to provide more information about an employer’s financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan to help financial statement users better understand the financial health of the significant plans in which the employer participates. This guidance became effective for our fiscal 2011 year-end reporting.  Its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04 which was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements.  This guidance is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2012.  Its adoption is not expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08 which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test for goodwill impairment.  If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required.  Otherwise, no further testing is required. The revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.  However, an entity can choose to early adopt even if its annual test date is before the issuance of the final standard, provided that the entity has not yet performed its 2011 annual impairment test or issued its financial statements.  The adoption of this ASU is not expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements.



Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we also disclose non-GAAP information which we believe provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net debt, total debt, net capitalization, the net debt to net capitalization ratio, adjusted working capital, earnings adjusted for non-recurring items, effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items, revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, earnings, revenue or working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  We believe the (1) net debt to net capitalization ratio and (2) free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase our common stock.  Reconciliations of free cash flow, total debt and net debt can be found above in this Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. We believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital (also sometimes called “working capital”), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue.  We believe that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of our operational changes, given the global nature of our businesses. We believe that reporting organic or core revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions, provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.  We periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highly-rated, diversified counterparties.

Interest Rate Exposure

We may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.  As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts.  We issue commercial paper, which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates; however, maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact on our pre-tax earnings.

We consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely long-term and fixed-rate in nature.  Generally, the fair market value of fixed-interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.  A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by approximately $260 million.  However, since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturities, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position.

Foreign Currency Exposure

We conduct business in various non-U.S. countries, primarily in Canada, Mexico, substantially all of the European countries, Brazil, Argentina, Malaysia, China, India and other Asian countries.  Therefore, we have a significant volume of foreign currency exposures that result from our international sales, purchases, investments, borrowings and other international transactions.  Changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect our financial position and cash flows when translated into U.S. dollars.

We have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in non-U.S. operations. We may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into fair value hedges.  At December 31, 2011, we had one outstanding floating-to-floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of $50 million in exchange for CHF 65.1 million, which matures on October 15, 2015. This transaction hedges a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations.  The agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings, with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings.  The fair values at December 31, 2011 and 2010 reflected losses of $21.7 million and $19.8 million, respectively, due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar over the term of this arrangement.

Certain individual operating subsidiaries that have foreign exchange exposure have established formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value and/or cash flow hedging programs.  We have mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of our currency exposure through operation of non-U.S. operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local-currency based.  A change of 5% or less in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the translation of our balance sheet or statement of earnings.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

(All other schedules are not required and have been omitted)



MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.  In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on its assessment under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, management has excluded Harbison-Fischer Inc., Sound Solutions and Oil Lift, three companies acquired in purchase business combinations during 2011.  These companies are wholly-owned by the Company and their revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 represents approximately 4.7% of the Company’s consolidated total revenue for the same period and their excluded assets represent approximately 3.7% of the Company’s consolidated assets as of December 31, 2011.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which appears herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Dover Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dover Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their

operations

and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Harbison-Fischer Inc., Sound Solutions and Oil Lift from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2011. We have also excluded Harbison-Fischer Inc., Sound Solutions and Oil Lift from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. These companies are wholly-owned by the Company and their excluded assets and revenue represent approximately 3.7% and 4.7%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

-

Dover Corporation (the “Company”) is a diversified, multinational corporation that manufactures a broad range of specialized products and components and also offers related services and consumables. The Company also provides engineering, testing and other similar services, which are not significant in relation to consolidated revenue. The Company’s businesses are based primarily in the United States of America and Europe with manufacturing and other operations throughout the world.  In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company reorganized its businesses into four new business segments that are aligned with the key end-markets they serve.  As a result of this realignment, the Company reports its results in four segments, Communication Technologies, Energy, Engineered Systems, and Printing & Identification.  For additional information on the Company’s segments, see

Note 15

.

Principles of Consolidation

- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations of purchased businesses are included from the dates of acquisitions.  As discussed in Note 3, the Company is reporting certain businesses that were sold during 2011 as discontinued operations.  The assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of all discontinued operations have been separately reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Use of Estimates

-

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates may be adjusted due to changes in future economic, industry or customer financial conditions, as well as changes in technology or demand. Significant estimates include allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, net realizable value of inventories, restructuring reserves, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, pension and post retirement assumptions, useful lives associated with amortization and depreciation of intangibles and fixed assets, warranty reserves, income taxes and tax valuation reserves, environmental reserves, legal reserves, insurance reserves and the valuations of discontinued assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period that they are determined.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

-

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments which are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less.

Short-Term Investments

-

Short-term investments consist of investment grade time deposits that have original maturity dates at the time of purchase greater than three months, up to twelve months.  The Company’s short-term investments earned interest at the weighted average rate of 1.04% in both 2011 and 2010.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

–

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses as a result of customer’s inability to make required payments.  Management evaluates the aging of the accounts receivable balances, the financial condition of its customers, historical trends and the time outstanding of specific balances to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected in the future and records the appropriate provision.

Inventories

–

Inventories for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value.

Property, Plant and Equipment

-

Property, plant and equipment includes the historic cost of land, buildings, equipment and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment or, in the case of acquisitions, a fair market value appraisal of such assets completed at the time of acquisition.  Property, plant and equipment also includes the cost of purchased software.  Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts and the gain or loss realized on disposition is reflected in earnings.  Depreciation expense was $175,997 in 2011, $152,305 in 2010 and $146,534 in 2009 and was calculated on a straight-line basis for all periods presented. The Company depreciates its assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: buildings and improvements 5 to 31.5 years; machinery and equipment 3 to 7 years; furniture and fixtures 3 to 7 years; vehicles 3 years; and software 3 to 5 years.

Derivative Instruments

-

The Company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to various risks, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk.  The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and does not have a material portfolio of derivative financial instruments.  Derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at inception of the contract.

The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value.  For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the derivatives and of the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings and subsequently recognized in net earnings when the hedged items impact earnings.

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

-

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired.  Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives (primarily trademarks) are not amortized.  Instead, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate. The Company conducts its annual impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of each year.  As discussed in Note 3, in connection with the sale of its Paladin Brands business in the third quarter of 2011, the Company recognized an after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $76,072, representing a write-down of the carrying value of goodwill to fair value, or the anticipated sales proceeds. This impairment loss is recorded within discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.  No impairment was indicated for the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009.

Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two-step process.  Commensurate with the reorganization of its business units into four new segments in the fourth quarter 2011, the Company reassessed its reporting units and identified 17 reporting units for its annual goodwill impairment test.  Step one of the test compares the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method to its book value. This method uses the Company’s own market assumptions including projections of future cash flows, determinations of appropriate discount rates, and other assumptions which are considered reasonable and inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis. The projections are based on historical performance and future estimated results.  These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts.  Step two, which compares the book value of the goodwill to its implied fair value, was not necessary since there were no indicators of potential impairment from step one.  See Note 6 for additional details on goodwill balances.

Similar to goodwill, in testing its other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company uses a discounted cash flow method to calculate and compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its book value. This method uses the Company’s own market assumptions which are considered reasonable and inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis.  Any excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss.  No impairment of indefinite lived intangibles was indicated for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Other Intangible Assets -

Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist primarily of customer lists, unpatented technology, patents and trademarks.  These other intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 15 years.

Long-Lived Assets

- Long-lived assets (including intangible assets with determinable lives) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate.  If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is produced and compared to its carrying value.  If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.  There were no indicators of impairment noted during 2011.

Foreign Currency

-

Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries, where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have been translated at year-end exchange rates and profit and loss accounts have been translated using weighted average yearly exchange rates.  Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Earnings (Loss).  Assets and liabilities of an entity that are denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency are re-measured into the functional currency using end of period exchange rates or historical rates where applicable to certain balances.   Gains and losses related to these re-measurements are recorded within the Statement of Earnings as a component of Other Expense (Income), net.

Revenue Recognition

-

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. Service revenue represents less than 10% of total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed.  In limited cases, revenue arrangements with customers require delivery, installation, testing, certification or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized.  The Company does not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

Stock-Based Compensation

–

The principal awards issued under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans include non-qualified stock-settled stock appreciation rights and performance share awards.  The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award.  The value of the portion of the award that is expected to ultimately vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis, generally over the explicit service period of three years (except for retirement-eligible employees and retirees) and is included in selling and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  Expense for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is recorded over the period from the date of grant through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service.  See Note 10 for additional information related to the Company’s stock-based compensation.  At the time of grant, the Company estimates forfeitures, based on historical experience, in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest.

Income Taxes -

The provision for income taxes on continuing operations includes federal, state, local and non-U.S. taxes. Tax credits, primarily for research and experimen

tation and non-U.S. earnings, export programs, and U.S. manufacturer’s tax deduction are recognized as a reduction of the provision for income taxes on continuing operations in the year in which they are available for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are provided on temporary differences between assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes as measured by enacted tax rates expected to apply when temporary differences are settled or realized. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of those benefits is considered to be more likely than not. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for which realization is not assured. The Company has not provided for any residual U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as such earnings are currently intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S.

Research and Development Costs –

Research and development costs, including qualifying engineering costs, are expensed when incurred and amounted to $196,970 in 2011, $186,687 in 2010 and $172,075 in 2009.

Advertising –

Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and amounted to $40,195 in 2011, $34,903 in 2010 and $29,026 in 2009.

Risk, Retention

, Insurance -

The Company currently self-insures its product and commercial general liability claims up to $5.0 million per occurrence, its workers’ compensation claims up to $0.5 million per occurrence, and automobile liability claims up to $1.0 million per occurrence.  Third-party insurance provides primary level coverage in excess of these amounts up to certain specified limits. In addition, the Company has excess liability insurance from third-party insurers on both an aggregate and an individual occurrence basis well in excess of the limits of the primary coverage. A worldwide program of property insurance covers the Company’s owned and leased property and any business interruptions that may occur due to an insured hazard affecting those properties, subject to reasonable deductibles and aggregate limits. The Company’s property and casualty insurance programs contain various deductibles that, based on the Company’s experience, are typical and customary for a company of its size and risk profile. The Company does not consider any of the deductibles to represent a material risk to the Company. The Company generally maintains deductibles for claims and liabilities related primarily to workers’ compensation, health and welfare claims, general commercial, product and automobile liability and property damage, and business interruption resulting from certain events. The Company accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated.  As part of the Company’s risk management program, insurance is maintained to transfer risk beyond the level of self-retention and provide protection on both an individual claim and annual aggregate basis.

Reclassifications

–

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

–

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2009-13, which amended existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenue-generating transaction where multiple deliverables exist and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The Company adopted the multiple element guidance of ASU 2009-13 effective January 1, 2011 for new arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after that date on a prospective basis.  The Company does not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements, so the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-14 which eliminates tangible products containing both software and non-software components that operate together to deliver a product’s functionality from the scope of then-current generally accepted accounting principles for software. The Company adopted ASU 2009-14 on a prospective basis, effective January 1, 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05 which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income.  ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.   This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of this ASU only requires a change in the format of the current presentation.  The Company adopted this guidance for its 2011 year-end reporting, presenting other comprehensive earnings in a separate statement following the statement of earnings.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09 which requires enhanced disclosures around an employer’s participation in multiemployer pension plans.  The standard is intended to provide more information about an employer’s financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan to help financial statement users better understand the financial health of the significant plans in which the employer participates. This guidance became effective for the Company for its fiscal 2011 year-end reporting.  Its adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

– In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04 which was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements.  This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2012.  Its adoption is not expected to significantly impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08 which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test for goodwill impairment.  If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required.  Otherwise, no further testing is required. The revised standard is effective for Dover for its annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.  The adoption of this ASU is not expected to significantly impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Acquisitions

2011 Acquisitions

The following table details the acquisitions made during the year ended December 31, 2011.

Sound Solutions Acquisition

On July 4, 2011, Dover, through its subsidiary, Knowles Electronics, LLC, completed the acquisition of the Sound Solutions business line from NXP Semiconductors N.V (“NXP”).  The contractual acquisition purchase price of $855,000 was funded by cash on hand and is subject to working capital and other contractual adjustments.  As a result of this acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $280,000 of customer-related intangible assets (weighted average life of 11 years), $8,200 of trademarks (weighted average life of 15 years), and $7,689 of other intangibles (weighted average life of 10 years). This acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill totaling $443,088, of which approximately $302,000 is expected to be deductible under local taxing jurisdictions.  Sound Solutions, which manufactures dynamic speakers and receivers for handset and other consumer electronic markets, has been incorporated into the Knowles business within the Communication Technologies segment.  Knowles is a leading global microelectronic mechanical (“MEMS”) microphone supplier, and the acquisition enables Knowles to become a leading supplier of audio components to the handset market.  As such, the goodwill recorded through the acquisition reflects the value attributed to significant cost and global revenue growth synergies that the combined business expects to achieve.  As of December 31, 2011, the Company has received approximately $22,000 from NXP as settlement for working capital and other contractual adjustments and has a remaining receivable from NXP for approximately $40,000, reflecting estimated purchase price adjustments for post-acquisition contingencies, subject to final agreement.  The receivable is recorded within prepaid and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and is expected to be settled in the first quarter of 2012.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

Other Acquisitions

During 2011, the Company acquired eight other businesses in separate transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $557,931, net of cash acquired.  As a result of these acquisitions, the Company recorded $226,403 of customer-related intangible assets (weighted average lives of 12 years), $10,431 of  trademarks (weighted average lives of 11 years), $11,726 of patents (weighted average lives of 10 years),  and $11,837 of other intangibles (weighted average lives of  7 years).  These acquisitions resulted in the recognition of goodwill totaling $291,176, of which $4,780 is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  Each of these businesses manufactures products and/or provides services in the energy and fluid solutions markets, each growth areas for the Company. These businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations serving these markets, and the goodwill identified by these acquisitions reflects the benefits expected to be derived from product line expansion and operational synergies.

All of the 2011 acquisitions are wholly-owned, with the exception of TAGC Limited LLC in which the Company acquired a 60% controlling interest. The non-controlling interest in TAGC Limited LLC is not material.

The Company has allocated purchase price at the dates of acquisition based upon its understanding, obtained during due diligence and through other sources, of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. If additional information is obtained about these assets and liabilities within the measurement period (not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition), including through asset appraisals and learning more about the newly acquired business, the Company may refine its estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price more accurately; however, any such revisions are not expected to be significant.

The Consolidated Statement of Earnings includes the results of these businesses from the dates of acquisition. The aggregate revenue of the 2011 acquisitions included in the Company’s 2011 consolidated revenue totaled approximately $393 million.

2010 Acquisitions

During 2010, the Company acquired 100% of six businesses for an aggregate cost of $104,418, net of cash acquired. A summary of the acquisitions made during 2010 is as follows:

Pro Forma Information

In accordance with ASU 2010-29, “Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations,” the following unaudited pro forma information illustrates the effect on the Company’s revenue and net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, assuming that the 2011 acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of 2010 and that the 2010 acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of the preceding period.  As a result, the supplemental pro forma net earnings reflect adjustments to the net earnings as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for year ended December 31, 2011 to exclude $10,368 of acquisition-related costs (after-tax) and $6,357 of nonrecurring expense related to the fair value adjustments to acquisition-date inventory (after-tax).  The supplemental pro forma earnings for the comparable 2010 period were adjusted to include these charges. The 2011 and 2010 supplemental pro forma earnings are also adjusted to reflect the comparable impact of additional depreciation and amortization expense (net of tax) resulting from the fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets relating to 2011 and 2010 acquisitions.

Disposed and Discontinued Operations

2011 –

Management evaluates Dover’s businesses periodically for their strategic fit within Dover’s operations.  Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2011, the Company obtained approval from its Board of Directors to sell Paladin Brands and Crenlo LLC, two businesses within its Engineered Systems segment that served construction-related end markets.  The sale was completed in September and the Company received cash proceeds of $300,211 and recognized an after-tax loss of $65,927.  The loss includes an after-tax impairment charge of $76,072 representing a write-down of the carrying value of goodwill to fair value, as indicated by the anticipated amount of sales proceeds. This transaction generated a capital loss for tax purposes, and the Company established a valuation allowance of $10,675 for the U.S. federal portion of the capital loss carryforward that, at that point in time, was not more likely than not to be realized.

In the fourth quarter, the Company obtained approval from its Board of Directors to sell Heil Trailer International, a manufacturer of specialty transportation trailers and equipment within its Engineered Systems segment.  The sale was completed at the end of December and the Company received cash proceeds of $211,911, subject to final working capital adjustments, and recognized an after-tax gain of $63,343, which included realization of the $10,675 U.S. federal capital loss carryforward generated by the third quarter sale of Paladin and Crenlo.

The net earnings from discontinued operations of $53,621 reflects net earnings from operations generated by the three businesses sold in 2011, coupled with expense and accrual adjustments relating to other discontinued operations and tax benefits of $17,960 relating primarily to discrete tax items settled or resolved during the year.

2010 –

During the first quarter of 2010, the Company sold Triton, an operating company that had been reclassified from the Engineered Systems segment to discontinued operations in 2008, for net consideration of $7,498, resulting in a net after-tax current year loss on sale of approximately $13,100.  During the second and third quarters of 2010, the loss was increased by approximately $900, net of tax, upon settlement of a $1,500 working capital adjustment related to the sale. The net earnings from discontinued operations of $23,556 reflects net earnings from operations of the three businesses sold in 2011 and tax benefits of $11,597 driven primarily by discrete tax items settled or resolved during the year, offset by expense adjustments related to other discontinued operations.


–

During the first and fourth quarters of 2009, the Company recorded in aggregate, a $10,338 (after-tax) additional write-down to the carrying value of Triton. The write-down and other adjustments related to previously discontinued entities resulted in a net after-tax loss on sale of $11,170 for the year.  The net loss from discontinued operations of $16,985 also includes the net loss from operations generated by businesses sold in 2010 and 2011.

Summarized results of the Company’s discontinued operations are detailed in the following table:

Restructuring

From time to time, the Company will initiate various restructuring programs and incur severance and other restructuring costs.  Prior to January 1, 2009, the Company established reserves related to severance and  facility closings in connection with certain acquisitions, which were established through the purchase accounting for these acquisitions, as allowed under accounting guidance in effect at the time.  These reserves were substantially settled in 2010.

In late 2008, the Company announced plans to substantially increase its restructuring efforts in response to the significant decline in global economic activity at the time.  As a result, in 2009 the Company recorded restructuring charges totaling $67,322 for workforce reductions and facility rationalizations.  The majority of these activities were carried out in 2009.  Restructuring initiatives in 2010 and 2011 were minor, and the Company does not anticipate significant restructuring charges in 2012.

On November 10, 2011, the Company entered into a $1 billion 5-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the “Credit Agreement”) that replaced a facility with similar terms that was set to expire in November 2012.  At the Company’s election, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a Eurodollar or Sterling rate based on LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.565% to 1.225% (subject to adjustment based on the rating according the Company’s senior unsecured debt by S&P and Moody’s), or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the Credit Agreement.  In addition, the Credit Agreement requires the Company to pay a facility fee and imposes various restrictions on the Company such as, among other things, the requirement for the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. The Company primarily uses this facility as liquidity back-up for its commercial paper program and has not drawn down any loans under the $1 billion facility and does not anticipate doing so. The Company generally uses commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, funding of acquisitions and the repurchases of its common stock.

On February 22, 2011, the Company issued $450 million of 4.30% Notes due 2021 and $350 million of 5.375% Notes due 2041. The proceeds of $788,971 from the sale of the notes, net of discounts and issuance costs, were used to repay commercial paper, including commercial paper issued to repay the Company’s $400 million of 6.50% notes, which matured February 15, 2011, and for other general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Harbison-Fischer.

During the third quarter of 2010, the lender of a structured five-year, non-interest bearing amortizing loan originally due July 2011 called the loan, as permitted per the terms of the agreement.  As a result, the Company repaid the outstanding $51,214 balance and recognized a net loss on extinguishment of $4,343, recorded in other income.

At December 31, 2010, notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt within the Consolidated Balance Sheet included commercial paper of $15,000.  There was no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011. The weighted average interest rate for short-term commercial paper borrowings was 0.2% for both 2011 and 2010.

The long-term note borrowings presented above are net of unamortized discounts of $10,023 and $5,764 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The debentures presented above include unamortized discounts of $4,379 and $4,572 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The discounts are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the life of the issuances.  The notes and debentures are redeemable at the option of Dover in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price that includes a make-whole premium, with accrued interest to the redemption date.

Scheduled maturities of long-term debt for the years ending December 31 are as follows:

In order to manage this risk the Company has hedged portions of its forecasted sales and purchases, which occur within the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with currency forward or collar contracts designated as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had contracts with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts of $83,541 and $63,935, respectively, to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar, British pound, Singapore dollar, Chinese yuan and Malaysian ringgit. The Company believes it is probable that all forecasted cash flow transactions will occur.

The Company has an outstanding floating-to-floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of $50,000 in exchange for CHF 65,100. In February 2011, the Company amended and restated the terms of the arrangement to extend its maturity date to October 15, 2015. This transaction continues to hedge a portion of the Company’s net investment in CHF-denominated operations. The agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and the effective portion of the change in fair value is reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings. The fair values at December 31, 2011 and 2010 reflected losses of $21,656 and $19,774, respectively, due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar over the term of the arrangement.

In January 2011, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to purchase $350,000 for €258,719, which were designated as hedging an equivalent amount of the Company’s euro denominated net investment. The agreements qualified as net investment hedges with the changes in fair value being reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings (loss). These arrangements were settled on April 4, 2011, resulting in a loss of $18,211 being reflected within the cumulative translation adjustment.

The following table sets forth the fair values of derivative instruments held by the Company as of December 31, 2011, and 2010 and the balance sheet lines in which they are recorded:

The amount of gains or losses from hedging activity recorded in earnings is not significant and the amount of unrealized gains and losses from cash flow hedges which are expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months is not significant; therefore, additional tabular disclosures are not presented.  There are no amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and there are no credit risk related contingent features in the Company’s derivative instruments.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as the Company’s policy is to contract with highly-rated, diversified counterparties.

Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(ASC 820), establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

·

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

·

Level 2 inputs include inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of assets or liabilities.

·

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

The following table presents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:

Short-term investments consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturities between three months and one year and are included in current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Short-term investments are measured at fair value using quoted market prices. The derivative contracts are measured at fair value using models based on observable market inputs such as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; therefore, they are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

In addition to fair value disclosure requirements related to financial instruments carried at fair value, accounting standards require disclosures regarding the fair value of all of the Company’s financial instruments.

The estimated fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $2,679,793 and $1,976,363, respectively, compared to the carrying value of $2,187,252 and $1,807,476. The carrying value includes the portion that is due and payable in less than one year of $1,022 and $16,590 at December 31, 2011and 2010, respectively. The estimated fair value of the long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable, notes payable, and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their fair values as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

Equity and Cash Incentive Program

2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan

Under the Company’s shareholder-approved 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”), a maximum aggregate of 20 million shares were reserved for grants (non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, and performance share awards) to key personnel between February 1, 2005 and January 31, 2015, provided that no incentive stock options shall be granted under the plan after February 11, 2014 and a maximum of two million shares may be granted as restricted stock or performance share awards. The exercise price of options and SARs may not be less than the fair market value of the stock at the time the awards are granted. The period during which these options and SARs are exercisable is fixed by the Company’s Compensation Committee at the time of grant.  Generally, the stock options or SARs issued under the 2005 Plan vest after three years of service and expire at the end of ten years.  All stock options and SARs are granted at regularly scheduled quarterly Compensation Committee meetings (usually only at the meeting during the first quarter) and have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. New common shares are issued when options or SARs are exercised.

The following table summarizes the Company’s compensation expense relating to all stock-based incentive plans:

Since 2006, the Company has only issued SARs under the 2005 Plan and does not anticipate issuing stock options in the future.

Unrecognized compensation expense related to SARs not yet exercisable was $27,570 at December 31, 2011.  This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.  The fair value of SARs which became exercisable during the year was $21,202.   Cash received by the Company for stock options exercised during 2011 totaled $26,519.

Performance Share Awards

In May 2009, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the 2005 Plan allowing the granting of performance share awards that will become payable in new common shares upon achievement of pre-established performance targets. The changes to the 2005 Plan are detailed in the Company’s Proxy Statement dated March 24, 2009 under the heading “Proposal 2 — Proposal to Approve Amendments to the 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plans.” Performance share awards granted under the 2005 Plan are being expensed over the three year period that is the requisite performance and service period. Awards shall become vested if (1) the Company achieves certain specified stock performance targets compared to a defined group of peer companies and (2) the employee remains continuously employed by the company during the performance period.  Partial vesting may occur after separation from service in the case of certain terminations not for cause and for retirements.

In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company issued performance shares covering 44,751 shares, 68,446 shares, and 75,892 shares, respectively. The performance share awards are market condition awards and have been fair valued on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model (a binomial lattice-based valuation model) with the following assumptions:

* Under the terms of the performance share award, the actual number of shares awarded can range from zero to 200% of the original target grant, depending on Dover's three-year performance relative to the peer group for the relevant performance period. Awards vesting at the end of 2011, as shown above, are expected to be paid out at approximately 105% of their original target.

Unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested performance shares as of December 31, 2011 was $3,667, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years.

The Company also has restricted stock authorized for grant (as part of the 2005 Plan), under which common stock of the Company may be granted at no cost to certain officers and key employees. In general, restrictions limit the sale or transfer of these shares during a two or three year period, and restrictions lapse proportionately over the two or three year period.  The Company granted 55,200 and 15,500 restricted shares in 2011 and 2010, respectively.  No restricted shares were granted in 2009.

The Company has a stock compensation plan under which non-employee directors are granted shares of the Company’s common stock each year as more than half of their compensation for serving as directors. The Company issued the following shares to its directors during each respective year as partial compensation for serving as directors of the Company:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

As of December 31, 2011 the Company had non-U.S loss carry-forwards of $71.2 million.  The Company had loss carry-forwards for U.S. federal and non-U.S. purposes as of December 31, 2010 of $1.2 million and $52.7 million, respectively.  The entire balance of the 2011 non-U.S. losses is available to be carried forward, with $15.4 million of these losses beginning to expire during the years 2012 through 2031. The remaining $55.8 million of such losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

The Company has loss carry-forwards for state purposes as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 of $160.9 million and $211.8 million, respectively. The state loss carry-forwards are available for use by the Company between 2012 and 2031.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had U.S. foreign tax credit carry-forwards of $24.5 million, research and development credits of $3.9 million, and alternative minimum tax credits of $3.1 million. The Company had no U.S. foreign tax credit carry-forwards, research and development tax credit carry-forwards, or alternative minimum tax credits at December 31, 2011.

The Company maintains valuation allowances by jurisdiction against the deferred tax assets related to certain of these carry-forwards as utilization of these tax benefits is not assured for certain jurisdictions.

The Company has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries because such earnings are reinvested and it is currently intended that they will continue to be reinvested indefinitely. At December 31, 2011, the Company has not provided for federal income taxes on earnings of approximately $1.4 billion from its international subsidiaries.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

The Company files federal income tax returns, as well as multiple state, local and non-U.S. jurisdiction tax returns. The Company is no longer subject to examinations of its federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for years through 2008. All significant state, local, and international matters have been concluded for years through 2005 and 2003, respectively. While the Company believes additional uncertain tax positions will be settled within the next twelve months, an estimate cannot be made due to the uncertainties associated with the resolution of these matters.

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under operating leases, many of which contain renewal options. Total rental expense, net of insignificant sublease rental income, for all operating leases was $83,406, $71,392, and $70,438 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contingent rentals under the operating leases were not significant.

The aggregate future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases as of December 31, 2011 are as follows:

Guarantees

The Company has provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets, including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters.  The Company does not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and is not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities.

Litigation

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible parties.” In each instance, the extent of the Company’s liability appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other “potentially responsible parties” involved and is anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain current and former plant sites, in cooperation with regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses. These proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of use of the Company’s products, exposure to hazardous substances, patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. Management and legal counsel, at least quarterly, review the probable outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred and currently accrued to-date, and the availability and extent of insurance coverage. While it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal actions, in the opinion of management, based on these reviews, it is unlikely that the disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company offers defined contribution retirement plans which cover the majority of its U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries. The Company’s expense relating to defined contribution plans was $25,826, $21,748 and $13,109 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and employee compensation.  The Company also provides to certain management employees, through non-qualified plans, supplemental retirement benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law.

The Company also maintains post retirement benefit plans which cover approximately 1,589 participants, approximately 218 of whom are eligible for medical benefits.  These plans are effectively closed to new entrants. The post-retirement benefit obligation amounts at December 31, 2011 and 2010 include approximately $3,790 and $3,529 in obligations, respectively, recorded in discontinued operations.  The supplemental and post retirement benefit plans are supported by the general assets of the Company.

The Company’s discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit payment streams. The plans’ expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates.

For post-retirement benefit measurement purposes, an 8.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits (i.e., health care cost trend rates) was assumed for 2012. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5% by the year 2018 and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate assumption can have an effect on the amounts reported. For example, increasing (decreasing) the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase (decrease) the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 by $405 and ($389), respectively, and would have a negligible impact on the net post-retirement benefit cost for 2011.

Plan Assets

The primary financial objective of the plans is to secure participant retirement benefits.  Accordingly, the key objective in the plans’ financial management is to promote stability and, to the extent appropriate, growth in the funded status.  Related and supporting financial objectives are established in conjunction with a review of current and projected plan financial requirements.

As it relates to the funded defined benefit pension plans, the Company’s funding policy is consistent with the funding requirements of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) and applicable international laws.  The Company is responsible for overseeing the management of the investments of the plans’ assets and otherwise ensuring that the plans’ investment programs are in compliance with ERISA, other relevant legislation, and related plan documents.  Where relevant, the Company has retained professional investment managers to manage the plans’ assets and implement the investment process. The investment managers, in implementing their investment processes, have the authority and responsibility to select appropriate investments in the asset classes specified by the terms of their applicable prospectus or investment manager agreements with the plans.

The assets of the plans are invested to achieve an appropriate return for the plans consistent with a prudent level of risk. The asset return objective is to achieve, as a minimum over time, the passively managed return earned by market index funds, weighted in the proportions outlined by the asset class exposures identified in the plans’ strategic allocation.  The expected return on assets assumption used for pension expense is developed through analysis of historical market returns, statistical analysis, current market conditions and the past experience of plan asset investments. Overall, it is projected that the investment of plan assets within Dover’s U.S. Corporate Pension Plan will achieve a 7.75% net return over time from the asset allocation strategy.

Common stocks represent investments in domestic and foreign equities which are publicly traded on active exchanges and are valued based on quoted market prices.

Fixed income investments include U.S. treasury bonds and notes, which are valued based on quoted market prices, as well as investments in other government and municipal securities and corporate bonds, which are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

Common stock funds consist of mutual funds and collective trusts. Mutual funds are valued by obtaining quoted prices from nationally recognized securities exchanges. Collective trusts are valued using Net Asset Value (the “NAV”) as of the last business day of the year. The NAV is based on the underlying value of the assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. The value of the underlying assets is based on quoted prices in active markets.

The real estate funds are valued on an annual basis using third-party appraisals, with adjustments estimated on a quarterly basis using discounted cash flow models which consider such inputs as revenue and expense growth rates, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates. The Company believes this is an appropriate methodology to obtain the fair value of these assets.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.  Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The fair value measurement of plan assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) changed during 2011 due to the following:

Multiemployer Pension Plans

The Company, through its subsidiaries, participates in a few multiemployer pension plans covering approximately 100 employees working under U.S. collective bargaining agreements. None of these plans are considered individually significant to the Company.  Contributions to multiemployer plans totaled less than

$2 million

in each of the last three years, 2011 to 2009.

Revenue is attributed to regions based on the location of the Company’s customer, which in some instances is an intermediary and not necessarily the end user. Long-lived assets are comprised of net property, plant and equipment. The Company’s businesses are based primarily in the United States of America and Europe. The Company’s businesses serve thousands of customers, none of which accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenue. Accordingly, it is impractical to provide revenue from external customers for each product and service sold by segment.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL  DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31, 2011 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Controls

During the fourth quarter of 2011, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;

(ii)

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and

(iii)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management’s report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9B.  OTHER INFORMATION

Not applicable.
