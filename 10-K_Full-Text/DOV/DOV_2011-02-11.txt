Business
    Strategy

The Company operates with certain fundamental business
    strategies. First, it seeks to acquire and own businesses that
    manufacture proprietary engineered products and are leaders in
    four broad markets: Industrial Products, Engineered Systems,
    Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies. To ensure success,
    Dover companies place strong emphasis on new product development
    to better serve customers and expand into new product and
    geographic markets. Second, the Company’s businesses are
    committed to operational excellence, and to being market leaders
    as measured by market share, customer service, innovation,
    profitability and return on invested capital. Third, the Company
    is committed to an operating culture with high ethical
    standards, trust, respect and open communication, to allow
    individual growth and operational effectiveness. Fourth, the
    Company seeks to utilize its strong free cash flow in a balanced
    manner to grow its businesses and to increase shareholder value.

Management
    Philosophy

The Company’s operating structure of four defined industry
    segments and six core business platforms within those segments
    drives focused acquisition activity, accelerates opportunities
    to identify and capture operating synergies, including global
    sourcing and supply chain integration, and advances the
    development of the Company’s executive talent. The
    presidents of the Company’s operating companies and groups
    have responsibility for their businesses’ performance as
    they are able to serve customers by focusing closely on their
    products and markets and reacting quickly to customer needs. The
    Company’s segment and executive management set strategic
    direction and initiatives, provide oversight, allocate and
    manage capital, are responsible for major acquisitions, and
    provide other services.

In addition, the Company is committed to creating value for its
    customers, employees and shareholders through sustainable
    business practices that protect the environment and developing
    products that help its customers meet their sustainability
    goals. Dover companies are increasing their focus on efficient
    energy usage, greenhouse gas reduction and waste management as
    they strive to meet the global environmental needs of today and
    tomorrow.

Company
    Goals

The Company is committed to driving shareholder return through
    three key objectives. First, the Company is committed to
    achieving annual organic sales growth over the next three years
    (2011 through 2013) of 6% to 8%, complemented by
    acquisition growth of 3% to 5% over the same periods. Secondly,
    the Company continues to focus on margin improvement activities
    and to expand return on invested capital to effectuate earnings
    per share growth ranging from 10% to 13% on an annual basis.
    Lastly, the Company is committed to generating free cash flow as
    a percentage of sales in excess of 10% through disciplined
    capital allocation, productivity improvements and active working
    capital management. The Company supports these goals through
    (1) alignment of management compensation with these
    objectives, (2) well defined and actively managed merger
    and acquisition processes, and (3) talent development
    programs.

Portfolio
    Development

Acquisitions

The Company’s acquisition program has two elements. First,
    it seeks to acquire value creating add-on businesses that
    broaden its existing companies and their global reach,
    manufacture innovative components and equipment, specialty
    systems

and/or

support services, and sell to industrial or commercial users.
    Second, in the right circumstances, it will strategically pursue
    larger, stand-alone businesses that have the potential to either
    complement its existing companies or allow the Company to pursue
    a new platform. During the last three years (2008 —
    2010), the Company purchased 16 businesses with an aggregate
    cost of $436.6 million.

In 2010, the Company acquired six add-on businesses for an
    aggregate cost of $104.4 million. In 2009, the Company also
    acquired six add-on businesses, for aggregate consideration of
    $228.4 million (including $6.4 million of
    consideration paid in the form of common stock issued in
    connection with the acquisition of Inpro/Seal Company). In 2008,
    the Company acquired four add-on businesses for an aggregate
    cost of $103.8 million.



For more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past
    two years, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8. The Company’s future growth
    depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful
    businesses, as a substantial number of the Company’s
    current businesses operate in relatively mature markets. While
    the Company expects to generate annual organic growth of
    4% — 5% over a business cycle absent extraordinary
    economic conditions, sustained organic growth at these levels
    for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently
    each year.

Dispositions

While the Company generally expects to hold and integrate
    businesses that it buys, it continually reviews its portfolio to
    verify that those businesses continue to be essential
    contributors to the Company’s long-term growth strategy.
    Occasionally, the Company may also make an opportunistic sale of
    one of its companies based on specific market conditions and
    strategic considerations. During the past three years (2008-
    2010), the Company decided to reduce its exposure to small,
    lower margin operations and, accordingly, it discontinued one
    operation and sold seven businesses for aggregate consideration
    of approximately $100.8 million. For more details, see the
    “Discontinued Operations” discussion below and
    Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8.

for additional information on discontinued operations.

Raw
    Materials

The Company’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw
    materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished
    components, which are generally available from a number of
    sources. As a result, shortages or the loss of any single
    supplier have not had, and are not likely to have, a material
    impact on operating profits. While the needed raw materials are
    generally available, commodity pricing has trended upward over
    the past few years, particularly for various grades of steel,
    copper, aluminum and select other commodities. The Company has
    generally kept pace with or exceeded raw material cost increases
    using effective pricing strategies. During 2010, the Company
    experienced modest increases in commodity prices.

Research
    and Development

The Company’s operating companies are encouraged to develop
    new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products
    to satisfy customer needs, expand revenue opportunities
    domestically and internationally, maintain or extend competitive
    advantages, improve product reliability and reduce production
    costs. During 2010, the Company spent $193.5 million for
    research and development, including qualified engineering costs.
    In 2009 and 2008, research and development spending totaled
    $178.3 million and $189.2 million, respectively.



Our operating companies in the Product Identification platform
    and Electronic Technologies segment expend significant effort in
    research and development because the rate of product development
    by their customers is often quite high. The companies that
    develop product identification equipment and specialty
    electronic components for the life sciences, datacom and telecom
    commercial markets believe that their customers expect a
    continuing rate of product innovation, performance improvement
    and reduced costs. The result has been that product life cycles
    in these markets generally average less than five years with
    meaningful sales price reductions over that time period.

The Company’s other segments contain many businesses that
    are also involved in important product improvement initiatives.
    These businesses also concentrate on working closely with
    customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and
    market applications, and continuously improving manufacturing
    processes. Most of these businesses experience a much more
    moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is
    generally experienced by the Product Identification platform and
    the Electronic Technologies segment.

Intellectual
    Property and Intangible Assets

The Company owns many patents, trademarks, licenses and other
    forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over a
    number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various
    times over a number of years. A large portion of the
    Company’s intellectual property consists of patents,
    unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting
    trade secrets that its companies seek to protect in various
    ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and
    suppliers where appropriate. In addition, a significant portion
    of the Company’s intangible assets relate to customer
    relationships. While the Company’s intellectual property
    and customer relationships are important to its success, the
    loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships, or
    any group of related rights or relationships, is not likely to
    materially affect the Company on a consolidated basis. The
    Company believes that its companies’ commitment to
    continuous engineering improvements, new product development and
    improved manufacturing techniques, as well as strong sales,
    marketing and service efforts, are significant to their general
    leadership positions in the niche markets that they serve.

Seasonality

In general, Dover companies, while not strongly seasonal, tend
    to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters,
    particularly companies serving the consumer electronics,
    transportation, construction, waste hauling, petroleum,
    commercial refrigeration and food service markets. Companies
    serving the major equipment markets, such as power generation,
    chemical and processing industries, have long lead times geared
    to seasonal, commercial or consumer demands, and tend to delay
    or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with
    those market trends.

Customers

Dover’s companies serve thousands of customers, no one of
    which accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s
    consolidated revenue in 2010. Similarly, within each of the four
    segments, no customer accounted for more than 10% of that
    segment’s revenue in 2010.

With respect to the Engineered Systems, Fluid Management and
    Industrial Products segments, customer concentrations are quite
    varied. Companies supplying the waste handling, construction,
    agricultural, defense, energy, automotive and commercial
    refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers
    that are significant within those industries. This also tends to
    be true for companies supplying the power generation, aerospace
    and chemical industries. In the other markets served, there is
    usually a much lower concentration of customers, particularly
    where the companies provide a substantial number of products as
    well as services applicable to a broad range of end use
    applications.

Certain companies within the Electronic Technologies segment
    serve the military, space, aerospace, commercial and
    datacom/telecom infrastructure markets. Their customers include
    some of the largest operators in these markets. In addition,
    many of the OEM customers of these companies within the
    Electronic Technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to
    Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) companies.
    Other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid
    manufacturers, many of the largest global EMS companies,
    particularly in China, and major printed circuit board and
    semiconductor manufacturers.



Backlog

Backlog generally is not a significant long-term success factor
    in most of the Company’s businesses, as most of the
    products of Dover companies have relatively short

order-to-delivery

periods. It is more relevant to those businesses that produce
    larger and more sophisticated machines or have long-term
    government contracts, primarily in the Mobile Equipment platform
    within the Industrial Products segment. Total Company backlog as
    of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $1,409.5 million and
    $1,083.5 million, respectively.

Competition

The Company’s competitive environment is complex because of
    the wide diversity of the products its companies manufacture and
    the markets they serve. In general, most Dover companies are
    market leaders that compete with only a few companies, and the
    key competitive factors are customer service, product quality
    and innovation. Dover companies usually have more significant
    competitors domestically, where their principal markets are,
    than in

non-U.S. markets.

However, Dover companies are becoming increasingly global where
    more competitors exist.

Certain companies in the Electronic Technologies and Engineered
    Systems segments compete globally against a variety of
    companies, primarily operating in Europe and East Asia.

International

For

non-U.S. revenue

and an allocation of the assets of the Company’s continuing
    operations, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Most of the Company’s

non-U.S. subsidiaries

and affiliates are currently based in France, Germany, the
    United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and,
    with increasing emphasis, China, Malaysia, India, Mexico, Brazil
    and Eastern Europe.

Although international operations are subject to certain risks,
    such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and

non-U.S. governmental

restrictions, the Company continues to increase its expansion
    into international markets, particularly in developing economies
    in South America, Asia and Eastern Europe.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company’s operations are governed by a variety of
    international, national, state and local environmental laws.
    Dover is committed to continued compliance and believes its
    companies’ operations generally are in substantial
    compliance with these laws. In a few instances, particular
    plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative
    and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private
    parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of
    regulated substances. Where necessary, these matters have been
    addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance.

In 2010, the Company developed and implemented a process to
    conduct an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from its many,
    independently operated companies. In addition, the Company has
    evaluated its climate change risks and opportunities and is in
    the process of developing a strategy to manage these risks and
    opportunities. The Company plans to have this strategy completed
    in 2011, including clearly defined goals and objectives, along
    with prioritized programs and projects for achieving energy use
    and greenhouse gas emissions reductions.

All of the Company’s segments are investigating the energy
    efficiencies related to the operation and use of their products
    and services by customers. In some instances, Dover’s
    operating companies may be able to help customers reduce some of
    their energy needs. Increased demand for energy-efficient
    products, based on a variety of drivers (including, but not
    limited to, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) could result
    in increased sales for a number of Dover’s operating
    companies.

There have been no material effects upon the earnings and
    competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance
    with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the
    protection of the environment. The Company is aware of a number
    of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to
    reduce emissions in geographies where its manufacturing and
    warehouse/distribution facilities are located and has evaluated
    the potential impact of



these regulations on the its businesses. The Company anticipates
    that direct impacts from regulatory actions will be
    insignificant in the short- to medium-term. The Company expects
    the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation
    would be primarily indirect and would result in “pass
    through” costs from energy suppliers, suppliers of raw
    materials and other services related to its operations.

Employees

The Company had approximately 32,000 employees in
    continuing operations as of December 31, 2010, which was an
    increase of approximately 9% from the prior year end. The
    increase reflects additional headcount necessary to support the
    volume growth in 2010, as well as the impact of recent
    acquisitions.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The Company’s business, financial condition, operating
    results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors
    which could cause its actual results to vary materially from
    recent results or from anticipated future results. In general,
    the Company is subject to the same general risks and
    uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such
    as general economic, industry

and/or

market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural
    disasters, and their effect on global energy markets; possible
    future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide
    economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. The risk
    factors discussed in this section should be considered together
    with information included elsewhere in this

Form 10-K

and should not be considered the only risks facing the Company.

The Company has identified the following specific risks and
    uncertainties that it considers material:

•

The
    Company’s results for 2011 may continue to be impacted
    by current domestic and international economic conditions and
    uncertainties.

In 2011, the Company’s businesses may continue to be
    adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or
    declines in economic activity both domestically and
    internationally in those countries in which the Company
    operates. These circumstances will also impact the
    Company’s suppliers and customers in various ways which
    could have an impact on the Company’s business operations,
    particularly if global credit markets are not operating
    efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce. Such
    negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market
    conditions are beyond the Company’s control, are highly
    unpredictable, and can have an adverse effect on the
    Company’s revenue, earnings, cash flows and cost of capital.

•

Increasing
    product/service and price competition by international and
    domestic competitors, including new entrants and the ability of
    the Company to introduce new and competitive products could
    cause the Company’s businesses to generate lower revenue,
    operating profits and cash flows.

The Company’s competitive environment is complex because of
    the wide diversity of the products that its companies
    manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most Dover
    companies compete with only a few companies. The ability of
    Dover’s companies to compete effectively depends on how
    successfully they anticipate and respond to various competitive
    factors, including new products and services that may be
    introduced by their competitors, changes in customer
    preferences, and pricing pressures. If Dover’s companies
    are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of
    new products and services

and/or

identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or
    successfully introduce new products and services in response to
    such competitive factors, they could lose customers to
    competitors. If Dover’s companies do not compete
    effectively, Dover companies may experience lower revenue,
    operating profits and cash flows.



•

Some
    of Dover’s companies may not anticipate, adapt to, or
    capitalize on technological developments and are subject to the
    cyclical nature of their industries. These factors could cause
    these companies to become less competitive and lead to reduced
    market share, revenue, operating profits and cash
    flows.

Certain Dover companies, particularly in the Electronic
    Technologies segment, sell their products in industries that are
    constantly experiencing change as new technologies are
    developed. In order to grow and remain competitive, the
    companies in these industries must adapt to future changes in
    technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new
    products to address their customers’ changing demands.
    Also, a portion of the Electronic Technologies segment’s
    revenue is derived from companies that are subject to
    unpredictable short-term business cycles.

The Energy platform in the Fluid Management segment is subject
    to risk due to the volatility of energy prices, although overall
    demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global
    economic conditions and related energy demands. In addition,
    certain Dover businesses manufacture products that are used in
    or related to residential and commercial construction, which can
    be adversely affected by a prolonged downturn in new housing
    starts and other construction markets.

As a result of all the above factors, the revenue and operating
    performance of these companies in any one period are not
    necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating
    performance in other periods, and these factors could have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations, financial position and cash flows.

•

Our
    companies could lose customers or generate lower revenue,
    operating profits and cash flows if there are significant
    increases in the cost of raw materials (including energy) or if
    they are unable to obtain raw materials.

Dover’s companies purchase raw materials, subassemblies and
    components for use in their manufacturing operations, which
    exposes them to volatility in prices for certain commodities.
    Significant price increases for these commodities could
    adversely affect operating profits for certain Dover companies.
    While the Company’s businesses generally attempt to
    mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging
    or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be
    a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the
    ability to increase the prices of products, or they may be
    unable to increase the prices of products due to a
    competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors. In
    addition, while raw materials are generally available now, the
    inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect the
    ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand
    for certain products. Consequently, a significant price increase
    in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss
    of customers and adversely impact revenue, operating profits and
    cash flows.

•

The
    Company is subject to risks relating to its existing foreign
    operations and expansion into new geographical
    markets.

Approximately 46% of the Company’s revenues for 2010 and
    43% of the Company’s revenues for 2009 were derived outside
    the United States. The Company continues to focus on penetrating
    global markets as part of its overall growth strategy and
    expects sales from and into foreign markets to continue to
    represent a significant portion of its revenues. In addition,
    many of the Company’s manufacturing operations and
    suppliers are located outside the United States. The
    Company’s foreign operations and its global expansion
    strategy are subject to general risks related to international
    operations, including:

•

political, social and economic instability and disruptions;

•

government embargoes or trade restrictions;

•

the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

import and export controls;

•

limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;

•

transportation delays and interruptions;



•

labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;

•

increased compliance costs;

•

the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national
    operations; and

•

limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.

If the Company is unable to successfully manage the risks
    associated with expanding its global business or adequately
    manage operational risks of its existing international
    operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s growth strategy involving expansion into new
    geographical markets or the results of operations and financial
    position.

•

The
    Company’s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on
    cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency
    results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact the
    Company’s results of operations.

The Company conducts business through its subsidiaries in many
    different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates
    could have a significant impact on the reported results of
    operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A
    significant and growing portion of the Company’s products
    are manufactured in lower-cost locations and sold in various
    countries. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties
    and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to
    foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in
    currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Pound Sterling,
    Chinese RMB (Yuan) and the Canadian dollar, could cause
    fluctuations in the reported results of the Company’s
    operations that could negatively affect its results of
    operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain
    currencies such as the Euro and U.S. dollar potentially
    exposes the Company to competitive threats from lower cost
    producers in other countries such as China. The Company’s
    sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting
    purposes. The weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in
    unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign
    locations are translated into U.S. dollars.

•

The
    Company’s operating profits and cash flows could be
    adversely affected if the Company cannot achieve projected
    savings and synergies.

The Company is continually evaluating its cost structure and
    seeking ways to capture synergies across its operations. If the
    Company is unable to reduce costs and expenses through its
    various programs, it could adversely affect the Company’s
    operating profits and cash flows.

•

Failure
    to attract, retain and develop personnel or to provide adequate
    succession plans for key management could have an adverse effect
    on the Company’s operating results.

The Company’s growth, profitability and effectiveness in
    conducting its operations and executing its strategic plans
    depend in part on its ability to attract, retain and develop
    qualified personnel, align them with appropriate opportunities
    and maintain adequate succession plans for key management
    positions. If the Company is unsuccessful in these efforts, its
    operating results could be adversely affected.

•

The
    Company’s businesses and their profitability and reputation
    could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental
    and public policy changes (including environmental and
    employment regulations and tax policies such as export subsidy
    programs, research and experimentation credits, carbon emission
    regulations, and other similar programs), risks associated with
    emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and
    unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.

The Company’s domestic and international sales and
    operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local
    government laws (including environmental and export laws),
    regulations and policies. Failure to comply with any of these
    laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and
    non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to the
    Company’s reputation. In addition, the Company cannot
    provide assurance that its costs of complying with new and
    evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future
    laws, including environmental protection, employment, and health
    and safety laws, will not exceed its estimates. In addition, the
    Company has



invested in certain countries, including Brazil, Russia, India
    and China that carry high levels of currency, political,
    compliance and economic risk. While these risks or the impact of
    these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them
    could adversely affect the Company’s businesses and
    reputation.

The Company’s effective tax rate is impacted by changes in
    the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax
    rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets
    or changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other
    taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax
    rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and
    international authorities. If these audits result in assessments
    different from amounts estimated, then the Company’s
    financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax
    adjustments.

•

Unforeseen
    developments in contingencies such as litigation could adversely
    affect the Company’s financial condition.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are, and from time
    to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings
    incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries
    arising out of the use of their products, exposure to hazardous
    substances or patent infringement, employment matters and
    commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require
    significant expenses, divert management’s attention, and
    the Company may be required to pay damages that could adversely
    affect its financial condition. In addition, any insurance or
    indemnification rights that the Company may have may be
    insufficient or unavailable to protect it against potential loss
    exposures.

•

The
    Company’s revenue, operating profits and cash flows could
    be adversely affected if Dover’s companies are unable to
    protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property
    rights.

Dover companies own patents, trademarks, licenses and other
    forms of intellectual property related to their products. Dover
    companies employ various measures to maintain and protect their
    intellectual property. These measures may not prevent their
    intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated or
    circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual
    property rights are not highly developed or protected.
    Unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could
    adversely impact the competitive position of Dover’s
    companies and have a negative impact on their revenue, operating
    profits and cash flows.

•

The
    Company’s growth and results of operations may be adversely
    affected if the Company is unsuccessful in its capital
    allocation and acquisition program or is unable to divest
    non-core assets and businesses as planned.

The Company expects to continue its strategy of seeking to
    acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden its
    existing companies and their global reach as well as, in the
    right circumstances, strategically pursue large businesses that
    have the potential to either complement its existing companies
    or allow the Company to pursue a new platform. However, there
    can be no assurance that the Company will able to continue to
    find suitable businesses to purchase, that it will be able to
    acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing
    conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending
    acquisition. If the Company is unsuccessful in its acquisition
    efforts, then its ability to continue to grow at rates similar
    to prior years could be adversely affected. In addition a
    completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations,
    may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated, or
    may expose the Company to unexpected liabilities. Further, if
    the Company fails to allocate its capital appropriately, in
    respect of either its acquisition program or organic growth in
    its operations, the Company could be overexposed in certain
    markets and geographies. These factors could potentially have an
    adverse impact on the Company’s operating profits and cash
    flows.

The inability of the Company to dispose of non-core assets and
    businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within
    expected time frames could also have an adverse affect on the
    Company’s results of operations.

•

The
    Company’s borrowing costs may be impacted by its credit
    ratings developed by various rating agencies.

Three major ratings agencies (Moody’s, Standard and
    Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings) evaluate the Company’s
    credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high
    ratings for the Company’s long-term debt as of



December 31, 2010. Although the Company does not anticipate
    a material change in its credit ratings, if the Company’s
    current credit ratings deteriorate, then its borrowing costs
    could increase, including increased fees under the Five-Year
    Credit Facility and the Company’s access to future sources
    of liquidity may be adversely affected.

During 2010, the Company had a net reduction of 18 manufacturing
    and warehouse facilities reflecting the 2010 sale of a business
    (which had been discontinued in a prior period), along with
    other facility consolidations undertaken as part of the
    Company’s ongoing efforts to streamline operations. The
    Company’s facilities are

well-maintained

and suitable for the operations conducted.

During the summer of 2010, the Company completed the relocation
    of its corporate headquarters from New York City, and its
    four segment offices from other locations, to Downers Grove,
    Illinois. The move has consolidated the corporate and segment
    management teams into one location in order to improve
    communication and strategic decision making and facilitate
    performance efficiencies.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal
    proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites
    identified under federal and state statutes which provide for
    the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible
    parties.” In each instance, the extent of the
    subsidiary’s liability appears to be very small in relation
    to the total projected expenditures and the number of other
    “potentially responsible parties” involved and it is
    anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few
    of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing
    remedial activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with
    regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been
    established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are, and from time
    to time may become, parties to a number of other legal
    proceedings incidental to their businesses. These proceedings
    primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury
    arising out of the use of products of Dover companies, exposure
    to hazardous substances or patent infringement, employment
    matters and commercial disputes. Management and legal counsel
    periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings,
    the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred, the
    availability and extent of insurance coverage, and established
    reserves. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of
    these legal actions or any need for additional reserves, in the
    opinion of management, based on these reviews, it is unlikely
    that the disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters
    mentioned above will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash
    flows or competitive position.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Special
    Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader
    understand the results of operations and financial condition of
    Dover Corporation for the three years ended December 31,
    2010. The following MD&A should be read in conjunction with
    the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes
    which appear elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
    risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results could
    differ materially from those anticipated in these
    forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,
    including those discussed elsewhere in this

Form 10-K,

particularly in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and in
    “SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS” inside the front cover of this

Form 10-K.

OVERVIEW
    AND OUTLOOK

As the global economy strengthened in 2010, the Company
    experienced increased demand across most of its end-markets as
    well as higher bookings and backlog in all of its segments. In
    total, the Company’s consolidated revenue increased
    $1.4 billion, or 24%, over 2009 to $7.1 billion,
    inclusive of acquisitions. Furthermore, the Company successfully
    leveraged the structural improvements made over the last few
    years to expand consolidated gross profit margin by
    200 basis points to 38.3%, as compared with 2009. The
    Company generated free cash flow of $767 million,
    representing 11% of revenue and 108% of earnings from continuing
    operations, despite significant investments necessary to support
    the growing businesses. The Company deployed this cash in
    support of its growth strategies as well as continuing its

55-year

record of increasing its annual dividend to shareholders.
    Developing economies in Asia contributed 17% of 2010
    consolidated revenues, and the Company expects to continue its
    expansion into Asia and other growing markets.

Given this strong momentum entering 2011, along with the
    execution of its strategies around product innovation, global
    expansion, leveraging its scale and disciplined capital
    allocation, the Company believes it is well-positioned for solid
    growth in the future.

The Company estimates 2011 full year organic growth to be in the
    range of 6% to 8% (assuming a negligible impact from foreign
    currency) and acquisition related growth to be approximately 3%
    for transactions completed in 2010 and four acquisitions
    completed in January 2011, the largest being Harbison-Fischer,
    which closed on January 3, 2011. Based on these revenue
    assumptions and profitability expectations, the Company has
    projected that its diluted earnings per share from continuing
    operations for 2011 will be in the range of $4.05 to $4.25 and
    expects its earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of
    being higher in the second and third quarters.

Revenue

Consolidated revenue in 2010 increased $1.4 billion or 24%
    reflecting organic revenue growth of 20%, growth from
    acquisitions of 4%, and a negligible unfavorable impact from
    foreign currency translation. The organic growth reflects volume
    increases across all of the Company’s segments, driven by
    higher demand in the majority of the Company’s end-markets
    as the global economy continues to rebound. Revenues generated
    outside of the U.S. increased by 30% compared with 2009,
    with much of this growth generated in emerging economies of Asia
    and Latin America.

The $1.8 billion or 24% decrease in consolidated revenue in
    2009 reflected a 24% decline in organic revenue and a 2%
    unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially
    offset by 2% net growth from acquisitions. The decline in
    organic revenue reflected lower demand and sales volumes across
    all four business segments stemming from general unfavorable
    global economic conditions.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit increased $633.5 million or 30% in 2010
    compared with 2009, reflecting the increased sales volumes.
    Gross profit margin improved to 38.3% in 2010, a 200 basis
    point improvement over the 2009 gross profit margin of
    36.3%, reflecting the increase in sales volumes in 2010, the
    impact of lower restructuring charges on a comparative basis,
    and benefits realized from restructuring initiatives executed in
    2009 along with Dover productivity initiatives.

Gross profit decreased $630.9 million or 23% in 2009
    compared with 2008, consistent with the decline in revenue for
    the period. Gross margin as a percentage of sales remained
    essentially flat at 36.3% and 36.1% in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.



Selling
    and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses increased
    $186.6 million or 12% in 2010 compared with 2009 due
    primarily to general increases across the segments in support of
    higher volumes. As a percentage of sales, selling and
    administrative expenses declined to 23.8% in 2010 compared with
    26.2% in 2009. This 240 basis point improvement reflects
    the absence of significant restructuring charges in 2010 and the
    benefits realized from 2009 restructuring efforts, as well as
    leverage from the higher revenue levels partially offset by
    increased compensation costs.

Selling and administrative expenses decreased
    $189.6 million or 11% in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily
    due to decreased revenue activity, cost curtailment efforts and
    integration programs, partially offset by restructuring charges.
    Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue
    increased to 26.2% in 2009 from 22.5% in the prior year,
    reflecting reduced revenue levels and restructuring charges of
    $50.2 million.

Interest
    Expense, net

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 was $115.5 million, $116.2 million and
    $130.2 million, respectively. Interest income for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was
    $9.1 million, $15.8 million $34.2 million,
    respectively.

Interest expense, net, increased 6.0% in 2010 compared with
    2009, primarily due to reduced interest income in 2010 resulting
    from lower interest rates on the Company’s short term
    investment balances.

Interest expense, net increased 4.5% in 2009 compared with 2008
    due primarily to reduced interest income stemming from lower
    interest rates on cash and investments which more than offset
    the reduction in interest expense due to lower average
    outstanding commercial paper balances during the 2009 period.

Other
    Expense (Income), net

Other expense, net of $3.5 million in 2010 reflects
    $6.6 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange
    fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies
    other than the functional currency, coupled with a
    $4.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt, offset in part
    by royalty income and other miscellaneous non-operating gains.
    This compares to other income, net of $4.0 million in 2009,
    which reflects $6.0 million of net expense from foreign
    currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities
    denominated in currencies other than the Company’s
    functional currency, which was more than offset by a favorable
    insurance settlement and other miscellaneous non-operating
    gains. In 2008, other income, net of $12.7 million
    reflected net gains from foreign currency exchange fluctuations
    of $6.7 million, coupled with other miscellaneous
    non-operating gains.

Income
    Taxes

The effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2010 was
    23.5% compared to the 2009 rate of 24.4%. The effective tax rate
    was impacted by discrete items in both years. The effective tax
    rate for 2010 was favorably impacted by net discrete items
    totaling $38.5 million, arising principally from third and
    fourth quarter settlements with U.S. taxing authorities,
    coupled with the resolution of a foreign tax matter in the third
    quarter. The effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted
    by $31.6 million of net benefits recognized for discrete
    items in the second and fourth quarters of 2009. Excluding these
    discrete items, the effective tax rate for 2010 was 27.6%
    compared to 30.8% for 2009, the variance of which is primarily
    attributed to a more favorable mix of

non-U.S. earnings

in low tax rate jurisdictions in 2010. With the exception of
    contested matters, for which an estimate cannot be made due to
    uncertainties, the Company believes that additional uncertain
    tax positions will be settled in 2011.

The effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2009 was
    24.4% compared to the 2008 rate of 26.6%, reflecting the
    previously mentioned discrete items in the second and fourth
    quarters of 2009. The effective tax rate for 2008 was favorably
    impacted by $26.3 million of net benefits recognized for
    discrete items in the third and fourth quarters of 2008. The
    full year 2009 rate reflects the favorable impact of net
    benefits for discrete items and the favorable impact of a higher
    percentage of

non-U.S. earnings

in low tax rate jurisdictions. Excluding these discrete items,
    the effective tax rate for 2009 was 30.8% compared to 29.3% for
    2008.



Net
    Earnings

Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 were
    $700.1 million or $3.70 dilutive earnings per share
    (“EPS”) including a loss from discontinued operations
    of $7.8 million or $0.04 EPS, compared to net earnings of
    $356.4 million or $1.91 dilutive EPS for the same period of
    2009, including a loss from discontinued operations of
    $15.5 million or $0.08 EPS.

The loss from discontinued operations in 2010 includes a loss of
    approximately $14.2 million, net of tax, related to the
    sale of a business that had been previously reflected as a
    discontinued operation as well as other expense and accrual
    adjustments relating to other previously discontinued
    operations. These losses and expenses were offset in part by tax
    benefits, which included approximately $11.6 million
    relating to discrete tax items settled or resolved during the
    third and fourth quarters. The loss from discontinued operations
    in 2009 includes approximately $10.3 million, net of tax,
    related to a write-down of a business held for sale. Refer to
    Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information on disposed and discontinued operations.

Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 were
    $356.4 million or $1.91 dilutive EPS including a loss from
    discontinued operations of $15.5 million or $0.08 EPS,
    compared to net earnings of $590.8 million or $3.12
    dilutive EPS for the same period of 2008, including a loss from
    discontinued operations of $103.9 million or $0.55 EPS. As
    noted above, the loss from discontinued operations in 2009
    includes approximately $10.3 million, net of tax, related
    to a write-down of a business held for sale. The loss from
    discontinued operations in 2008 largely reflects a loss
    provision for a business held for sale, as well as tax expenses
    and tax accruals related to ongoing federal tax settlements and
    state tax assessments.

In addition to these factors, 2009 earnings across all platforms
    were also negatively impacted by restructuring charges as noted
    below, while 2010 earnings reflect the benefits captured from
    the businesses’ restructuring and integration programs
    initiated in 2008 and 2009.

Severance
    and Exit Reserves

In late 2008, the Company launched various synergy capture
    programs and restructuring initiatives in response to the
    weakening global economic environment. In 2008 and 2009, the
    Company recorded restructuring charges of $27.4 million and
    $72.1 million, respectively, relating to these programs.
    These programs were largely executed throughout 2009, and the
    Company realized incremental savings of approximately
    $125 million and $32 million in 2009 and 2010,
    respectively. During 2009, the Company had a net reduction in
    its workforce of approximately 2,950, or 9%, and a net reduction
    of 23 manufacturing and warehouse facilities, as a result of
    these strategic restructuring efforts.

By 2010, the Company completed the majority of the initiatives
    launched in 2008 and 2009 and initiated a few targeted facility
    consolidations at its operating companies, resulting in
    restructuring charges of $6.2 million, a significant
    decline compared to the previous two years. The remaining exit
    reserves of $6.8 million at December 31, 2010 relate
    primarily to lease commitment obligations in connection with the
    prior years’ restructuring activities.

The Company does not expect to undertake significant
    restructuring activities in 2011, but will continue to monitor
    business activity across its markets served and adjust capacity
    as necessary depending on the economic climate.

    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows

Prior to January 1, 2009, the Company had established
    reserves related to severance and facility closings in
    connection with certain acquisitions, which were established
    through the purchase accounting for these acquisitions, as
    allowed under accounting guidance in effect at the time. The
    restructuring reserve balances at December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007 include $0.9 million, $27.9 million and
    $26.8 million for acquisition-related restructuring
    accruals that were established in purchase accounting. These
    reserves were substantially settled in 2010.

    Versus 2009

Industrial Products 2010 revenue and earnings increased by 14%
    and 62%, respectively, as compared with 2009 primarily due to
    broad-based revenue growth in material handling businesses and
    more modest growth in mobile equipment businesses. The revenue
    increase was predominantly attributed to organic revenue growth,
    with nominal 2010 revenue growth from the acquisition of Gear
    Products in the third quarter by Tulsa Winch in the
    segment’s Material Handling platform.

Earnings and margin were favorably impacted by increased volume
    in high margin businesses, the absence of restructuring charges
    and the benefits associated with prior year restructuring
    initiatives.

Material Handling 2010 revenue increased 29% while earnings
    increased over 200% when compared with the prior year. Revenue
    improvements were experienced across the platform, including
    modest improvements in those businesses with commercial
    construction exposure, driven by increased activity across most
    end-markets. Improvements in the energy and infrastructure
    end-markets, along with modest automotive market recovery,
    particularly outside the U.S., contributed to backlog levels at
    the end of 2010 which were 42% higher than 2009 year-end
    levels. Earnings and operating margin improved due to the
    increased sales volume, coupled with the absence of
    restructuring charges in the current period and the benefits
    associated with prior year restructuring initiatives.



Mobile Equipment 2010 revenue and earnings each increased 3% as
    compared with the prior year. The revenue growth was generated
    primarily by the vehicle service business, offset in part by
    softness in bulk trailer and refuse vehicle markets.
    Earnings and operating margin at the platform level were
    favorably impacted by the absence of significant restructuring
    charges in the current period coupled with the benefits achieved
    from restructuring initiatives taken in the prior year; however,
    this was substantially offset by the impact of unfavorable
    product mix in the period.

    Versus 2008

Industrial Products 2009 revenue and earnings decreased by 34%
    and 53%, respectively, compared with 2008, primarily due to
    general economic conditions as well as the continued downturn in
    infrastructure, energy, and transportation markets. The segment
    decline in revenue primarily reflected a core business decrease
    of 33% and an unfavorable impact of 1% due to foreign exchange.
    Earnings and margin were impacted by decreased revenue and
    $17.5 million in restructuring charges. The segment
    experienced modest improvement in commercial activity across
    markets served during the fourth quarter of 2009.

Material Handling revenue and earnings decreased 42% and 73%,
    respectively, when compared to the prior year. The platform
    experienced significant challenges in its core infrastructure,
    automotive, construction equipment and energy markets, which
    were partially offset by an increase in military demand. The
    decrease in revenue coupled with restructuring charges of
    $11.0 million negatively impacted earnings. Although
    bookings were down 47% as compared to 2008, the platform’s
    served end-markets stabilized in the fourth quarter.

Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings decreased 27% and 29%,
    respectively, over the prior year. The strength of the military
    market during the year was offset by challenges in the energy,
    bulk transport and vehicle service markets. Earnings at the
    platform were primarily impacted by lower revenue and
    restructuring charges of $6.5 million.

    Versus 2009

Engineered Systems 2010 revenue and earnings increased by 20%
    and 33%, respectively, compared with 2009. The improvement in
    revenue was the result of a 12% increase in organic business
    revenue and an 8% increase from acquisitions completed in 2010
    and 2009. The revenue and earnings increases were substantially
    driven by strength in Hill Phoenix, Direct Coding and Belvac
    volumes, including acquisitions, coupled with the benefits from
    prior year restructuring activities, which more than offset
    higher commodity costs and unfavorable mix.

Engineered Products 2010 revenue and earnings increased by 26%
    and 30%, respectively, compared with 2009. Organic business
    revenue increased approximately 13% driven by higher sales
    volume at Hill Phoenix and Belvac, while growth from
    acquisitions completed in 2010 and 2009 contributed 13% to
    revenue growth and was accretive to 2010 earnings. The
    platform’s earnings were favorably impacted by the higher
    sales volumes and contribution from prior year restructuring
    activities, partly offset by higher material costs and
    unfavorable product and customer mix.

Product Identification 2010 revenue and earnings increased 11%
    and 31%, respectively, compared with 2009, with growth driven by
    organic sales volume growth and benefit from the 2009
    acquisition of Extech Instruments. The platform’s earnings
    reflect continued investment in research and development, the
    favorable impact of product and geographic mix, the absence of
    restructuring charges and the benefits of prior year
    restructuring initiatives.

    Versus 2008

Engineered Systems 2009 revenue and earnings decreased by 7% and
    18%, respectively, compared with 2008. The decline in revenue
    was primarily driven by an 11% decline in core business revenue
    (excluding acquisitions) as a result of general softness in the
    markets served by the segment and an unfavorable impact of
    foreign exchange of 3%. The acquisitions of Tyler, Ala Cart,
    Inc. and Barker Company in the Engineered Products platform and
    Extech Instruments in the Product Identification platform
    accounted for 7% revenue growth. The earnings decline was
    substantially driven by softness in most end markets served,
    $18.4 million of restructuring charges and
    $6.2 million of acquisition related expenses.

Engineered Products 2009 revenue and earnings decreased by 2%
    and 10%, respectively, compared with 2008. Lower sales volume
    throughout our core businesses (most notably refrigeration
    equipment) were partially offset by acquisition revenue. The
    earnings decline resulted from lower sales volume in commercial
    cooling, HVAC and packaging equipment, restructuring charges of
    $6.9 million and $6.2 million of acquisition related
    expenses.

Product Identification 2009 revenue and earnings declined 13%
    and 18%, respectively, compared with 2008. Core revenue
    decreased 10% due to lower sales volume in the Direct Marketing
    and Bar Coding business with the balance of the revenue decline
    due to foreign exchange. The platform incurred
    $11.5 million in restructuring charges during the year.

    Versus 2009

Fluid Management 2010 revenue and earnings increased by 29% and
    50%, respectively, compared with 2009. The improvement in
    revenue was driven by a 25% increase in core business revenue
    and a 4% increase from acquisitions completed in 2009 and 2010,
    along with a nominal impact from favorable foreign currency
    translation. The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to
    continued recovery in the oil and gas markets served by the
    Energy platform as well as in the industrial markets served by
    the Fluid Solutions platform, along with market share gains at
    select operating companies. Segment earnings and operating
    margin reflect the benefit of higher sales volumes, productivity
    improvements and favorable product mix.

The Energy platform’s 2010 revenue and earnings increased
    42% and 63%, respectively, compared with 2009. Organic revenue
    growth of 34% was driven by higher demand and market share gains
    in the oil and gas sector, which experienced a significant
    increase in active North American drilling rigs. The 2009
    Inpro/Seal acquisition contributed revenue growth of
    approximately 7%, and foreign currency translation favorably
    impacted revenue by 1%. The increase in earnings is the result
    of higher sales volume and benefits from productivity
    improvements and 2009 restructuring initiatives.

The Fluid Solutions platform revenue and earnings increased 17%
    and 31%, respectively, compared with 2009 due to higher demand
    in substantially all end-markets, including chemical, sanitary,
    transportation, retail fueling and life sciences. Earnings were
    favorably impacted by the increased volumes and productivity
    improvements.



    Versus 2008

Fluid Management 2009 revenue and earnings decreased by 26% and
    33%, respectively, compared with 2008. The decline in revenue
    was primarily driven by a 25% decline in core business revenue
    and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2%. The decline
    in revenue was partially offset by growth of 1% from the full
    year effect of 2008 acquisitions and a 2009 acquisition. The
    earnings decline was driven by reduced revenue,
    $9.7 million in restructuring charges and acquisition
    related expenses of $2.5 million.

The Energy platform’s 2009 revenue and earnings decreased
    33% and 38%, respectively, compared with 2008. The decline in
    revenue was a result of lower demand in the oil, gas and power
    generation industries, partially offset by the impact of 2008
    and 2009 acquisitions. The platform experienced a recent
    increase in revenue growth stemming from increases in active
    North American drilling rigs. The decrease in earnings was a
    result of lower sales volume, restructuring charges of
    $3.0 million and acquisition related expenses of
    $2.5 million, partially offset by operational improvements
    and cost savings as a result of restructuring activities.
    Waukesha Bearings acquired Inpro/Seal Company on
    December 30, 2009, which accounted for the majority of the
    acquisition costs.

The Fluid Solutions 2009 platform revenue and earnings decreased
    17% and 20%, respectively, compared with 2008 due to lower
    demand in its various industrial markets served. Decreased
    earnings reflected lower sales volume and $6.7 million of
    restructuring charges.

    Versus 2009

Electronic Technologies 2010 revenue and earnings increased 39%
    and 199%, respectively, compared with 2009. The increase in
    revenues was supported by organic revenue growth of 39% and
    growth from acquisitions of 1%, offset by a 1% unfavorable
    impact from foreign currency translation. The organic revenue
    growth was primarily driven by strong demand for electronic
    assembly equipment, Micro Electronic Mechanical Systems
    (“MEMS”) microphones, hearing aid components and
    telecom infrastructure related products. Demand also continues
    to grow for the segment’s emerging solar products. Revenue
    from the electronic assembly equipment companies increased 77%,
    while revenue of the communication component companies increased
    20% compared with 2009. Earnings and operating margin in 2010
    were favorably impacted by higher sales volume and production
    leverage, coupled with the absence of significant restructuring
    charges in the current year and the benefit of prior year
    restructuring programs.

    Versus 2008

Electronic Technologies 2009 revenue and earnings decreased 26%
    and 57%, respectively, compared with 2008 primarily driven by
    weak demand for telecom components and electronic assembly and
    test equipment. The decline in core revenue was 24% and there
    was a 2% unfavorable impact on revenue from foreign exchange.
    MEMS products continued to show increased customer adoption,
    while military and space programs continued to provide a



constructive business climate for the segment’s electronic
    component companies. Earnings in 2009 were negatively impacted
    by lower sales volume and $26.6 million of restructuring
    charges. In addition, the comparability of 2009 earnings was
    impacted by the favorable impact of 2008 earnings, which
    included a $7.5 million gain on the sale of a business
    (semi-conductor test handling).

    investors for the same reason. The following table provides a

The Company’s net debt to net capitalization levels
    improved during 2010, primarily as a result of cash generated
    from operations and lower levels of acquisition investments. In
    addition, long-term debt decreased due to scheduled repayments,
    coupled with the early extinguishment of a structured
    non-interest bearing loan in the third quarter.

At December 31, 2010, the Company’s cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments totaled
    $1.3 billion, representing an increase of
    $371 million, as compared with the 2009 balance. Cash and
    equivalents are invested in highly liquid investment grade money
    market instruments with maturities of three months or less. The
    Company regularly invests cash in excess of near-term
    requirements in short-term investments, which consist of
    investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at
    the time of purchase greater than three months, up to twelve
    months. At December 31, 2010, the Company’s total
    cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments included
    $1.2 billion held outside of the United States, and the
    Company intends to use a significant portion of this to fund the
    Sound Solutions acquisition, as described in Note 17 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Free
    Cash Flow

In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage
    based upon the operating, investing and financing
    classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows (as analyzed in the sections below), the Company also
    measures free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure). Management
    believes that free cash flow is an important measure of
    operating performance because it provides management and
    investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that
    is available to repay debt, pay dividends, fund acquisitions and
    repurchase the Company’s common stock. For further
    information, see Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this
    Item 7.

Free cash flow in 2010 was $767.3 million or 10.8% of
    revenue, compared to $682.1 million or 11.8% of revenue in
    2009 and $834.6 million or 11.0% of revenue in 2008. The
    2010 increase in free cash flow compared to 2009 reflects higher
    earnings from continuing operations offset by investment in
    working capital and an increase in capital expenditures as
    compared to the prior year. The 100 basis point decline in
    free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was the result of the
    significant reduction in working capital realized in 2009
    coupled with lower revenue levels.

The 2009 decrease in free cash flow compared to 2008 reflected
    lower earnings from continuing operations and higher employee
    benefit contributions partially offset by improvements in
    working capital and a decrease in capital expenditures. The
    increase in free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was due to
    active management of adjusted working capital in a lower revenue
    environment.

The Company uses commercial paper borrowings for general
    corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and
    the repurchase of its common stock. The Company currently
    maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility with a
    syndicate of banks which permits borrowings up to
    $1 billion, which expires on November 9, 2012. This
    facility is used primarily as liquidity

back-up

for
    the Company’s commercial paper program. The Company has not
    drawn down any loans under this facility nor does it anticipate
    doing so. If the Company were to draw down a loan, at the
    Company’s election, the loan would bear interest at a
    Eurodollar or Sterling rate based on LIBOR, plus an applicable
    margin ranging from 0.13% to 0.35% (subject to adjustment based
    on the rating accorded the Company’s senior unsecured debt
    by S&P and Moody’s) or at a base rate pursuant to a
    formula defined in the facility. Under this facility, the
    Company is required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of
    EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.5
    to 1. The Company was in compliance with this covenant and its
    other long-term debt covenants at December 31, 2010 and had
    a coverage ratio of 12.1 to 1. The Company is not aware of any
    potential impairment to its liquidity and expects to remain in
    compliance with all of its debt covenants.

The Company also has a current shelf registration statement
    filed with the SEC, with remaining capacity of
    $600 million, that allows for the issuance of additional
    debt securities that may be offered in one or more offerings on
    terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds
    of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes,
    including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital
    expenditures and acquisitions.

The Company has a $400 million face value note issuance
    coming due on February 15, 2011. This amount is classified
    as long-term within the consolidated balance sheet at
    December 31, 2010, as the Company has the ability and
    intends to refinance this debt on a long-term basis.

At December 31, 2010, the Company also had an outstanding

floating-to-floating

cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of
    $50 million in exchange for CHF 65.1 million, which
    matures on February 15, 2011. This transaction hedges a
    portion of the Company’s net investment in

non-U.S. operations.

The agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in
    the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation
    adjustment section of other comprehensive income, with any hedge
    ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings. The fair
    values at December 31, 2010 and 2009 reflected losses of
    $19.8 million and $13.3 million, respectively, due to
    the strengthening of the Swiss franc relative to the
    U.S. dollar over the term of this arrangement. Prior to
    this hedge maturing, the Company intends to assess market
    conditions and make a decision as to whether to settle the
    liability with available sources of liquidity or renew the hedge
    arrangement.

The Company’s ability to obtain debt financing at
    comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of its
    existing cash-flow-to-debt and

debt-to-capitalization

levels as well as its current credit standing. The
    Company’s



credit ratings, which are independently developed by the
    respective rating agencies, were as follows as of
    December 31, 2010:

The Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are
    adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable
    risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future.
    Acquisition spending

and/or

share
    repurchases could potentially increase the Company’s debt.
    However, management anticipates that the net debt to net
    capitalization ratio will remain generally consistent with the
    historical range of 25%-30%. Operating cash flow and access to
    capital markets are expected to satisfy the Company’s
    various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and
    capital expenditures.

Management also assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms
    of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing
    and financing activities. Significant factors affecting
    liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities,
    capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends,
    repurchases of outstanding shares, adequacy of available
    commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to
    attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. The Company
    generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a
    strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available
    for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic
    acquisitions while managing its capital structure on a short and
    long-term basis.

Operating
    Activities

Cash provided by operating activities in 2010 increased
    $148.5 million from 2009. Higher sales volume increased
    2010 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by
    $354 million as compared with 2009. This was offset by a
    $223 million increase in working capital necessary to
    support the increase in 2010 order and revenue levels, compared
    to a $229 million decrease in working capital in the 2009
    period when sales levels had declined. Other factors
    contributing to the 2010 increase in operating cash flows
    included $52 million less in restructuring payments,
    $21 million less of post-retirement plan contributions, and
    a $40 million increase in unearned/deferred revenue due to
    additional sales activity in the 2010 period.

Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased
    $208.4 million from 2008, primarily reflecting lower
    earnings on reduced sales from continuing operations and
    increased contributions to employee benefit plans, partially
    offset by improvements in working capital.

Postretirement costs relating to pension and other
    employee-related defined benefit plans affect results in all
    segments. The Company recorded net periodic benefit cost of
    $33 million, $37 million and $36 million in 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, relating to its benefit plans
    (including its defined benefit, supplemental and post-retirement
    plans). As further described in Note 13, the main drivers
    of the expense variance from year to year are the expected
    returns on plan assets, the service cost and the interest cost.
    In 2010, the actual return on plan assets increased, consistent
    with increased returns within the global equity markets. In
    2011, the Company expects its net



periodic benefit cost to be approximately $36 million, with
    the increase compared to 2010 being attributed to higher
    amortization relating to unrecognized losses.

The funded status of the Company’s qualified defined
    benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including
    returns on invested assets and the level of market interest
    rates. The Company contributes cash to its plans at its
    discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum
    contribution requirements. Cash contributions to qualified
    defined benefit pension plans in 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled
    $38 million, $51 million and $35 million,
    respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion regarding the Company’s
    post-retirement plans.

At December 31, 2010, the Company’s qualified defined
    benefit plans were underfunded by $49 million, which
    includes $7 million relating to the U.S. Dover
    Corporate Pension Plan and $42 million relating to the
    Company’s significant international pension plans, some in
    locations where it is not economically advantageous to pre-fund
    the plans due to local regulations. The majority of the
    international obligations relate to defined pension plans
    operated by the Company’s businesses in Germany, the United
    Kingdom and Switzerland. In 2011, the Company expects to
    contribute approximately $40 million to its qualified
    defined benefit plans.

Investing
    Activities

Cash used in investing activities during 2010 decreased
    $78.9 million compared to 2009, largely due to lower
    spending on acquisitions in 2010, offset in part by higher net
    proceeds from the sale of short-term investments and higher
    capital investments.

Cash used in investing activities during 2009 decreased
    $195.1 million compared to 2008, largely reflecting reduced
    capital expenditures and higher net proceeds from the sale of
    short-term investments, partially offset by higher acquisition
    investments and reduced proceeds from the sale of businesses.

Cash consideration paid for acquisitions was $104 million
    in 2010 compared to $222 million in 2009 and
    $104 million in 2008. In addition, during the fourth
    quarter of 2010, the Company signed a definitive agreement to
    acquire the Sound Solutions business of NXP Semiconductors.
    Sound Solutions, which is currently headquartered in Vienna,
    Austria, is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of
    dynamic speakers and receivers for the global cell phone market
    and will become part of Knowles Electronics, which is an
    operating unit of Dover’s Electronic Technologies segment.
    The purchase price is $855 million, subject to customary
    regulatory approvals, and the deal is expected to close around
    the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter of
    2011. This acquisition is expected to be entirely funded by cash
    and equivalents currently held outside the U.S.

Effective January 3, 2011, the Company also completed the
    acquisition of Harbison-Fischer, Inc., a Texas-based leading
    designer and manufacturer of down-hole rod pumps and related
    products for $402.5 million, subject to normal closing
    adjustments. Harbison-Fischer’s 2011 revenue is expected to
    be approximately $160 million. The business will become
    part of Norris Production Solutions, which is an operating unit
    of Dover’s Fluid Management segment.

The Company currently anticipates that these and any other
    acquisitions made during 2011 will be funded from available cash
    and internally generated funds, and if necessary, through the
    issuance of commercial paper or through public debt markets.

Cash used for capital expenditures increased to
    $183 million in 2010, compared to $120 million in 2009
    and $176 million in 2008, with the increase driven by
    capacity expansion requirements of the Company’s
    high-growth businesses. Additionally, 2009 capital spending was
    at reduced levels due to management’s spending discretion
    in response to the weakened economic environment.

Capital expenditures during 2011 are expected to be
    approximately 3.0% to 3.2% of revenue, which compares to 2010
    capital expenditures as a percent of revenue of 2.6%. The
    increase continues to be driven by capacity expansion in
    high-growth areas, including significant investment to support
    increased demand in the energy and cell phone markets.



Financing
    Activities

Cash used in financing activities during 2010 decreased
    $85.2 million compared to 2009, due mainly to lower debt
    repayments in 2010 and cash inflows from exercise of stock
    options, offset by share repurchases made in 2010. In 2010, the
    Company’s net repayments of debt and commercial paper were
    $166 million lower than in 2009. Proceeds from the exercise
    of stock options increased by $53 million in 2010 compared
    to 2009 due to the increased exercise of stock options.

Cash used in financing activities during 2009 decreased
    $171.0 million compared to 2008 primarily driven by the
    absence of share repurchases versus the prior year and reduced
    proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by
    debt repayments and higher dividend payments in 2009.

During 2010, financing cash outflows included repurchase of
    approximately 2.3 million shares of its common stock in the
    open market for approximately $124 million, pursuant to the
    10,000,000 share repurchase program authorized by the Board
    of Directors in May 2007. The Company had no share repurchases
    in 2009. Approximately 6.6 million shares remain authorized
    for repurchase under this 10,000,000 five year authorization as
    of December 31, 2010. In 2008, pursuant to a separate
    $500 million share repurchase program approved by the Board
    of Directors in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company
    repurchased 10,000,000 shares of its common stock in the
    open market for $467 million. The Company has completed the
    purchase of all shares under this $500 million share
    repurchase program.

In 2010, the Company paid quarterly dividends totaling $1.07 per
    share for the year, for a total of $200 million and a 5%
    increase over 2009 payments. In 2009 and 2008, $190 million
    and $169 million, respectively, was paid to shareholders.

Adjusted
    Working Capital

In 2010, Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated
    as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable)
    increased from 2009 by $240 million, or 22%, to
    $1.3 billion, which reflected an increase in receivables of
    $209 million, an increase in net inventory of
    $143 million and an increase in accounts payable of
    $112 million, generally due to additional working capital
    investment necessary to support the increased revenue levels.
    Excluding acquisitions, dispositions, and the effects of foreign
    exchange translation of $14 million, Adjusted Working
    Capital would have increased by $226 million, or 21%.
    “Average Annual Adjusted Working Capital” as a
    percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure calculated as the
    five-quarter average balance of accounts receivable, plus
    inventory, less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve
    months of revenue) decreased to 17.6% at December 31, 2010
    from 19.9% at December 31, 2009, and inventory turns were
    6.7 at December 31, 2010 compared to 6.2 at
    December 31, 2009.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately
    $66.0 million outstanding in letters of credit with
    financial institutions, which expire at various dates in 2011
    through 2015. These letters of credit are primarily maintained
    as security for insurance, warranty and other performance
    obligations. In general, the Company would only be liable for
    the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the
    performance of its obligations, the probability of which is
    remote in management’s opinion.

The Company has also provided typical indemnities in connection
    with sales of certain businesses and assets, including
    representations and warranties and related indemnities for
    environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters.
    The Company does not have liabilities recorded for certain of
    the historic indemnifications and is not aware of any claims or
    other information that would give rise to material payments
    under such indemnities.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The Company’s consolidated financial statements and related
    public financial information are based on the application of
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates,
    assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of
    accounting principles that have an impact on the assets,
    liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These
    estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in
    the public disclosures of the Company, including information
    regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The
    significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 1.
    The accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the
    section below are those that management considers most critical
    to an understanding of the Company’s financial statements
    because they inherently involve significant judgments and
    estimates. The Company believes its use of estimates and
    underlying accounting assumptions conform to GAAP and are
    consistently applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed
    for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the Company.

•

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances
    are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, b) price is fixed or determinable,
    c) collectability is reasonably assured, and
    d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where
    installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the
    installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of
    the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving
    non-essential installation obligations are those which can
    generally be completed in a short period of time at
    insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these
    installations are not unique to the



Company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or
    the customers. If the installation obligation is essential to
    the functionality of the delivered product, then revenue
    recognition is deferred until installation is complete. In
    addition, when it is determined that there are multiple
    deliverables to a sales arrangement, the Company will allocate
    consideration received to the separate deliverables based on
    their relative fair values and recognize revenue based on the
    appropriate criteria for each deliverable identified. In a
    limited number of revenue transactions, other post shipment
    obligations such as training and customer acceptance are
    required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is deferred until
    the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance has been
    confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned when
    services are performed. Revenues associated with
    construction-type contracts are recorded using the

percentage-of-completion

method. The Company recognizes contract revenue under

percentage-of-completion

accounting using the cost to cost method measure of progress.
    The application of percentage of completion accounting requires
    estimates of future revenues and contract costs over the full
    term of the contract. The Company updates project cost estimates
    on a quarterly basis or more frequently when changes in
    circumstances warrant.

•

Inventory for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries,
    including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the
    lower of cost, determined on the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is
    stated at cost, determined on the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under
    certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the
    valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly
    value inventory. The Electronic Technologies companies tend to
    experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value
    fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of
    product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time.

•

Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves
    at an operation, in accordance with appropriate accounting
    principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs,
    require the use of estimates. Though the Company believes that
    these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual
    results may be different than the estimated amounts.

•

The Company has significant tangible and intangible assets on
    its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles
    related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of
    these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and
    amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of
    estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established
    accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant
    use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to
    the identification of reporting units and the determination of
    fair market value. The Company’s assets and reporting units
    are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during
    the fourth quarter or, when indicators of impairment exist, such
    as a significant sustained change in the business climate,
    during the interim periods. The Company estimates fair value
    using discounted cash flow analyses (i.e. an income approach)
    which incorporate management assumptions relating to future
    growth and profitability. Changes in business or market
    conditions could impact the future cash flows used in such
    analyses. The Company believes that its use of estimates and
    assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted
    accounting principles. No goodwill impairment was indicated by
    the Company’s testing of its 10 identified reporting units
    in the fourth quarter of 2010, and the fair values of the
    reporting units significantly exceeded the carrying values. If
    the fair value of each of the reporting units was decreased by
    10%, the resulting fair value would still have exceeded the
    carrying value and no impairment would have been recognized.

•

The valuation of the Company’s pension and other
    post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and
    estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of
    expenses and assets/liabilities. Inherent in these valuations
    are key assumptions, including discount rates, investment
    returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality
    rates. The actuarial assumptions used in the Company’s
    pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with
    external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for
    the Company’s future pension obligations. Changes in
    assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have
    a material impact on the Company’s pension expenses and
    related funding requirements. The Company’s expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually
    based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio
    allocation. The Company’s discount rate assumption is
    determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality
    corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’
    expected benefit payment streams. The plans’ expected cash
    flows are then discounted by the resulting

year-by-year



spot rates. As disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, the Company’s 2010 weighted-average
    discount rates used to measure its qualified defined benefit,
    supplemental and other post-retirement obligations were 5.37%,
    5.50% and 5.10%, respectively, in each case reduced from the
    2009 rates of 5.71%, 5.95% and 5.50%, respectively. The reduced
    discount rates are reflective of the decline in global market
    interests over these periods. A 25 basis point decrease in
    the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the
    post retirement benefit obligations by approximately
    $26.7 million from the amount recorded in the financial
    statements at December 31, 2010. The Company’s pension
    expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets. A decrease of 25 basis
    points in the expected long-term rate of return on assets would
    have increased the Company’s defined benefit pension
    expense by approximately $1.3 million.

•

The Company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that
    are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These
    assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income
    streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are
    also estimated, using more likely than not criteria, for ongoing
    audits regarding federal, state and international issues that
    are currently unresolved. The Company routinely monitors the
    potential impact of these situations and believes that it is
    properly reserved. Reserves related to tax accruals and
    valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by
    changes in accounting regulations, changes in tax codes and
    rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and the Company’s
    future taxable income levels. The provision for uncertain tax
    positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement
    attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements
    regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The tax
    position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is
    greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon
    ultimate settlement. The Company records interest and penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its
    provision for income taxes.

•

The Company has significant accruals and reserves related to the
    self-insured portion of its risk management program. These
    accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard
    to risk exposure and ultimate liability. The Company estimates
    losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, the
    Company’s experience and relevant industry data. The
    Company reviews these factors quarterly and considers the
    current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to
    current market conditions and Company experience.

•

The Company has established reserves for environmental and legal
    contingencies at both the operating company and corporate
    levels. A significant amount of judgment and the use of
    estimates is required to quantify the Company’s ultimate
    exposure in these matters. The valuation of reserves for
    contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating
    and corporate levels to ensure that the Company is properly
    reserved. Reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes
    in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of
    additional reserves for emerging issues. While the Company
    believes that the current level of reserves is adequate, future
    changes in circumstances could impact these determinations.

•

The Company from time to time will discontinue certain
    operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if
    necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations
    to their estimated fair market value. These estimates include
    assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of
    the sale. Fair value is established using internal valuation
    calculations along with market analysis of similar-type
    entities. The adjustments to fair market value of these
    operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold.
    Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an
    operation could potentially require future adjustments to these
    estimates.

•

The Company is required to recognize in its consolidated
    statements of operations the expense associated with all
    share-based payment awards made to employees and directors,
    including stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs),
    restricted stock and performance share awards. The Company uses
    the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of
    its SARs, and stock options that are granted to employees. The
    model requires management to estimate the expected life of the
    SAR or option, expected forfeitures and the volatility of the
    Company’s stock using historical data. The Company uses the
    Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of
    performance share awards which also requires management



to estimate the volatility of its stock and the volatility of
    returns on the stock of its peer group as well as the
    correlation of the returns between the companies in the peer
    group. For additional information related to the assumptions
    used, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

New
    Accounting Standards

In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
    (“ASU”)

2010-06

which is intended to improve disclosures about fair value
    measurements. The guidance requires entities to disclose
    significant transfers in and out of fair value hierarchy levels,
    the reasons for the transfers and to present information about
    purchases, sales, issuances and settlements separately in the
    reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant
    unobservable inputs (Level 3). Additionally, the guidance
    clarifies that a reporting entity should provide fair value
    measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and
    disclose the inputs and valuation techniques used for fair value
    measurements using significant other observable inputs
    (Level 2) and significant unobservable inputs
    (Level 3). The Company has applied the new disclosure
    requirements as of January 1, 2010, except for the
    disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in
    the Level 3 reconciliation, which will be effective for
    interim and annual periods beginning after December 15,
    2010. The adoption of this guidance has not had and is not
    expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

2009-13

which amends existing guidance for identifying separate
    deliverables in a revenue-generating transaction where multiple
    deliverables exist, and provides guidance for allocating and
    recognizing revenue based on those separate deliverables. The
    guidance is expected to result in more multiple-deliverable
    arrangements being separable than under current guidance. This
    guidance is effective for the Company beginning on
    January 1, 2011 and is required to be applied prospectively
    to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements. Its
    adoption is not expected to significantly impact the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

2009-14

which eliminates tangible products containing both software and
    non-software components that operate together to deliver a
    product’s functionality from the scope of current generally
    accepted accounting principles for software. This guidance is
    effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2011 and
    is required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly
    modified revenue arrangements. Its adoption is not expected to
    significantly impact the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information
    regarding the Company’s results as determined by generally
    accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company also
    discloses non-GAAP information which management believes
    provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net
    debt, the net debt to net capitalization ratio, total debt,
    total capitalization, adjusted working capital, average annual
    adjusted working capital, revenues excluding the impact of
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue
    growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be
    considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating
    activities, debt or equity, revenue and working capital as
    determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be
    comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
    companies. Management believes the (1) net debt to net
    capitalization ratio and (2) free cash flow are important
    measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to net
    capitalization is helpful in evaluating the Company’s
    capital structure and the amount of leverage it employs. Free
    cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement
    of cash generated from operations that is available to fund
    acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase the
    Company’s common stock. Reconciliations of free cash flow,
    total debt and net debt can be found above in this Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operation. Management believes that reporting
    adjusted working capital (also sometimes called “working
    capital”), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus
    inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure
    of the Company’s operational results by showing the changes
    caused solely by revenue. Management believes that reporting
    adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency,
    which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful
    measure of the Company’s operational changes, given the
    global nature of Dover’s businesses. Management believes
    that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact
    of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of
    acquisitions, provides a useful comparison of the Company’s
    revenue performance and trends between periods.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The diverse nature of the Company’s business activities
    necessitates the management of various financial and market
    risks, including those related to changes in interest rates,
    foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The
    Company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to
    manage some of these risks. The Company does not hold or issue
    derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The
    Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance
    by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by
    the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is
    considered unlikely as the Company’s policy is to contract
    with highly-rated, diversified counterparties.

Interest
    Rate Exposure

The Company may from time to time enter into interest rate swap
    agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. As
    of December 31, 2010, the Company did not have any open
    interest rate swap contracts. The Company issues commercial
    paper, which exposes it to changes in variable interest rates;
    however, maturities are typically three months or less so a
    change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact
    on the Company’s pre-tax earnings.

The Company considers its current risk related to market
    fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since its debt is
    largely long-term and fixed-rate in nature. Generally, the fair
    market value of fixed-interest rate debt will increase as
    interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A
    100 basis point increase in market interest rates would
    decrease the fair value of Company’s long-term debt by
    approximately $130 million. However, since the Company has
    no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments
    before their maturities, the impact of market interest rate
    fluctuations on the Company’s long-term debt does not
    affect the Company’s results of operations or financial
    position.

Foreign
    Currency Exposure

The Company conducts business in various

non-U.S. countries,

primarily in Canada, Mexico, substantially all of the European
    countries, Brazil, Argentina, Malaysia, China, India and other
    Asian countries. Therefore, the Company has a significant volume
    of foreign currency exposures that result from its international
    sales, purchases, investments, borrowings and other
    international transactions. Changes in the value of the
    currencies of these countries affect the Company’s
    financial position and cash flows when translated into
    U.S. dollars.

The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate
    movements relative to its investment in

non-U.S. operations.

The Company may, from time to time, for a specific exposure,
    enter into fair value hedges. At December 31, 2010, the
    Company had one outstanding

floating-to-floating

cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of
    $50 million in exchange for CHF 65.1 million, which
    matures on February 15, 2011. This transaction hedges a
    portion of the Company’s net investment in

non-U.S. operations.

The agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in
    the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation
    adjustment section of other comprehensive income, with any hedge
    ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings. The fair
    values at December 31, 2010 reflected losses of
    $19.8 million and $13.3 million, due to the
    strengthening of the Swiss franc relative to the
    U.S. dollar over the term of this arrangement.

Certain individual operating companies that have foreign
    exchange exposure have established formal policies to mitigate
    risk in this area by using fair value

and/or

cash
    flow hedging programs. The Company has mitigated and will
    continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through
    operation of

non-U.S. operating

companies in which the majority of all costs are local-currency
    based. A change of 5% or less in the value of all foreign
    currencies would not have a material effect on the translation
    of the Company’s balance sheet or statement of operations.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

.

Based on its assessment under the criteria set forth in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

,
    management concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP.

In making its assessment of internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, management has excluded
    those companies acquired in purchase business combinations
    during 2010, which included BSC Filters, Chemilizer, Intek
    Manufacturing, the Diagnostic Product Line of Dynalco Controls,
    Gear Products, and

KMC/Bearings

Inc. These companies are wholly-owned by the Company and their
    total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010
    represents approximately 0.3% of the Company’s consolidated
    total revenue for the same period and their assets represent
    approximately 1.3% of the Company’s consolidated assets as
    of December 31, 2010.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report
    which appears herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Dover Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of Dover Corporation and its subsidiaries
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in “Management’s Report
    on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” appearing
    under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
    these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule,
    and on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
    audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
    material misstatement and whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



As described in “Management’s Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting,” management has excluded
    BSC Filters, Chemilizer, Intek Manufacturing, the Diagnostic
    Product Line of Dynalco Controls, Gear Products, and
    KMC/Bearings Inc. from its assessment of internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 because they
    were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations
    during 2010. We have also excluded BSC Filters, Chemilizer,
    Intek Manufacturing, the Diagnostic Product Line of Dynalco
    Controls, Gear Products, and KMC/Bearings Inc. from our audit of
    internal control over financial reporting. These subsidiaries
    are wholly owned by the Company and their total assets and
    revenue represent approximately 1.3% and 0.3%, respectively, of
    the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and
    for the year ended December 31, 2010.

    indicated)

1.

Description
    of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Description of Business

—  Dover
    Corporation (the “Company”) is a diversified,
    multinational manufacturing corporation comprised of operating
    companies that manufacture a broad range of specialized products
    and components as well as related services and consumables. The
    Company also provides engineering, testing and other similar
    services, which are not significant in relation to consolidated
    revenue. The Company’s operating companies are based
    primarily in the United States of America and Europe with
    manufacturing and other operations throughout the world. The
    Company reports its results in four segments, Industrial
    Products, Engineered Systems, Fluid Management and Electronic
    Technologies. For additional information on the Company’s
    segments, see Note 14.

Principles of Consolidation

— The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
    Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts
    and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The
    results of operations of purchased businesses are included from
    the dates of acquisitions. The assets, liabilities, results of
    operations and cash flows of all discontinued operations have
    been separately reported as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates
    may be adjusted due to changes in future economic, industry or
    customer financial conditions, as well as changes in technology
    or demand. Significant estimates include allowances for doubtful
    accounts receivable, net realizable value of inventories,
    restructuring reserves, valuation of goodwill and intangible
    assets, pension and post retirement assumptions, useful lives
    associated with amortization and depreciation of intangibles and
    fixed assets, warranty reserves, income taxes and tax valuation
    reserves, environmental reserves, legal reserves, insurance
    reserves and the valuations of discontinued assets and
    liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
    Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the
    effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial
    statements in the period that they are determined.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash and
    cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and
    short-term investments which are highly liquid in nature and
    have original maturities at the time of purchase of three months
    or less.

Short-Term Investments

— Short-term
    investments consist of investment grade time deposits that have
    original maturity dates at the time of purchase greater than
    three months, up to twelve months. The Company’s short-term
    investments earned interest at the weighted average rate of
    1.04% and 1.01%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

— The
    Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
    losses as a result of customer’s inability to make required
    payments. Management at each operating company evaluates the
    aging of the accounts receivable balances, the financial
    condition of its customers, historical trends and the time
    outstanding of specific balances to estimate the amount of
    accounts receivable that may not be collected in the future and
    records the appropriate provision.

Inventories

— Inventories for the
    majority of the Company’s subsidiaries, including all
    international subsidiaries, are stated at the lower of cost,
    determined on the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is
    stated at cost, determined on the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value.

Property, Plant and Equipment

—
    Property, plant and equipment includes the historic cost of
    land, buildings, equipment and significant improvements to
    existing plant and equipment or, in the case of acquisitions, a
    fair market value appraisal of such assets completed at the time
    of acquisition. Property, plant and equipment also includes the
    cost of purchased software. Expenditures for maintenance,
    repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When
    property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the
    related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the
    respective accounts and the gain or loss realized on disposition
    is reflected in earnings. Depreciation expense was $163,915 in
    2010, $159,595 in 2009 and $159,282 in 2008 and was calculated
    on a straight-line basis for all periods presented. The Company
    depreciates its assets over their estimated



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts
    in thousands except share data and where otherwise
    indicated)

useful lives as follows: buildings and improvements 5 to
    31.5 years; machinery and equipment 3 to 7 years;
    furniture and fixtures 3 to 7 years; vehicles 3 years;
    and software 3 to 5 years.

Derivative Instruments

— The Company
    periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its
    exposures to various risks, including interest rate and foreign
    currency exchange rate risk. The Company does not enter into
    derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and
    does not have a material portfolio of derivative financial
    instruments. Derivative financial instruments used for hedging
    purposes must be designated and effective as a hedge of the
    identified risk exposure at inception of the contract.

The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or
    liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and measures those
    instruments at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges
    of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair
    value of both the derivatives and of the hedged items are
    recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash
    flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value
    of the derivatives is recorded as a component of other
    comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings
    when the hedged items impact earnings.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible
    Assets

— Goodwill represents the excess of
    acquisition costs over the fair value of the net assets of
    businesses acquired. Goodwill and certain other intangible
    assets deemed to have indefinite lives (primarily trademarks)
    are not amortized. Instead, goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually,
    or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as a
    significant sustained change in the business climate. The
    Company conducts its annual impairment evaluation in the fourth
    quarter of each year. No impairment was indicated for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.

Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit
    level and determined using a two step process. For both 2010 and
    2009, the Company identified 10 reporting units for its annual
    goodwill impairment test. Step one of the test compared the fair
    value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method
    to its book value. This method uses the Company’s own
    market assumptions including projections of future cash flows,
    determinations of appropriate discount rates, and other
    assumptions which are considered reasonable and inherent in the
    discounted cash flow analysis. The projections are based on
    historical performance and future estimated results. These
    assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may
    differ from assumed and estimated amounts. Step two, which
    compares the book value of the goodwill to its implied fair
    value, was not necessary since there were no indicators of
    potential impairment from step one. See Note 6 for
    additional details on goodwill balances.

Similar to goodwill, in testing its other indefinite lived
    intangible assets for impairment, the Company uses a discounted
    cash flow method to calculate and compare the fair value of the
    intangible asset to its book value. This method uses the
    Company’s own market assumptions which are considered
    reasonable and inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis.
    Any excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value is
    recognized as an impairment loss.

Other Intangible Assets

— Other
    intangible assets with determinable lives consist primarily of
    customer lists, unpatented technology, patents and trademarks.
    These other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated
    useful lives, ranging from 5 to 15 years.

Long-Lived Assets

— Long-lived assets
    (including intangible assets with determinable lives) are
    reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable, such as a significant sustained change in
    the business climate. If an indicator of impairment exists for
    any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash
    flows is produced and compared to its carrying value. If an
    asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the
    excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value
    as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.
    There were no indicators of impairment noted during 2010.

Foreign Currency

— Assets and
    liabilities of

non-U.S. subsidiaries,

where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have
    been translated at year-end exchange rates and profit and loss
    accounts have been translated using



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts
    in thousands except share data and where otherwise
    indicated)

weighted average yearly exchange rates. Foreign currency
    translation gains and losses are included as a component of
    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Assets and
    liabilities of an entity that are denominated in currencies
    other than an entity’s functional currency are remeasured
    into the functional currency using end of period exchange rates
    or historical rates where applicable to certain balances. Gains
    and losses related to these remeasurements are recorded within
    the Statement of Operations as a component of Other Expense
    (Income), net.

Revenue Recognition

— Revenue is
    recognized when all of the following circumstances are
    satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability
    is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred. In
    revenue transactions where installation is required, revenue can
    be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential
    to the functionality of the delivered products. Revenue
    transactions involving non-essential installation obligations
    are those which can generally be completed in a short period of
    time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete
    these installations are not unique to the Company and in many
    cases can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the
    installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the
    delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until
    installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined
    that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the
    Company will allocate consideration received to the separate
    deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize
    revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable
    identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other
    post-shipment obligations such as training and customer
    acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is
    deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance
    has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned
    when services are performed and is not significant to any period
    presented. The Company recognizes contract revenue under
    percentage-of- completion accounting using the cost to cost
    method as the measure of progress. The application of

percentage-of-completion

accounting requires estimates of future revenues and contract
    costs over the full term of the contract. The Company updates
    project cost estimates on a quarterly basis or more frequently,
    when changes in circumstances warrant.

Stock-Based Compensation

— The principal
    awards issued under the Company’s stock-based compensation
    plans include non-qualified stock-settled stock appreciation
    rights and performance share awards. The cost for such awards is
    measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award.
    The value of the portion of the award that is expected to
    ultimately vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line
    basis, generally over the explicit service period of three years
    (except for retirement- eligible employees and retirees) and is
    included in selling and administrative expense in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. Awards granted to
    retirement-eligible employees are expensed immediately and the
    Company shortens the vesting period, for expensing purposes, for
    any employee who will become eligible to retire within the
    three-year explicit service period. Expense for these employees
    is recorded over the period from the date of grant through the
    date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no
    longer required to provide service. See Note 10 for
    additional information related to the Company’s stock-based
    compensation. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the
    time of grant in order to estimate the portion of the award that
    will ultimately vest. The estimate is based on the
    Company’s historical rates of forfeiture.

Income Taxes

— The provision for income
    taxes on continuing operations includes federal, state, local
    and

non-U.S. taxes.

Tax credits, primarily for research and experimentation and

non-U.S. earnings,

export programs, and U.S. manufacturer’s tax deduction
    are recognized as a reduction of the provision for income taxes
    on continuing operations in the year in which they are available
    for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are provided on temporary
    differences between assets and liabilities for financial and tax
    reporting purposes as measured by enacted tax rates expected to
    apply when temporary differences are settled or realized. Future
    tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of
    those benefits is considered to be more likely than not. A
    valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for
    which realization is not assured. The Company has not provided
    for any residual U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings
    of

non-U.S. subsidiaries

as such earnings are currently intended to be indefinitely
    reinvested.

Research and Development Costs

—
    Research and development costs, including qualifying engineering
    costs, are expensed when incurred and amounted to $193,487 in

Risk, Retention, Insurance

— The Company
    currently self-insures its product and commercial general
    liability claims up to $5.0 million per occurrence, its
    workers’ compensation claims up to $0.5 million per
    occurrence, and automobile liability claims up to
    $1.0 million per occurrence. Third-party insurance provides
    primary level coverage in excess of these amounts up to certain
    specified limits. In addition, the Company has excess liability
    insurance from third-party insurers on both an aggregate and an
    individual occurrence basis well in excess of the limits of the
    primary coverage. A worldwide program of property insurance
    covers the Company’s owned and leased property and any
    business interruptions that may occur due to an insured hazard
    affecting those properties, subject to reasonable deductibles
    and aggregate limits. The Company’s property and casualty
    insurance programs contain various deductibles that, based on
    the Company’s experience, are typical and customary for a
    company of its size and risk profile. The Company does not
    consider any of the deductibles to represent a material risk to
    the Company. The Company generally maintains deductibles for
    claims and liabilities related primarily to workers’
    compensation, health and welfare claims, general commercial,
    product and automobile liability and property damage, and
    business interruption resulting from certain events. The Company
    accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and
    can be reasonably estimated. As part of the Company’s risk
    management program, insurance is maintained to transfer risk
    beyond the level of self-retention and provide protection on
    both an individual claim and annual aggregate basis.

Reclassifications

— Certain amounts in
    prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current
    year presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

— In
    January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
    (“ASU”)

2010-06

which is intended to improve disclosures about fair value
    measurements. The guidance requires entities to disclose
    significant transfers in and out of fair value hierarchy levels,
    the reasons for the transfers and to present information about
    purchases, sales, issuances and settlements separately in the
    reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant
    unobservable inputs (Level 3).

Additionally,
    the guidance clarifies that a reporting entity should provide
    fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities
    and disclose the inputs and valuation techniques used for fair
    value measurements using significant other observable inputs
    (Level 2) and significant unobservable inputs
    (Level 3). The Company has applied the new disclosure
    requirements as of January 1, 2010, except for the
    disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in
    the Level 3 reconciliation, which will be effective for
    interim and annual periods beginning after December 15,
    2010. The adoption of this guidance has not had and is not
    expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

2009-13

which amends existing guidance for identifying separate
    deliverables in a revenue-generating transaction where multiple
    deliverables exist, and provides guidance for allocating and
    recognizing revenue based on those separate deliverables. The
    guidance is expected to result in more multiple-deliverable
    arrangements being separable than under current guidance. This
    guidance is effective for the Company beginning on
    January 1, 2011 and is required to be applied prospectively
    to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements. Its
    adoption is not expected to significantly impact the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

2009-14

which eliminates tangible products containing both software and
    non-software components that operate together to deliver a
    product’s functionality from the scope of current generally
    accepted accounting principles for software. This guidance is
    effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2011 and
    is required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly
    modified revenue arrangements. Its adoption is not expected to
    significantly impact the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Acquisitions

All of the Company’s 2010 and 2009 acquisitions were
    accounted for under Accounting Standard Codification
    (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (“ASC
    805”). Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the
    acquired businesses are accounted for under the purchase method
    of accounting and recorded at their fair values at the

dates of acquisition. The results of operations of acquired
    businesses have been included in the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition
    and were not material to the consolidated financial statements.
    In accordance with ASC 805, all direct transaction costs
    relating to the 2010 and 2009 acquisitions were expensed as
    incurred and such amounts were not material to the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company acquired 100% of each of these businesses in six
    separate transactions for an aggregate purchase price of
    $104,418, net of cash acquired. The Company makes an initial
    allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition
    based upon its understanding, obtained during due diligence and
    through other sources, of the fair value of the acquired assets
    and assumed liabilities. As additional information is obtained
    about these assets and liabilities within the measurement period
    (not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition), including
    through asset appraisals and learning more about the newly
    acquired business, the Company may refine its estimates of fair
    value to more accurately allocate the purchase price. The
    Company is still in the process of finalizing appraisals of
    tangible and intangible assets in order to complete its purchase
    price allocation for the KMC/Bearings Inc. acquisition which
    occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010. Accordingly, management
    has used its best estimates in the preliminary purchase price
    allocation as of the date of these financial statements.

(Amounts

Acquired intangible assets consist primarily of customer and
    technology-related intangibles and trademarks, which are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average
    amortization period of approximately 10 years (lives
    ranging from 7 to 12 years). The 2010 acquisitions resulted
    in the recognition of goodwill totaling $40,086, which is
    attributed primarily to the benefits derived from the
    complementary product line offerings and operational synergies
    the businesses bring to the existing operations.

Disposed
    and Discontinued Operations


— During the first quarter of 2010,
    the Company sold Triton, an operating company that had been
    reclassified from the Engineered Systems segment to discontinued
    operations in 2008, for net consideration of $7,498, resulting
    in a net after-tax current year loss on sale of approximately
    $13,100. During the second and third quarters of 2010, the loss
    was increased by approximately $900, net of tax, upon settlement
    of a $1,500 working capital adjustment related to the sale. The
    net loss from discontinued operations also includes tax benefits
    of $11,597 driven primarily by discrete tax items settled or
    resolved during the year, which more than offset other expense
    and accrual adjustments relating to discontinued operations
    during the year.


— During the first and fourth
    quarters of 2009, the Company recorded in aggregate, a $10,338
    (after-tax) additional write-down to the carrying value of
    Triton. The write-down and other adjustments related to
    previously discontinued entities resulted in a net after-tax
    loss on sale of $11,170 for the year. The after-tax loss from
    discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,
    2009 was $15,456.

(1)

Includes impairments and other adjustments to previously sold
    discontinued operations.


— During the second quarter of
    2008, the Company discontinued Triton and recorded an impairment
    charge of $51,173 (after-tax) to write-down the carrying value
    of Triton to its estimated fair market value. This write-down
    was increased by $21,330 (after-tax) in the fourth quarter based
    on factors supporting the fair value at that time. In the fourth
    quarter, the Company reached final settlement on certain Federal
    tax matters relating to businesses previously discontinued and
    sold, resulting in a charge of $14,602, after tax, and also
    recognized certain state tax adjustments relating to previously
    sold businesses resulting in a net charge of $12,736, after tax.
    The remaining adjustments comprising the 2008 after-tax loss on
    sale of $101,692 were individually insignificant and related to
    other businesses sold or held for sale during the period.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company also closed on a
    sale of a line of business in the Electronic Technologies
    segment resulting in a $7,518 (after-tax) gain, which was
    recorded in Selling and Administrative expenses in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company currently has no businesses held for sale in
    discontinued operations. At December, 31, 2010, the assets and
    liabilities of discontinued operations primarily represent
    residual amounts for deferred tax assets, short and long-term
    reserves, and contingencies related to businesses previously
    sold. Additional detail related to the assets and liabilities of
    the Company’s discontinued operations is as follows:

    January 1, 2009, the Company established reserves related
    to severance and facility closings in connection with certain
    acquisitions, which were established through the purchase
    accounting for these acquisitions, as allowed under accounting
    guidance in effect at the time. These reserves have been
    substantially settled in 2010.

In late 2008, the Company announced plans to substantially
    increase its restructuring efforts in response to the
    significant decline in global economic activity at the time. As
    a result, in 2009 the Company recorded restructuring charges
    totaling $72,102 for workforce reductions and facility
    rationalizations. The majority of these activities were carried
    out in 2009 and the exit reserves of $6,751 remaining at
    December 31, 2010 relate largely to lease commitment
    obligations in connection with these restructuring activities.
    Restructuring initiatives in 2010 were minor, and the Company
    does not anticipate significant restructuring charges in 2011.

The long-term note borrowings presented above are net of
    unamortized discounts of $5,764 and $6,240 in 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The debentures presented above include unamortized
    discounts of $4,572 and $4,767 in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    The discounts are being amortized to interest expense using the
    effective interest rate method over the life of the issuances.
    The notes and debentures are redeemable at the option of Dover
    in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price that
    includes a make-whole premium, with accrued interest to the
    redemption date.

At December 31, 2010, notes payable and current maturities
    of long-term debt shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
    includes commercial paper of $15,000. The weighted average
    interest rate for short-term commercial paper borrowings for
    2010 and 2009 was 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. The Company had
    no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December 31,
    2009.

The Company maintains a $1 billion unsecured revolving
    credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”), which
    expires on November 9, 2012. At the Company’s
    election, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at
    a Eurodollar or Sterling rate based on LIBOR, plus an applicable
    margin ranging from 0.13% to 0.35% (subject to adjustment based
    on the rating accorded the Company’s senior unsecured debt
    by S&P and Moody’s), or at a base rate pursuant to a
    formula defined in the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit
    Agreement requires the Company to pay a facility fee and a
    utilization fee in certain circumstances and imposes various
    restrictions on the Company such as, among other things, the
    requirement for the Company to maintain an interest coverage
    ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less
    than 3.5 to 1. The Company was in compliance with all of its
    debt covenants at December 31, 2010 and had a coverage
    ratio of 12.1 to 1. The Company primarily uses this facility as
    liquidity

back-up

for
    its commercial paper program and has not drawn down any loans
    under the $1 billion facility and does not anticipate doing
    so. The Company generally uses commercial paper borrowings for
    general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential
    acquisitions and the repurchases of its common stock.

During the third quarter of 2010, the lender of a structured
    five-year, non-interest bearing amortizing loan originally due
    July 2011 called the loan, as permitted per the terms of the
    agreement. As a result, the Company repaid the outstanding
    $51,214 balance and recognized a net loss on extinguishment of
    $4,343, recorded in other income.

Principal payments required on long-term debt for the next five
    years (2011 to 2015) and thereafter are $401,911 in 2011,
    $616 in 2012, $500 in 2013, $0 in 2014, $299,047 in 2015, and
    $1,090,737 thereafter. The

Company currently has debt with a carrying value of
    approximately $399,986 which matures February 15, 2011.
    This amount is classified as long-term within the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010 as the Company has the
    ability and intends to refinance this debt on a long-term basis.
    The Company anticipates refinancing this debt with a maturity
    date beyond five years; however, since the terms of the
    refinancing have not been finalized, the debt is reflected
    within the 2011 repayments in the aforementioned principal
    payments schedule.

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 was $115,490, $116,234 and $130,150, respectively.
    Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008 was $9,149, $15,859 and $34,113, respectively.

9.

Financial
    Instruments

Derivatives

The Company is exposed to market risk for changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates due to the global nature of its
    operations. In order to manage this risk the Company has hedged
    portions of its forecasted sales and purchases, which occur
    within the next twelve months and are denominated in
    non-functional currencies, with currency forward or collar
    contracts. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had
    contracts with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts of
    $63,935 and $45,847, respectively, to exchange foreign
    currencies, principally the U.S. dollar, British pound,
    Singapore dollar, Chinese yuan and Malaysian ringgit. The
    Company believes it is probable that all forecasted cash flow
    transactions will occur.

At December 31, 2010, the Company also had an outstanding

floating-to-floating

cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of
    $50,000 in exchange for CHF 65,100, which matures on
    February 15, 2011. This transaction hedges a portion of the
    Company’s net investment in

non-U.S. operations.

The agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in
    the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation
    adjustment section of other comprehensive income, with any hedge
    ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings. The fair
    values at December 31, 2010 and 2009 reflected losses of
    $19,774 and $13,278, respectively, due to the strengthening of
    the Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar over the term
    of this arrangement.

The following table sets forth the fair values of derivative
    instruments held by the Company as of December 31, 2010 and
    2009 and the balance sheet lines in which they are recorded:

The amount of gains or losses from hedging activity recorded in
    earnings is not significant and the amount of unrealized gains
    and losses from cash flow hedges which are expected to be
    reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months is not
    significant; therefore, additional tabular disclosures are not
    presented. There are no amounts excluded from the assessment of
    hedge effectiveness and there are no credit risk related
    contingent features in the Company’s derivative instruments.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument
    contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these
    counterparties is considered unlikely as the Company’s
    policy is to contract with highly-rated, diversified
    counterparties.

Fair
    Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

,
    establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the Company to
    maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
    unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial
    instrument’s categorization within the hierarchy is based
    on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
    value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of
    inputs that may be used to measure fair value.

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 inputs include inputs other than Level 1 that
    are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted
    prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities,
    quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
    markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable
    or can be corroborated by observable market data for
    substantially the full term of assets or liabilities.

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs in which little or
    no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop
    its own assumptions.

The following table presents the Company’s assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009:

Short-term investments consist of investment grade time deposits
    with original maturities between three months and one year and
    are included in current assets in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet. Short-term investments are measured at fair value using
    quoted market prices. The derivative contracts are measured at
    fair value using models based on observable market inputs such
    as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates;
    therefore, they are classified within Level 2 of the
    valuation hierarchy.

In addition to fair value disclosure requirements related to
    financial instruments carried at fair value, accounting
    standards require disclosures regarding the fair value of all of
    the Company’s financial instruments.

The Company’s long-term debt instruments with a book value
    of $1,792,811 had a fair value of approximately $1,961,697 at
    December 31, 2010. On December 31, 2009, the
    Company’s long-term debt instruments had a book value of
    $1,860,884 and a fair value of approximately $1,954,569. The
    estimated fair value of the long-term debt is based on quoted
    market prices for similar issues. The fair value of short-term
    loans, principally commercial paper at December 31, 2010,
    approximates carrying value.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade
    receivables, accounts payable, notes payable, and accrued
    expenses are reasonable estimates of their fair values as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 due to the short-term nature of
    these instruments.

Equity
    and Cash Incentive Program

    Equity and Cash Incentive Plan

On April 20, 2004, the shareholders approved the Dover
    Corporation 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2005
    Plan”) to replace the 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan and
    1995 Cash Performance Program (the “1995 Plan”), which
    expired on January 30, 2005. Under the 2005 Plan, a maximum
    aggregate of 20 million shares were reserved for grants
    (non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock settled stock
    appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, and
    performance share awards) to key personnel between
    February 1, 2005 and January 31, 2015, provided that
    no incentive stock options shall be granted under the plan after
    February 11, 2014 and a maximum of two million shares may
    be granted as restricted stock or performance share awards. The
    exercise price of options and SARs may not be less than the fair
    market value of the stock at the time the awards are granted.
    The period during which these options and SARs are exercisable
    is fixed by the Company’s Compensation Committee at the
    time of grant, but generally may not commence sooner than three
    years after the date of grant, and may not exceed ten years from
    the date of grant. All stock options or SARs issued under the
    1995 Plan or the 2005 Plan vest after three years of service and
    expire at the end of ten years. All stock options and SARs are
    granted at regularly scheduled quarterly Compensation Committee
    meetings (usually only at the meeting during the first quarter)
    and have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the
    Company’s stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date
    of grant. New common shares are issued when options or SARs are
    exercised.

Performance
    Share Awards

In May 2009, the shareholders of the Company approved an
    amendment to the 2005 Plan allowing the granting of performance
    share awards that will become payable in common shares upon
    achievement of pre-established performance targets. The changes
    to the 2005 Plan are detailed in the Company’s Proxy
    Statement dated March 24, 2009 under the heading
    “Proposal 2 — Proposal to Approve Amendments
    to the 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plans.” Performance
    share awards granted under the 2005 Plan are being expensed over
    the three year period that is the requisite performance and
    service period. Awards shall become vested if (1) the
    Company achieves certain specified stock performance targets
    compared to a peer group of 38 companies and (2) the
    employee remains continuously employed by the company during the
    performance period. Partial vesting may occur for certain
    terminations not for cause and for retirements. The Company
    assesses performance levels quarterly. Compensation expense
    relating to performance share awards for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $2,632 and $555,
    respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense as of
    December 31, 2010 is $3,038 which will be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 1.8 years.

The Company also has restricted stock authorized for grant (as
    part of the 2005 Plan), under which common stock of the Company
    may be granted at no cost to certain officers and key employees.
    In general, restrictions limit the sale or transfer of these
    shares during a two or three year period, and restrictions lapse
    proportionately over the two or three year period. The Company
    granted 15,500 restricted shares in 2010. No restricted shares
    were granted in 2009 or 2008.

The Company has a stock compensation plan under which
    non-employee directors are granted shares of the Company’s
    common stock each year as more than half of their compensation
    for serving as directors. During 2010, the Company issued an
    aggregate of 20,279 shares, of its common stock to 13
    outside directors (after withholding 574 additional shares to
    satisfy tax obligations) as partial compensation for serving as
    directors of the Company during 2010. During 2009, the Company
    issued an aggregate of 14,726 shares, of its common stock
    to 11 outside directors (after withholding 6,823 additional
    shares to satisfy tax obligations) as partial compensation for
    serving as directors of the Company during 2009. During 2008,
    the Company issued an aggregate of 29,213 shares, net, of
    its common stock to 12 outside directors (after withholding
    11,582 additional shares to satisfy tax obligations) as partial
    compensation for serving as directors of the Company during 2008.

as of December 31, 2010 of $1.2 million and
    $52.7 million, respectively, and as of December 31,
    2009, $8.4 million and $73.8 million, respectively.
    The federal loss carryforwards are available for use against the
    Company’s consolidated federal taxable income and expire in
    2029. The entire balance of the

non-U.S. losses

is available to be carried forward, with $8.5 million of
    these losses beginning to expire during the years 2012 through
    2030. The remaining $44.2 million of such losses can be
    carried forward indefinitely.

The Company has loss carryforwards for state purposes as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $211.8 million and
    $220.9 million, respectively. The state loss carryforwards
    are available for use by the Company between 2011 and 2030.

The Company has U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $24.5 million and
    $61.8 million, respectively. The U.S. foreign tax
    credit carryforwards are available for use by the Company
    between 2011 and 2019.

The Company has research and development credits of
    $3.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009 that are
    available for use by the Company between 2011 and 2026.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had available
    alternative minimum tax credits of $3.1 million, which are
    available for use by the Company indefinitely, and alternative
    minimum tax

non-U.S. tax

credits of $11.7 million that are available for use by the
    Company between 2011 and 2026.

The Company maintains valuation allowances by jurisdiction
    against the deferred tax assets related to certain of these
    carryforwards as utilization of these tax benefits is not
    assured for certain jurisdictions.

The Company has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes
    or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings of its
    international subsidiaries because such earnings are reinvested
    and it is currently intended that they will continue to be
    reinvested indefinitely. At December 31, 2010, the Company
    has not provided for federal income taxes on earnings of
    approximately $1.2 billion from its international
    subsidiaries.

Unrecognized
    Tax Benefits

The Company files federal income tax returns, as well as
    multiple state, local and

non-U.S. jurisdiction

tax returns. The Company is no longer subject to examinations of
    its federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”) for years through 2006. All significant state,
    local, and international matters have been concluded for years
    through 1993 and 2000, respectively. With the exception of
    contested matters, for which an estimate cannot be made due to
    uncertainties, the Company believes that additional uncertain
    tax positions will be settled in 2011.

    $46.5 million at December 31, 2009.

12.

Commitments
    and Contingent Liabilities

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal
    proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites
    identified under federal and state statutes that provide for the
    allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible
    parties.” In each instance, the extent of the
    Company’s liability appears to be very small in relation to
    the total projected expenditures and the number of other
    “potentially responsible parties” involved and is
    anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few
    of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing
    remedial activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with
    regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been
    established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to
    a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their
    businesses. These proceedings primarily involve claims by
    private parties alleging injury arising out of use of the
    Company’s products, exposure to hazardous substances or
    patent infringement, litigation and administrative proceedings
    involving employment matters and commercial disputes. Management
    and legal counsel periodically review the probable outcome of
    such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably expected to
    be incurred, the availability and extent of insurance coverage,
    and established reserves. While it is not possible at this time
    to predict the outcome of these legal actions or any need for
    additional reserves, in the opinion of management, based on
    these reviews, it is unlikely that the disposition of the
    lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, cash flows or competitive position of the Company.

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
    operating leases, many of which contain renewal options. Total
    rental expense, net of insignificant sublease rental income, for
    all operating leases was $75,172, $74,859 and $76,651 for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Contingent rentals under the operating leases were not
    significant.

The aggregate future minimum lease payments for operating and
    capital leases as of December 31, 2010 are as follows:

    $66,002 outstanding in letters of credit with financial
    institutions, which expire at various dates in 2011 through
    2015. These letters of credit are primarily maintained as
    security for insurance, warranty and other performance
    obligations.

13.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company offers a defined contribution plan to most of its
    employees. The Company also has defined benefit pension plans
    (the “plans”) covering certain employees of the
    Company and its subsidiaries. The plans’ benefits are
    generally based on years of service and employee compensation.
    The Company’s funding policy is consistent with the funding
    requirements of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act
    (“ERISA”) and applicable international laws.

The Company is responsible for overseeing the management of the
    investments of the plans’ assets and otherwise ensuring
    that the plans’ investment programs are in compliance with
    ERISA, other relevant legislation, and related plan documents.
    Where relevant, the Company has retained professional investment
    managers to manage the plans’ assets and implement the
    investment process. The investment managers, in implementing
    their investment processes, have the authority and
    responsibility to select appropriate investments in the asset
    classes specified by the terms of their applicable prospectus or
    investment manager agreements with the plans.

The primary financial objective of the plans is to secure
    participant retirement benefits. Accordingly, the key objective
    in the plans’ financial management is to promote stability
    and, to the extent appropriate, growth in the funded status.
    Related and supporting financial objectives are established in
    conjunction with a review of current and projected plan
    financial requirements.

The assets of the plans are invested to achieve an appropriate
    return for the plans consistent with a prudent level of risk.
    The asset return objective is to achieve, as a minimum over
    time, the passively managed return earned by market index funds,
    weighted in the proportions outlined by the asset class
    exposures identified in the plans’ strategic allocation.
    The expected return on assets assumption used for pension
    expense is developed through analysis of historical market
    returns, statistical analysis, current market conditions and the
    past experience of plan asset investments. Overall, it is
    projected that the investment of plan assets will achieve a
    7.75% net return over time from the asset allocation strategy.

The actual and target weighted-average asset allocation for
    defined benefit plans was as follows:

Common stocks represent investments in U.S. equities which
    are publicly traded on active exchanges and are valued based on
    quoted market prices.

Fixed income investments include U.S. treasury bonds and
    notes, which are valued based on quoted market prices, as well
    as investments in other U.S. government and municipal
    securities and corporate bonds, which are valued based on yields
    currently available on comparable securities of issuers with
    similar credit ratings.

Debt, equity and real estate funds represent commingled
    investment funds. The debt and equity fund investments are
    valued using Net Asset Value (“NAV”) which is based on
    the underlying value of the assets owned by the funds, minus
    liabilities, then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
    The NAV is a quoted price in an active market. The real estate
    funds are valued on an annual basis using third-party
    appraisals, with adjustments estimated on a quarterly basis
    using discounted cash flow models which consider such inputs as
    revenue and expense growth rates, terminal capitalization rates
    and discount rates.

The fair value measurement of plan assets using significant
    unobservable inputs (Level 3) changed during 2010 due
    to the following:

The Company’s discount rate assumption is determined by
    developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds
    with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit
    payment streams. The plans’ expected cash flows are then
    discounted by the resulting

year-by-year

spot rates.

The Company also provides, through non-qualified plans,
    supplemental retirement benefits in excess of qualified plan
    limits imposed by federal tax law. These plans are supported by
    the general assets of the Company.

The Company’s net unfunded status of $49,445 at
    December 31, 2010 includes $6,971 relating to the
    U.S. Dover Corporate Pension Plan and $42,474 relating to
    the Company’s significant international pension plans, some
    in locations where it is not economically advantageous to
    pre-fund the plans due to local regulations. The majority of the
    international obligations relate to defined pension plans
    operated by the Company’s businesses in Germany, the United
    Kingdom and Switzerland.

Pension cost for all defined contribution, defined benefit, and
    supplemental plans was $78,513 for 2010, $72,884 for 2009 and
    $81,693 for 2008.

For post-retirement benefit measurement purposes, an 8.0% annual
    rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits
    (i.e., health care cost trend rates) was assumed for 2011. The
    rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5% by the year 2017
    and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend
    rate assumption can have an effect on the amounts reported. For
    example, increasing (decreasing) the assumed health care cost
    trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase
    (decrease) the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as
    of December 31, 2010 by $397 ($380) and would have a
    negligible impact on the net post-retirement benefit cost for
    2010.

The post-retirement benefit plans cover approximately 1,634
    participants, approximately 778 of whom are eligible for medical
    benefits. The plans are effectively closed to new entrants. The
    post-retirement benefit

    approximately $3,529 and $4,767 in obligations, respectively,
    recorded in discontinued operations.

Revenue is attributed to regions based on the location of the
    Company’s customer, which in some instances is an
    intermediary and not necessarily the end user. Long-lived assets
    are comprised of net property, plant and equipment. The
    Company’s operating companies are based primarily in the
    United States of America and Europe. The Company’s
    businesses serve thousands of customers, none of which accounted
    for more than 10% of consolidated revenue. Accordingly, it is
    impractical to provide revenue from external customers for each
    product and service sold by segment.

15.

Shareholders’
    Equity

The Company has the authority to issue up to 100,000 shares
    of $100 par value preferred stock and up to
    500,000,000 shares of $1 par value common stock. None
    of the preferred stock has been issued. As of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, 249,373,529 and 247,343,411 shares of common
    stock were issued, respectively. In addition, the Company had
    62,885,348 and 60,467,393 shares in treasury, held at cost,
    as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Share
    Repurchases


During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    repurchased 2,335,500 shares of its common stock in the
    open market at an average price of $51.13 per share under the
    five-year, 10,000,000 share repurchase authorized

Subsequent
    Events

The Company assessed events occurring subsequent to
    December 31, 2010 for potential recognition and disclosure
    in the consolidated financial statements. No events have
    occurred that would require adjustment to the consolidated
    financial statements.

In December 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with NXP
    Semiconductors N.V. to acquire the Sound Solutions business line
    for approximately $855 million. The transaction is subject
    to customary regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of normal
    closing conditions, and is expected to close around the end of
    the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2011. Sound
    Solutions is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of
    dynamic speakers and receivers for cell phones and other
    consumer electronics, with annual unaudited 2010 revenue of
    approximately $330 million. The business will be
    incorporated into the Knowles business within the Dover
    Electronic Technologies segment, which will enhance the
    segment’s product offerings serving the high growth mobile
    handset market.

Effective January 3, 2011, the Company completed the
    acquisition of Harbison-Fischer, Inc., a Texas-based leading
    designer and manufacturer of down-hole rod pumps and related
    products for $402.5 million, subject to normal closing
    adjustments. Harbison-Fischer’s 2011 revenue is expected to
    be approximately $160 million. The business will become
    part of Norris Production Solutions, which is an operating unit
    of Dover’s Fluid Management segment.

Effective January 5, 2011, the Company completed the
    acquisition of Dosmatic, Inc., a Texas-based leading
    manufacturer of environmentally friendly, non-electric chemical
    metering equipment for approximately $14 million, subject
    to normal closing adjustments. The business will become part of
    Hydro Systems Company, which is also an operating unit of
    Dover’s Fluid Management segment.

Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31,
    2010 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
    Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
    Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and
    communicated to the Company’s management, including its
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
    appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

During the fourth quarter of 2010, there were no changes in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations Over Internal Controls

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that:

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that the Company’s receipts and
    expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of the Company’s management and
    directors; and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
    on the financial statements.

Management’s report on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the
    Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all
    errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
    are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
    the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
    of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
    of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance
    that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have
    been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those
    internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9B.
