Spin-off of Energy Businesses

On December 7, 2017, we announced that we plan to spin-off, on a tax-free basis, our upstream energy businesses within our Energy segment, collectively, the “Wellsite” business, into a standalone, publicly traded company, to be named at a later date.

Upon completion of the spin-off, Wellsite will be a leading provider of a full range of oil and gas production technologies and solutions, wellsite productivity software and Industrial Internet ("IIoT") solutions. Wellsite will also be the industry leader in the development and production of polycrystalline diamond cutters used for oil and gas exploration. Wellsite serves many of the most attractive segments in the oil and gas industry with its portfolio of leading brands including

Norris

,

Harbison-Fischer

,

Accelerated, PCS Ferguson, Norriseal-Wellmark, Spirit

,

Quartzdyne

,

Windrock

and

USS

. We expect to complete the spin-off of the Wellsite businesses in May of 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions.  Upon separation, the historical results of

Wellsite

will be presented as discontinued operations as it represents a strategic shift in operations with a material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



As part of the spin-off, Wellsite is expected to raise $700 million to $800 million of new debt, the proceeds of which will be paid to Dover in the form of a dividend. We anticipate returning the proceeds to shareholders as the primary source of funding for $1 billion of share repurchases to be completed by the end of 2018.

Management Philosophy

Our businesses are committed to operational excellence and to being market leaders as measured by market share, customer satisfaction, growth, profitability and return on invested capital. Our operating structure of four business segments allows for focused acquisition activity, accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies, including global sourcing and supply chain integration, shared services and manufacturing and advances the development of our executive talent. Our segment and executive management set strategic direction, initiatives and goals and provide oversight for our operating companies and also allocate and manage capital, are responsible for major acquisitions and provide other services. We foster an operating culture with high ethical standards, trust, respect and open communication, designed to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness.

In addition, we are committed to creating value for our customers, employees and shareholders through sustainable business practices that protect the environment and the development of products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals. We have accelerated our efforts and processes around innovation, focusing on technologies which create tangible value for our customers. Most notably, we believe that product innovations like the LaRio single-pass digital textile printer within our Engineered Systems segment, EvoClean laundry system within our Fluids segment, AdvansorFlex CO


refrigeration system and Vista Elite Cooler Door within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment and Spirit Genesis Pump Off Controller within our Energy segment help to make a positive difference for the environment while providing value to shareholders and customers.

Our operating companies are increasing their focus on efficient energy usage, greenhouse gas reduction and waste management as they strive to meet the global environmental needs of today and tomorrow.

Company Goals

We are committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives. First, we are committed to achieving annual organic sales growth of 3% to 5% over a long-term business cycle, absent adverse economic conditions, complemented by acquisition growth. Second, we continue to focus on segment margin expansion through productivity initiatives, including supply chain activities, targeted, thoughtful restructuring activities, strategic pricing and portfolio shaping. Third, we are committed to generating adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of sales of approximately 10% through strong earnings performance, productivity improvements and active working capital management. We support these goals through (1) alignment of management compensation with financial objectives, (2) well-defined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes and (3) talent development programs.

Business Strategy

To achieve our goals, we are focused on execution of the following three key business strategies:

Positioning ourselves for growth

We have aligned our business segments to focus on the needs of customers in key end markets that are well-positioned for future growth. We capitalize on our expertise while maintaining an intense focus on our customers and their needs. We maintain and emphasize our entrepreneurial culture and continuously innovate to address our customers’ needs to help them win in the markets they serve.

In particular, our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on trends in the areas of global energy demand, continuous productivity improvement, sustainability, energy efficiency, consumer product safety and growth of consumerism in emerging economies. Our Engineered Systems segment combines its engineering technology and capabilities, unique product advantages and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including conversion to digital textile printing, productivity solutions, sustainability, consumer product safety and growth in emerging economies. The Fluids segment is focused on accelerated growth within the chemical/plastics, retail fueling, fluid transfer, industrial and hygienic markets as well as globalizing brands across geographies while expanding sales channels and engineering support. In particular, we are pursuing further growth



in the retail fueling, hygienic and pharma and polymers/plastics markets. Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment is responding to our customers’ energy efficiency and sustainability concerns and unique merchandising requirements with innovative new products. Our Energy segment is focusing on expansion in high growth basins and technologies, accelerating capabilities to drive international growth and increasing investment in automation to drive customer productivity and cash flow.

Capturing the benefits of common ownership

We are committed to operational excellence and capturing the benefits of common ownership.  Through formalized company sponsored programs and an embedded culture of continuous improvement, we focus on adjusted free cash flow generation, productivity to support ongoing investment in product innovation and customer expansion activities, the continuous evaluation of operating efficiencies and the continued consolidation of back office support. Through these programs we have implemented various productivity initiatives, such as supply chain management and lean manufacturing, to maximize our efficiency as well as workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees. We foster the sharing of best practices throughout the organization. To ensure success, our businesses place strong emphasis on continual quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets. Further, we continue to make significant investments in talent development, recognizing that the growth and development of our employees are essential for our continued success.

Additionally in 2016, we began to invest in our Dover Business Services ("DBS") shared service centers which brings significant value to Dover by providing important transactional and value added services to our operating companies in the areas of finance, information technology and human resources. Our model allows us to leverage scale across Dover, increase process efficiencies through technology and specialization and reduce risk through centralized controls. Ultimately, our mission is to serve our operating companies by freeing resources normally dedicated to transactional services to allow those resources to focus on customers, markets and product excellence.

Disciplined capital allocation

Our businesses generate annual adjusted free cash flow of approximately 10% of revenue. We are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize returns on investment. To do this, we grow and support our existing businesses with average annual investment in capital spending of approximately 2% to 2.5% of revenue with a focus on internal projects to expand markets, develop products and boost productivity. Businesses in our portfolio are continually evaluated for strategic fit and our acquisitions are targeted in our key growth markets which include printing and identification, refrigeration and food equipment, pumps, fueling and transport, hygienic and pharma and select energy markets. We consistently return cash to shareholders by paying dividends, which have increased annually over each of the last 62 years. We will also plan to complete $1 billion of share repurchases by the end of 2018 as part of our capital allocation strategy.

Portfolio Development

Acquisitions

Our acquisition program has two key elements. First, we seek to acquire value creating add-on businesses that enhance our existing businesses either through their global reach and customers, or by broadening their product mix. Second, in the right circumstances, we will strategically pursue larger, stand-alone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces. With all our acquisitions, we seek businesses that have an accretive margin and a strong organic growth profile, and also offer significant synergy opportunities.



Over the past three years (


through


), we have spent over

$2.2 billion

to purchase


businesses. During


, we acquired

three

businesses for an aggregate consideration of

$43.1 million

, net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration. These businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within the Engineered Systems and Fluids segments. During 2016, we acquired

six

businesses for an aggregate purchase price of

$1.6 billion

, net of cash acquired. These businesses include Tokheim Group S.A.S., Fairbanks Environmental LTD, ProGauge and Wayne Fueling Systems Ltd. to expand our Fluids segment's retail fueling portfolio and Alliance Wireless Technologies, Inc. and Ravaglioli S.p.A. Group to complement the Industrials platform within our Engineered Systems segment. During 2015, we acquired

four

businesses for an aggregate purchase price of

$567.8 million

, net of cash acquired. These businesses include Gala Industries and Reduction Engineering Scheer, to expand our Fluids segment's plastics and polymers product and integrated systems portfolio. In addition, in 2015, we acquired JK Group, a global manufacturer and provider of innovative digital inks for the textile printing market, to complement the Printing & Identification platform within our Engineered Systems segment. For more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years, see

Note 3 — Acquisitions

in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses which expand the scope of our offering and make us a more important supplier to our customers. While we expect to generate annual organic growth of 3% to 5% over a long-term business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions, sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year. Our success is also dependent on the ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses within our existing structure. To track post-merger integration and accountability, we utilize an internal scorecard and defined processes to help ensure expected synergies are realized and value is created.

Dispositions

Occasionally, we may also make an opportunistic sale of one of our businesses based on specific market conditions or for strategic considerations, which include an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets and focus on our higher margin growth spaces. During the past three years (


through


) we have sold

seven

businesses for aggregate consideration of

$1.3 billion

.

During 2017, we completed the sale of Performance Motorsports International and the consumer and industrial winch business of Warn Industries, within the Engineered Systems segment, as well as other smaller divestitures. These disposals did not represent strategic shifts in operations and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.

During 2016, we completed the sale of Texas Hydraulics and Tipper Tie, within the Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments, respectively. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2015 we completed the divestiture of the walk-in cooler business of Hillphoenix within the Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment. These disposals did not represent strategic shifts in operations and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.

During 2015, we completed the sale of Datamax O'Neil and Sargent Aerospace. The financial position and results of operations for the 2015 divestitures have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. For more details, see

Note 4 — Disposed and Discontinued Operations

in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Business Segments

As noted previously, we currently operate through four business segments that are aligned with the key end markets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments: Engineered Systems, Fluids, Refrigeration & Food Equipment and Energy. For financial information about our segments and geographic areas, see

Note 17 — Segment Information

in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Our Energy segment’s sales are made directly to customers and through various distribution channels. We manufacture our products primarily in North America and our sales are concentrated in North America with an increasing level of international sales directed primarily to Europe, Australia and Asia.

Raw Materials

We use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished components, which are generally available from a number of sources. As a result, shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had, and are not likely to have, a material impact on operating profits. While the required raw materials are generally available, commodity pricing can be volatile, particularly for various grades of steel, copper, aluminum and select other commodities. Although cost increases in commodities may be recovered through increased prices to customers, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. We attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global supply chain activities.



Research and Development

Our businesses invest to develop innovative products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs, expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally, maintain or extend competitive advantages, improve product reliability and reduce production costs. During


, we spent

$125.0 million

for research and development, including qualified engineering costs. In


and


, research and development spending totaled

$104.5 million

and

$115.0 million

, respectively.

Our Engineered Systems segment expends significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high. Our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation, performance improvement and reduced costs. The result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period.

Our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives. These businesses concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes. Most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the Engineered Systems segment.

Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets

Our businesses own many patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over a number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various times over a number of years. A large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents, unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate. In addition, a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships. While our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success, the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships, or any group of related rights or relationships, is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis. We believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements, new product development and improved manufacturing techniques, as well as strong sales, marketing and service efforts, are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve.

Customers

We serve thousands of customers, none of which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in


. Given our diversity of served markets, customer concentrations are not significant. Businesses supplying the waste and recycling, agricultural, defense, energy, automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries. This also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation and chemical industries. In the other markets served, there is usually a much lower concentration of customers, particularly where our companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of end-use applications.

Seasonality

In general, our businesses, while not strongly seasonal, tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, particularly those serving the transportation, construction, waste and recycling, petroleum, commercial refrigeration and food service markets. Our businesses serving the retail fueling market tend to increase sequentially through the year based on the historical purchasing patterns of their customers. Our businesses serving the major equipment markets, such as power generation, chemical and processing industries, have longer lead times geared to seasonal, commercial, or consumer demands and customers in these markets tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends that tend to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns.

Backlog

Backlog is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have long-term contracts, primarily for the markets within our Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. Our total backlog relating to our continuing operations as of

December 31, 2017

and


was

$1.2 billion

and

$1.1 billion

, respectively.



Competition

Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served. In general, most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies, and the key competitive factors are customer service, product quality, price and innovation. However, as we become increasingly global, we are exposed to more competition. A summary of our key competitors by end market within each of our segments follows:

International

Consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth, we continue to increase our expansion into international markets, particularly in developing economies in South America, Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.

Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and, with increasing emphasis, Australia, Canada, China, Malaysia, India, Mexico, Brazil, Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

The following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the U.S. as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years, by segment and in total:

Our international operations are subject to certain risks, such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and non-U.S. governmental restrictions, which are discussed further in Item 1A. "Risk Factors."  For additional details regarding our non-U.S. revenue and



the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations, see

Note 17 — Segment Information

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Environmental Matters

Sustainability

In response to our concerns around global sustainability,

i

n 2010, we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of our greenhouse gas emissions. Since then, we have evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities, as well as developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes goals, objectives and related projects for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. To further promote our sustainability efforts, we have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20% from 2010 to 2020. We are near our goal for reducing overall energy intensity and have surpassed our goal for reducing greenhouse gas intensity. We will continue to work proactively to reduce energy usage and carbon emissions amidst acquisition and business growth. We have also participated as a voluntary respondent in the Carbon Disclosure Project since 2010 and have maintained our scoring range since we began reporting.

All of our segments assess the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the opportunities associated with the use of their products and services by customers. In some instances, our businesses may be able to help customers reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Increased demand for energy-efficient products based on a variety of drivers could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses.

Other Matters

Our operations are governed by a variety of international, national, state and local environmental laws. We are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws. In a few instances, particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances. Where necessary, these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance.

There have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment. We are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehouse/distribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses. We anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short- to medium-term. We expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in "pass through" costs from energy suppliers, suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations.

Employees

We had approximately

29,000

employees as of

December 31, 2017

Other Information

We make available through the "Investor Information" link on our website, www.dovercorporation.com, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports. We post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information on our website is not incorporated into this Form 10-K.



ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS

The risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

•

Our results may be impacted by current domestic and international economic conditions and uncertainties.

Our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate. These circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations, particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce.

Our Energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact drilling and production, with overall demand for our products and services impacted by depletion rates, global economic conditions and related energy demands.

Negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control, are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and cost of capital.

•

We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.

Approximately

44%

and

42%

of our revenues for


and


, respectively, were derived outside the United States. We continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. Our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:

If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets, our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.



•

Trends in oil and natural gas prices may affect the drilling and production activity, profitability and financial stability of our customers and therefore the demand for, and profitability of, our energy products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The oil and gas industry is cyclical in nature and experiences periodic downturns of varying length and severity. Most recently, the oil and gas industry experienced a significant downturn in 2015 and 2016. Demand for our energy products and services is sensitive to the level of drilling and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. The level of drilling and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices. Oil and gas prices and the level of drilling and production activity have been characterized by significant volatility in recent years. In particular, the prices of oil and natural gas were highly volatile in 2014 and 2015 on significant over supply and declined dramatically.

Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, geopolitical developments and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control. Prices of oil began to recover in late 2016 but there can be no assurance that increases will continue. We expect continued volatility in both crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as in the level of drilling and production related activities. Given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects, another future significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in the reduction in demand for our energy and pumps products and services, and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

•

The proposed spin-off of Wellsite may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits.

We have previously announced in 2017 a plan to pursue a tax-free spin-off of our Wellsite business into a standalone, publicly-traded company. We expect to complete the spin-off in May of 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions. However, unanticipated developments, including delays in obtaining tax rulings, changes in the macroeconomic environment, uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes could delay or prevent the proposed spin-off or cause the proposed spin-off to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. Even if the transaction is completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spin-off.  We also have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the proposed spin-off which may exceed our current expectations.

Executing the proposed spin-off requires significant time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business. Additionally, our employees may be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles pending the completion of the spin-off. Following the proposed spin-off, the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed spin-off not occurred. In addition, investor sentiment could result in excess selling causing greater volatility in our share price following the consummation of the proposed spin-off. Finally, if we fail to complete the spin-off, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets.

•

If the Wellsite spin-off, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.

A condition to the spin-off is the receipt by us of either (i) a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS Ruling") together with an opinion of McDermott Will & Emery LLP, our tax counsel, substantially to the effect that, among other things, certain transactions to effect the spin-off will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), and the distribution will qualify as a tax-free distribution to our shareholders under Section 355 of the Code, or (ii) an opinion of McDermott Will & Emery LLP, our tax counsel, substantially to the effect that, among other things, certain transactions to effect the spin-off will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and the distribution of shares of Wellsite will qualify as a tax-free distribution to our shareholders under Section 355 of the Code. The IRS Ruling (if obtained) and the opinion of tax counsel will rely on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings from us and Wellsite, including those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the IRS Ruling (if obtained) or the opinion, and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling (if obtained) and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions



in the opinion. In addition, we and Wellsite intend for certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law.

If the distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. For example, if the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, we would, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be treated as if we had sold the Wellsite common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our shareholders who are subject to U.S. federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Wellsite common stock received in the distribution. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, we could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law, respectively.

•

Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.

We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Pound Sterling, Swiss franc, Chinese Renminbi (Yuan), Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the Euro and U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.

•

Increasing product/service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.

Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, new business models and technologies and pricing pressures. If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services and/or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.

•

Our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.

The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Certain of our businesses sell their products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which may result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services.  Failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences, to deliver high quality, innovative and competitive products to the market, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to third-party technologies and to stimulate customer demand for, and convince customers to adopt, new products and services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market.



•

Our businesses and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.

Our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in laws, regulations and policies (including environmental and employment regulations, data security laws, data privacy laws, export/import laws, tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations and other similar programs). Failure to comply with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation. We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws, including environmental protection, employment, data security, data privacy and health and safety laws, will not exceed our estimates. In addition, we have invested in certain countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation.

Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments.

•

We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials (including energy) or if we are unable to obtain raw materials.

We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations, which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities. Significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses. While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors. In addition, while raw materials are generally available now, the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

•

Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.

We expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts, then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected. In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations. We may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated, may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets. These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

•

Our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if we cannot achieve projected savings and synergies.

We are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded rightsizing and other related costs of $56.3 million to better align our cost structure in preparation for the Wellsite separation. These rightsizing activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction



activities  (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) may reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize through our various programs. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

•

Our operations, businesses and products are subject to cybersecurity risks.

We depend on our own and third party information technology (“IT”) systems, including cloud-based systems, to store and process information and support our business activities. We also use our third party IT systems to support customer business activities, such as transmitting payment information, providing mobile monitoring services, and capturing operational data. Additionally, some of our products contain computer hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to computer networks. If these technologies, systems, products or services are damaged, cease to function properly, are compromised due to employee error, user error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software, or other intrusions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, our business may be adversely impacted. The impacts could include production downtimes, operational delays, and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers; compromise of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal and customer data; destruction, corruption, or theft of data; manipulation, disruption, or improper use of these technologies, systems, products or services; financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage;  and legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions; and damage to our reputation. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls, a breach response plan, maintenance of backup and protective systems, and security personnel, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise.

•

Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses, including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances, or claims related to patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.

We may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects, to cause property damage, to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined there was a quality issue with a product component part in the Fluids segment and voluntarily reported this issue to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”). During the first quarter of 2017, we announced a voluntary recall of the product in conjunction with the CPSC.

See Note 14 — Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

•

The indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.

Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet



their indemnification responsibilities. Similarly, the purchasers of our discontinued operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

•

Failure to attract, retain and develop personnel or to provide adequate succession plans for key management could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our growth, profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel, align them with appropriate opportunities and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions and support for strategic initiatives. If we are unsuccessful in these efforts, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected and we could miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies.

•

Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.

While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate United States and/or non-United States laws or fail to protect our confidential information, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

•

Our revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.

Our businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights. Our businesses employ various measures to develop, maintain and protect their intellectual property rights. These measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights, and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of our businesses' intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

•

A significant decline in the future economic outlook of our businesses and expected future cash flows could result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges which would negatively impact our results of operations.

We have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of current and past acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair market value. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our businesses could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill. Charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized.

•

Our borrowing costs may be impacted by our credit ratings developed by various rating agencies.

Three major ratings agencies (Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings) evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our short-term and long-term debt as of

December 31, 2017

. Although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings, if our current credit ratings deteriorate, then our borrowing costs could increase, including increased fees under our five-year credit facility, and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected.



•

If we experience work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, our productivity and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

We have a number of collective bargaining units in the United States and various foreign collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, reputation, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

ITEM 1B.   UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

The number, type, location and size of the properties used by our operations as of

December 31, 2017

are shown in the following charts, by segment:

Our owned and leased facilities are well-maintained and suitable for our operations.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

A few of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among "potentially responsible parties." In each instance, the extent of the subsidiary’s liability appears to be relatively insignificant in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other "potentially responsible parties" involved and it is anticipated to be immaterial to us on a consolidated basis. In addition, a few of our subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been established. At

December 31, 2017

and


, we have reserves totaling

$35.4

million and

$30.0

million, respectively, for environmental and other matters, including private party claims for exposure to hazardous substances, that are probable and estimable.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses. These proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of use of the Company’s products, exposure to hazardous substances, patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. Management and legal counsel, at least quarterly, review the probable outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred and currently accrued to-date and the availability and extent of insurance coverage. The Company has reserves for other legal matters that are probable and estimable and at

December 31, 2017

and


, these reserves are not significant. While it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal actions, in the opinion of management, based on the aforementioned reviews, the Company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

0.6%

on revenue for the year.

Within our Engineered Systems segment, revenue

increased

$210.0 million

, or

8.9%

, from the prior year, reflecting organic

growth

of

5.6%

, acquisition-related

growth

of

6.7%

and

a favorable

impact from foreign currency of

0.9%

, partially offset by a

4.3%

impact from dispositions. Organic growth was broad-based across both the Printing & Identification and Industrials platforms. Our Fluids segment revenue

increased

$550.3 million

, or

32.4%

, comprised of acquisition-related

growth

of

29.3%

, organic

growth

of

2.8%

and

a favorable

foreign currency impact of

0.3%

. The organic growth was principally driven by industrial pump activity and solid hygienic and pharma markets partially offset by continued weakness in transport markets. Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, revenue

decreased

$21.2 million

, or

1.3%

, from the prior year, including a

5.1%

decline

due to a disposition, partially offset by organic revenue

growth

of

3.4%

and

a favorable

impact from foreign currency translation of

0.4%

. The organic growth was driven primarily by demand for refrigeration systems and heat exchangers in our Refrigeration business. Our Energy segment revenue

increased

$297.8 million

, or

26.9%

, from the prior year, comprised of organic revenue

growth

of

26.8%

and acquisition-related

growth

of

0.2%

, partially offset by

an unfavorable

impact from foreign currency translation of

0.1%

. The increase in organic revenue within our Energy segment was driven primarily by increases in U.S. rig count and well completions.

Gross profit was

$2.9 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

, an

increase

of

$418.4 million

, or

16.9%

, as compared to the prior year. The

increase

was primarily due to the growth in sales volumes as well as the benefits of prior restructuring actions, and a reduction to a voluntary product recall accrual of

$7.2 million

compared to charge of

$23.2 million

in 2016. Gross profit margin was

36.9%

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

compared to

36.4%

for the prior year. For further discussion related to our consolidated and segment results, see "Consolidated Results of Operations" and "Segment Results of Operations," respectively, within MD&A.

Bookings increased 17.0% over the prior year at

$8.0 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

. Included in this result was a 9.6% increase in organic bookings, a 9.8% increase in acquisition-related bookings and a 0.2% favorable impact due to foreign exchange rates, which were partially offset by a 2.6% decline due to dispositions. Bookings increased 35.7%, 30.7% and 11.6% within our Fluids, Energy and Engineered Systems segments, respectively, while bookings in our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment decreased 3.8%. Overall, our book-to-bill increased from the prior year to 1.02. Backlog as of

December 31, 2017

was

$1.2 billion

, up from

$1.1 billion

from the prior year.

From a geographic perspective, our U.S., European and China markets all grew organically year-over-year.

On December 7, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a plan to spin-off our upstream energy businesses within the our Energy segment, collectively, the “Wellsite” business, through a U.S. tax-free spin-off to shareholders. We expect to complete the separation in May of 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions. We have incurred

$15.3 million

of costs associated with the transaction which were recorded as a corporate expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. These transaction costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, legal and information system functions. Upon separation, the historical results of

Wellsite

will be presented as discontinued operations.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded rightsizing and other related costs of

$56.3 million

to better align our cost structure in preparation for the Wellsite separation. The

$56.3 million

is comprised of $45.8 million of restructuring costs and $10.5 million of other charges. These costs relate to actions taken on employee reductions, facility consolidations and site closures and product line divestitures and exits. These charges were broad based across all segments as well as corporate, with costs incurred of

$9.2 million

in Engineered Systems, $8.2 million in Fluids, $15.3 million in Refrigeration & Food Equipment,

$7.3 million

in Energy and $16.3 million at Corporate. These charges were recorded in cost of goods and services, selling, general and administrative expenses, gain on sale of businesses, and other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

We recorded a net tax benefit of

$50.9 million

primarily relating to the enactment of the U.S. bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”) during the fourth quarter of 2017. The benefit was comprised of a

$172.0 million

benefit related to the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, offset by a

$115.0 million

provisional tax expense related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and

$11.0 million

of anticipated local withholding tax expense associated with planned cash distributions to the U.S from non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The net tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 also included a benefit of $4.9 million related to decreases in statutory tax rates of foreign jurisdictions.

On a full year basis, the effective tax rate for 2017 was

16.7%

.

For the full year


, Dover made a total of

three

acquisitions totaling

$43.1 million

, net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration. We completed the acquisition of Caldera Graphics S.A.S. ("Caldera") for approximately

$32.9 million

, net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration. Caldera enhances our ability to serve the global digital textile printing market with their high-quality technical software designed for the digital printing industry. Caldera is included in the Printing & Identification platform within the Engineered Systems segment.

See Note 3 — Acquisitions

in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details regarding the businesses acquired during the year. Subsequently, in January 2018,we acquired Ettlinger Group, a leading manufacturer of filtering solutions for the plastics recycling industry, for

€50.0 million

(approximately

$60.0 million

) and Rosario Handel B.V., a manufacturer of decorator and base coating machinery used in the production of beverage, food and aerosol cans for

€13.5 million

(approximately

$16.2 million

). These acquisitions enhance our ability to serve our respective markets within the Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments.

In addition, in


, as part of the regular review of our portfolio and the fit of our businesses, we completed the divestitures of Performance Motorsports International ("PMI"), a manufacturer of pistons and other engine related components, and the consumer and industrial winch business of Warn Industries Inc. ("Warn"), both within our Engineered Systems segment. These disposals did not represent strategic shifts in operations and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations. We sold the PMI and Warn businesses for total consideration of

$147.3 million

and

$250.3 million

, respectively. The disposition of PMI resulted in pre-tax gain on sale of

$88.4 million

, and we recorded a 25% equity method investment at fair value as well as a subordinated note receivable. The disposition of Warn resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of

$116.9 million

and we also recorded

$5.2 million

of disposition costs.

See Note 4 — Disposed and Discontinued Operations

in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these disposed businesses.

During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, we purchased

1.1 million

shares of our common stock for a total cost of

$105.0 million

, or

$99.11

per share. We also continued our long history of increasing our annual dividend payments to shareholders and paid a total of

$284.0 million

in dividends to our shareholders.



CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

* nm: not meaningful

Revenue

For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, revenue

increased

$1.0 billion

, or

15.2%

to

$7.8 billion

compared with


, reflecting organic

growth

of

7.8%

, acquisition-related growth of

9.7%

and

a favorable

impact from foreign currency translation of

0.4%

, partially offset by a

2.7%

impact from dispositions. Growth in organic revenue was largely driven by improved market conditions in U.S. oil and gas-related end markets for the Energy segment, as well as strong broad-based activity in the Engineered Systems segment. Organic growth also reflected strong shipments in our Pumps and Hygienic & Pharma businesses in the Fluids segment and solid retail refrigeration activity in the Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment. Acquisition-related growth of

9.7%

was led by the Fluids and Engineered Systems segments, largely due to the full-year benefit from the 2016 acquisitions of Wayne Fueling Systems Ltd. ("Wayne") within our Fluids segment and Ravaglioli S.p.A Group ("RAV") within our Engineered Systems segment, as well as the 2017 acquisition of Caldera Graphics S.A.S. ("Caldera") within our Engineered Systems segment. Overall customer pricing was favorable, impacting consolidated revenue

0.6%

.

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, revenue

decreased

$162.0 million

, or

2.3%

to

$6.8 billion

compared with


, reflecting an organic

decline

of

5.4%

, a

3.0%

impact from dispositions and an unfavorable impact of

1.0%

from foreign currency translation, offset by

growth

from acquisitions of

7.1%

. Decline in organic revenue was attributable to weakness in U.S. oil and gas-related end markets as well as reduced capital spending by our customers. Acquisition-related growth of 7.1% was largely driven by the acquisitions of Tokheim Group S.A.S. ("Tokheim") and Wayne within our Fluids segment and RAV within our Engineered Systems segment, as well as the full-year benefit from the fourth quarter 2015 acquisitions.



Gross Profit

For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, gross profit

increased

$

418.4 million

, or

16.9%

, to

$2.9 billion

compared with


, primarily due to growth in sales volumes and benefits of prior restructuring actions, as well as a reduction of a product recall accrual of

$7.2 million

compared to a fourth quarter 2016 charge of

$23.2 million

. Gross profit margin increased 50 basis points primarily due to margin improvements in our Engineered Systems and Energy segments.

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, gross profit

decreased

$96.2 million

, or

3.7%

to

$2.5 billion

compared with


, primarily due to the decline in sales volumes and a product recall charge of

$23.2 million

, partially offset by supply chain cost containment initiatives and the benefits of prior restructuring actions. Gross profit margin declined 50 basis points primarily due to margin declines in our Energy segment.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, selling, general and administrative expenses

increased

$

218.4 million

, or

12.4%

to

$2.0 billion

compared with


, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions in 2016, including acquisition-related amortization expense of $15.7 million, Wellsite separation costs of

$15.3 million

, higher restructuring charges of

$10.8 million

, disposition-related costs for Warn of

$5.2 million

and increased compensation costs. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 70 basis points in


to

25.2%

, reflecting the leverage of costs on a higher revenue base, partially offset by the aforementioned increases in expenses.

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, selling, general and administrative expenses

increased

$110.1 million

, or

6.7%

to

$1.8 billion

compared with


reflecting the impact of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition-related deal costs and increased headcount. The increase is also impacted by increased investment in DBS, offset by lower restructuring charges and the benefits of previously implemented cost reduction actions. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 220 basis points in 2016 to 25.9%, reflecting deleveraging of fixed administrative costs and acquisition-related costs on lower revenue.

Non-Operating Items

Interest Expense

For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, interest expense, net of interest income,

increased

$7.1 million

, or

5.4%

, to

$136.7 million

compared with


due to the full year impact of the fourth quarter 2016 issuance of the

€600 million

of 1.25% euro-denominated notes and higher interest rates on commercial paper in 2017.

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, interest expense, net of interest income, increased

$2.4 million

, or

1.9%

, to

$129.6 million

compared with 2015. This increase was due to higher interest rates on commercial paper year over year and the fourth quarter 2016 issuance of the

€600 million

of 1.25% euro-denominated notes, offset in part by the full year impact of lower interest on $400.0 million, 3.15% notes which replaced the $300.0 million, 4.875% notes in October 2015.

Other expense (income), net

For the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


, other expense (income), net was

$7.0 million

,

$(7.9) million

and

$(7.1) million

, respectively. For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, other expense was primarily due to a net foreign exchange loss of $7.2 million resulting from the re-measurement and settlement of foreign currency denominated balances. For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, other income was primarily due to earnings on equity method investments of $3.3 million and a net foreign exchange gain of $2.9 million. For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, other income was primarily due to earnings on equity method investments of $3.3 million and an insurance settlement for property damage of $3.6 million, partially offset by a net foreign exchange loss of $1.6 million.

Gain on sale of businesses

For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, gain on sale of businesses was

$203.1 million

.  The gain was primarily due to the sales of PMI and Warn, both within the Engineered Systems segment, in which we recognized gains on sale of

$88.4 million

and

$116.9 million

, respectively. Other immaterial dispositions completed during the year were recorded as a net loss of

$2.2 million

.



For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, gain on sale of businesses was

$96.6 million

. The gain was primarily due to the sales of Texas Hydraulics ("THI"), a custom manufacturer of fluid power components within the Engineered Systems segment, and Tipper Tie, a global supplier of processing and clip packaging machines within the Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment.  Upon disposal of THI and Tipper Tie, we recognized gains on sale of

$11.9 million

and

$85.0 million

, respectively.

These disposals did not represent strategic shifts in operations and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.

Income Taxes

Our businesses span the globe with

36.2%

,

39.0%

and

33.8%

of our pre-tax earnings in


,


and


, respectively, generated in foreign jurisdictions. Foreign earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the 35.0% U.S. statutory tax rate as of

December 31, 2017

. As a result, our effective non-U.S. tax rate is typically significantly lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. Effective January 1, 2018, the U.S. statutory rate will decrease to 21.0%.

Our effective tax rate was

16.7%

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

, compared to

26.2%

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

. The


and


rates were impacted by

$46.9 million

and

$13.6 million

, respectively, of favorable net discrete items. We recorded a provisional net tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 of

$50.9 million

primarily related to the Tax Reform Act. The final impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, issuance of additional regulatory guidance, changes in interpretations and assumptions we made, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act. We recorded a

$172.0 million

benefit related to the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate. We also recorded provisional tax expense of

$115.0 million

related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We plan to make cash distributions to the U.S from non-U.S. subsidiaries of up to an estimated

$450.0 million

, and consequently we have recorded

$11.0 million

of anticipated local withholding tax expense associated with these planned distributions.

The net tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 also included a benefit of $4.9 million related to decreases in statutory tax rates of foreign jurisdictions.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the discrete items were primarily driven by the adjustment of tax accounts to the U.S. tax return filed.

For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, our effective tax rate on continuing operations was 25.6%. The effective tax rate was impacted by favorable net discrete items totaling $17.5 million, principally related to settlements of uncertain tax matters.

We believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. This decrease may result in an income tax benefit. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state, and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to

$14.1 million

. We believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties.

Earnings from Continuing Operations

For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, earnings from continuing operations

increased

$302.8 million

, or

59.5%

, to

$811.7 million

, or EPS of

$5.15

, compared with earnings from continuing operations of

$508.9 million

, or EPS of

$3.25

, for the year ended

December 31, 2016

. The 2017 results include a net benefit of

$172.6

million, or EPS of

$1.09

, from dispositions, a net tax benefit primarily from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of

$50.9 million

, or EPS of

$0.32

, and a net benefit of

$4.6

million, or EPS of

$0.03

, from a reduction to a previously recorded product recall accrual. Results also included rightsizing and other costs of

$39.1

million, or EPS of

$0.25

, Wellsite separation related costs of

$9.7

million, or EPS of

$0.06

, and disposition costs of

$3.2 million

, or EPS of

$0.02

. Excluding these aforementioned benefits and costs, earnings from continuing operations increased

39%

in 2017 as a result of higher earnings due to increased sales volumes, partially offset by higher weighted average shares outstanding relative to 2016.

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, earnings from continuing operations

decreased

$87.0 million

, or

14.6%

, to

$508.9 million

, or EPS of

$3.25

, compared with earnings from continuing operations of

$595.9 million

, or EPS of

$3.74

, for the year ended

December 31, 2015

. The 2016 and 2015 results include discrete tax benefits of

$13.6 million

, or EPS of $0.09, and $17.5 million, or EPS of $0.11, respectively. Excluding these discrete tax benefits, earnings from continuing operations decreased 14.4% in 2016 primarily due to lower revenues, a product recall charge of

$23.2 million

and acquisition-related expenses. EPS decreased in 2016 as a result of lower earnings, partially offset by lower weighted average shares outstanding relative to 2015.



Discontinued Operations

There were no earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, earnings from discontinued operations of

$273.9 million

primarily includes the gain on sale of $265.6 million as a result of the sale of Datamax O'Neil and Sargent Aerospace and $6.3 million of earnings attributable to those businesses prior to their disposal.

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our four reportable operating segments (Engineered Systems, Fluids, Refrigeration & Food Equipment and Energy).  Each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple end markets.

See Note 17 — Segment Information

in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment revenue, earnings and margin to our consolidated revenue, earnings from continuing operations and margin. Segment EBITDA and segment EBITDA margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors.  For further information, see "Non-GAAP Disclosures" at the end of this Item 7.

Engineered Systems

Our Engineered Systems segment is comprised of two platforms, Printing & Identification and Industrials, and

is focused on the design, manufacture and service of critical equipment, consumables and components serving the fast-moving consumer goods, digital textile printing, vehicle service, environmental solutions and industrial end markets.

impact from dispositions. Customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 0.3% in


.

•

Printing & Identification revenue (representing

42.5%

of segment revenue)

increased

$71.5 million

, or

7.0%

, compared to the prior year. Organic revenue of 4.6%, acquisition-related growth of 0.9% from Caldera and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 1.5% all contributed to year over year growth. Organic revenue growth was driven by our marking and coding and digital printing businesses.

•

Industrials revenue (representing

57.5%

of segment revenue)

increased

$138.5 million

, or

, compared to the prior year. The increase reflects acquisition-related growth of 11.1% from the RAV and AWTI acquisitions, organic revenue growth of 6.4% and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.5%. This increase was partially offset by the impact of dispositions of 7.7%. Organic revenue growth was broad-based, with particular strength in our environmental solutions business.

Engineered Systems segment earnings for the year ended

December 31, 2017

increased

$198.6 million

, or

50.7%

, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by $193.4 million of incremental gains on the sale of divested businesses including Warn and PMI in 2017 and THI in 2016, partially offset by $17.3 million of lower earnings due to divested businesses, $8.8 million of incremental restructuring expenses and $5.2 million of Warn divestiture costs. Excluding these items, adjusted segment earnings increased $36.5 million or 9.3% compared to the prior year driven by leverage on organic growth in our marking and coding and industrial businesses, partially offset by increases in material costs, most notably steel, and key strategic investments. Segment margin increased from

16.6%

to

22.9%

as compared to the prior year primarily due to the 2017 gains on dispositions.

Segment bookings for the year ended

of


segment revenue)

increased

$78.8 million

, or

8.4%

, compared to the prior year. The growth in organic revenue of 4.8% and acquisition-related growth of 6.0% was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 2.5%. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by solid activity in our global marking and coding and digital printing businesses.

•

Industrials revenue (representing

56.8%

of


segment revenue)

decreased

$55.5 million

, or

4.0%

, compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the disposition in the first quarter of 2016 of THI of 6.4%, a decrease in organic revenue of 0.4% and a minimal unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 0.4%. These declines were partially offset by acquisition-related growth of 3.3% from JK Group and RAV. The organic revenue decline was primarily impacted by reduced demand in our environmental solutions business, along with general softness in industrials markets. This decrease was partially offset by strong growth in our vehicle service business.



Engineered Systems segment earnings for the year ended

FINANCIAL CONDITION

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchase of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. We generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions.

Cash Flow Summary

The following table is derived from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2017

decreased

$40.4 million

compared to


. This decline was driven primarily by timing of year end revenue, increased tax payments of

$167.6 million

, which includes

$69.0 million

of federal and state tax payments for dispositions, as well as

$9.5 million

of cash paid for Wellsite separation. This decline was offset by higher continuing earnings of

$183.7 million

, excluding non-cash activity from depreciation and amortization, gain on sale of businesses and the impact of the Tax Reform Act.

Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2016

decreased

$87.1 million

compared to


. This decline was driven primarily by lower continuing earnings of $149.9 million, excluding depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of businesses, partially offset by improvements in working capital (excluding acquisitions and dispositions), as well as lower cash outflows for employee incentives and net tax payments.

Pension and Other Post-Retirement Activity:

Total cash used in conjunction with pension plans during


was

$20.5 million

including contributions to our international pension plans and payments of benefits under our non-qualified supplemental pension plan.

The funded status of our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and the level of funding. We contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. Due to the overfunded status of this plan, the Company made no contributions in


,


and


and expects to make minimal contributions, if any, in the near term.

Our international pension obligations are located in regions where it is not economically advantageous to pre-fund the plans due to local regulations. Total cash contributions to ongoing international defined benefit pension plans in


,


and


totaled

$8.0 million

,

$8.4 million

and $8.4 million, respectively. In


, we expect to contribute approximately

$3.5 million

to our non-U.S. plans. Our non-qualified supplemental pension plans are funded through Company assets as benefits are paid. During


a total of

$11.6 million

benefits were paid under these plans.

See Note 15 — Employee Benefit Plans

in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our post-retirement plans.



Adjusted Working Capital:

We believe adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing changes caused solely by revenue.

Adjusted working capital

decreased

from

December 31, 2016

by

$20.6 million

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Investing Activities

Cash flow from investing activities is derived from cash inflows from proceeds from sales of businesses, property, plant and equipment and short-term investments, partially offset by cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions. The majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following:

•

Acquisitions:

In


, we deployed

$36.0 million

to acquire

three

businesses. In comparison, we acquired

six

business in


for an aggregate purchase price of approximately

$1,561.7 million

. Total acquisition spend in


was

$567.8 million

and was comprised of

four

businesses.

See Note 3 — Acquisitions

in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information with respect to recent acquisitions.

•

Proceeds from sale of businesses:

In


, we generated cash proceeds of

$372.7 million

, primarily from the sale of PMI and Warn. Cash proceeds of

$206.4 million

in


were primarily from the sale of THI and Tipper Tie. In


, we generated cash proceeds of

$689.3 million

primarily from the sale of Datamax O'Neil and Sargent Aerospace.

•

Capital spending:

Capital expenditures, primarily to support productivity and new product launches, were

$196.7 million

in


,

$165.2 million

in


and

$154.3 million

in


. Our capital expenditures

increased

$31.5 million

in the


period as compared to


, primarily within Fluids.

We anticipate that capital expenditures and any additional acquisitions we make in


will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, or by accessing the public debt or equity markets.

Financing Activities

Our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of share-based awards.  The majority of financing activity was attributed to the following:

•

Long-term debt, commercial paper and notes payable, net:

During 2017, we decreased net borrowings from commercial paper by

$183.2 million

with the cash proceeds from the sale of PMI and Warn. In November 2016, we issued €600.0 million of 1.25% euro-denominated notes due in 2026. The proceeds of

$656.4 million

from this issuance, net of discounts and issuance costs, were primarily used for payment of a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of Wayne. During the


period, we increased net borrowings from commercial paper by

$254.8 million

primarily for purposes of funding acquisitions. During 2015, we decreased net borrowings from commercial paper by

$327.0 million

, we repaid the $300.0 million of 4.875% notes, which matured October 15, 2015, and we issued $400.0 million of 3.150% notes realizing cash proceeds of $394.3 million, net of discounts and issuance costs.

•

Treasury purchases:

In January 2015, our Board of Directors approved a new standing share repurchase authorization, whereby the Company was authorized to repurchase up to 15 million shares of its common stock over the following



three years. These share repurchases are opportunistic buybacks made as part of management's capital allocation strategy. These repurchases are also made to offset the dilutive impact of shares issued under our equity compensation plans. In 2017, we used

$105.0 million

to repurchase

1.1 million

shares under this authorization. During 2016, we did not purchase any shares under this program. In 2015, we completed the repurchase of

8.2 million

shares at a total cost of

$600.2 million

under this authorization. As of

December 31, 2017

, the number of shares available for repurchase under the January 2015 share repurchase authorization was

5.7 million

. In

February 2018

, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new standing share repurchase authorization, whereby the Company may repurchase up to

20 million

shares of its common stock

through December 31, 2020

. This share repurchase authorization replaces the January 2015 share repurchase authorization which expired on January 9, 2018.

•

Dividend payments:

Total dividend payments to common shareholders were

$284.0 million

in


,

$268.3 million

in


and

$258.0 million

in


.  Our dividends paid per common share increased 6% to

$1.82

per share in


compared to

$1.72

per share in


. This represents the 62nd consecutive year that our dividend has increased.

•

Net Proceeds from the exercise of share-based awards:

There were no proceeds from the exercise of share-based awards in 2017. With the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), this activity is reflected in operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2017

, and we have elected to reflect this cash flow presentation prospectively. Proceeds from the exercise of share-based awards were

$8.4 million

and

$4.0 million

in


and


, respectively. These proceeds have fluctuated in recent periods due to the volatility in our stock price and a larger number of cashless exercises of equity awards. Payments to settle tax obligations on these exercises were

$18.4 million

,

$15.7 million

and

$5.0 million

in


,


and


, respectively. These tax payments generally increase or decrease correspondingly to the number of exercises in a particular year.

Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations

There were no cash flows from discontinued operations in


and


. In


, cash used in discontinued operations totaled

$115.9 million

which reflect the operating results of Datamax O'Neil and Sargent Aerospace (prior to their sale in 2015), as well as $110.5 million of taxes paid relating to the gain on the sale of Sargent Aerospace.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Adjusted Free Cash Flow

In addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure adjusted free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) which represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures, plus the add back of cash taxes paid for gains on dispositions (which reflect tax payments on disposition-related investing activities) and cash paid for Wellsite separation costs. We believe that adjusted free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities, such as funding acquisitions, paying dividends, repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock.

The following table reconciles our adjusted free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities:

For


, we generated adjusted free cash flow of

$703.4 million

, representing

9.0%

of revenue. Adjusted free cash flow in


was

$697.6 million

or

10.3%

of revenue, and

$794.8 million

, or

11.4%

of revenue in


. The full year decrease in


adjusted free cash flow reflects lower cash flow provided by operations as a result of timing of revenue at year end and higher capital expenditures, primarily within our Fluids segment.



The


decrease in adjusted free cash flow compared to


reflects lower earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization, higher capital expenditures and timing of revenue at year end, principally in the energy related businesses.

Capitalization

We use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock. We maintain a $1.0 billion five-year unsecured committed revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks which expires on

November 10, 2020

. This facility is used primarily as liquidity back-up for our commercial paper program. We have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so. If we were to draw down a loan, at our election, the loan would bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin. Under this facility, we are required to pay a facility fee and to maintain an interest coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. We were in compliance with this covenant and our other long-term debt covenants at

December 31, 2017

and had a coverage ratio of

11.4 to 1.0

. We are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants.

On March 15, 2018, the outstanding 5.45% notes with a principal value of

$350.0 million

will mature. These notes have been classified as a current maturity of long-term debt as of

December 31, 2017

.  We expect to use a combination of cash and commercial paper to pay off the notes at maturity.

On November 9, 2016, we issued

€600.0 million

of 1.25% euro-denominated notes due 2026. The proceeds of

$656.4 million

from the sale of the notes, net of discounts and issuance costs, were used for payment of a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of Wayne.

We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions.

At

December 31, 2017

, our cash and cash equivalents totaled

$754.0 million

, of which approximately $609.8 million was held outside the United States. Cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in bank deposits with highly rated banks. We regularly hold cash in excess of near-term requirements in bank deposits or invest the funds in government money market instruments or short-term investments, which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, during 2018 we intend to repatriate a significant amount of cash held outside the United States and use the proceeds to pay down commercial paper and/or pay off a portion of the

$350.0 million

notes that will mature on March 15, 2018.

We utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. Net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders' equity. The following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:



Our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased to

39.1%

at

December 31, 2017

compared to

46.3%

at

December 31, 2016

. The decrease in this ratio was driven primarily by the $458.2 million decrease in net debt, as a result of $404.8 million higher cash and cash equivalents due to the aforementioned cash flow activity. The decrease was also impacted by the repayment of commercial paper partially offset by foreign currency translation on our euro-denominated notes.

Our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased to

46.3%

at

December 31, 2016

compared to

39.6%

at

December 31, 2015

primarily due to changes in net debt during the period. Net debt increased $879.5 million during the period primarily due to an increase in long-term debt outstanding due to the

€600 million

notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase in commercial paper borrowings.

Our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing. Our credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, were as follows as of December 31,


:

Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt.

We believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at current risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

As of

December 31, 2017

, we had approximately

$135.4 million

outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions, which expire at various dates in


through


.  These letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance, warranty and other performance obligations. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations, the probability of which we believe is remote.

We have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets, including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. We do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities.



A summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of

December 31, 2017

and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows:

Financial Instruments and Risk Management

The diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highly-rated, diversified counterparties.

Interest Rate Exposure

As of

December 31, 2017

and during the three year period then ended, we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts. However, we may in the future enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. We issue commercial paper, which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates; however, maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would not have a material impact on our pre-tax earnings.

We consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely long-term and fixed-rate in nature. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the


year-end fair value of our long-term debt by approximately $857.4 million.  However, since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturities, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position.



Foreign Currency Exposure

We conduct business in various non-U.S. countries, primarily in Canada, substantially all of the European countries, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, China, India and other Asian countries. Therefore, we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks, when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities. We have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value and/or cash flow hedging programs.

Changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows when translated into U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. We have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in non-U.S. operations. We may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into fair value hedges.

Additionally, the Company has designated the

€300.0 million

and

€600.0 million

of euro-denominated notes issued December 4, 2013 and November 9, 2016, respectively, as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in euro-denominated operations. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the euro-denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment. Accordingly, changes in the value of the euro-denominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income (loss) to offset changes in the value of the net investment in euro-denominated operations. Due to the fluctuations of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar equivalent of this debt increases or decreases, resulting in the recognition of a loss of

$125.3 million

and a gain of

$53.8 million

in other comprehensive income for the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Commodity Price Exposure

Certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities, such as aluminum, steel, copper and various precious metals, among others. Our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials. When possible, we maintain long-term fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts; however, we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire. We may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate our risk to commodity pricing; however, such contracts outstanding at December 31,


were not significant.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of GAAP. GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts we report. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures, including information regarding contingencies, risk and our financial condition. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in

Note 1 — Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to GAAP and is consistently applied. We review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis.

Revenue

Recognition

- Revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured and d) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. The majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. Service revenue represents less than 5% of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed. In limited cases, our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery, installation, testing, certification, or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized. We include shipping costs billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in cost of goods and services.



Inventories

- Inventories for the majority of our subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries, are stated at net realizable value, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or cost. Other domestic inventories are stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventories are employed by us to properly value inventories.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets -

We have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets as a result of current and past acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. In addition, the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair market value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist.

When performing an impairment test, we estimate fair value using the income-based valuation method. Under the income-based valuation method, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rate based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The discount rates used in these analyses vary by reporting unit and are based on a capital asset pricing model and published relevant industry rates.  We use discount rates commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent to each reporting unit and in our internally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in our


reporting unit valuations ranged from

8.5%

to

10.0%

.

We performed the annual goodwill impairment testing of our

ten

identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of


. Based on the impairment tests performed, the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value, in most cases, by more than 100% and, in no case, less than 80%. As such, no goodwill impairment was recognized. While we believe the assumptions used in the


impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results, if market conditions worsen or persist for an extended period of time, an impairment of goodwill or assets may occur. We will continue to monitor the long-term outlook and forecasts, including estimated future cash flows, for these businesses and the impact on the carrying value of goodwill and assets.

Employee Benefit Plans

- The valuation of our pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits and mortality rates. Annually, we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation. Our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit payment streams. The plans’ expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates.  As disclosed in

Note 15 — Employee Benefit Plans

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the


weighted-average discount rates used to measure our qualified defined benefit ranged from

1.94%

to

3.65%

, a decrease from the


rates, which ranged from

2.06%

to

4.10%

. The lower


discount rates are reflective of decreased market interest rates over this period. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the post-retirement benefit obligations by approximately

$36.0 million

from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements at December 31,


. Our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately

$1.8 million

.

Income Taxes

- We have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated, using more likely than not criteria, for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues that are currently unresolved. We routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves. Reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax codes and rulings (as further described below with respect to U.S. tax law), changes in statutory tax rates and our future taxable income levels. The provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized



upon ultimate settlement. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was enacted, which significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Act also provided for a one-time deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits (“E&P”) through the year ended December 31, 2017. The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ("GILTI") provisions of the Tax Reform Act also require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. The Company expects that it will be subject to incremental U.S. tax on GILTI income beginning in 2018, due to expense allocations required by the U.S. foreign tax credit rules. The Company has elected to account for GILTI tax in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore has not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. We have recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the benefit for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and included these amounts in its Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The final impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act. In accordance with SAB 118 the financial reporting impact of the Tax Reform Act will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Risk, Retention, Insurance

-

We have significant accruals and reserves related to the self-insured portion of our risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. We estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, our experience and relevant industry data. We review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience.

Contingencies

- We have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense. The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues. While we believe that the amount accrued to-date is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations.

Restructuring

- We establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation when management has committed to an exit or reorganization plan and when termination benefits are probable and can be reasonably estimated based on circumstances at the time the restructuring plan is approved by management or when termination benefits are communicated. Exit costs include future minimum lease payments on vacated facilities and other contractual terminations. In addition, asset impairments may be recorded as a result of an approved restructuring plan.  The accrual of both severance and exit costs requires the use of estimates. Though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts.

Disposed and Discontinued Operations

- From time to time we sell or discontinue or dispose of certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, including goodwill, to their estimated fair market value. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. Fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similar-type entities. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. No impairment charges were recorded in


,


or


.

Stock-Based Compensation -

We are required to recognize in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings the expense associated with all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock units and performance share awards. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of SARs granted



to employees. The model requires that we estimate the expected life of the SAR, expected forfeitures and the volatility of our stock using historical data. For additional information related to the assumptions used, see

Note 13 — Equity and Cash Incentive Program

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Recent Accounting Standards

See

Note 1 — Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and recently adopted accounting standards.

Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we also disclose non-GAAP information which we believe provides useful information to investors. Segment EBITDA, segment EBITDA margin, adjusted free cash flow, net debt, net capitalization, the net debt to net capitalization ratio, adjusted working capital and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for earnings, cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, working capital or revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that segment EBITDA and segment EBITDA margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We do not present segment net income because corporate expenses are not allocated at a segment level. Segment EBITDA margin is calculated as segment EBITDA divided by segment revenue.

We believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and adjusted free cash flow are important measures of liquidity. Net debt to net capitalization ratio is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ. Adjusted free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase our common stock. Reconciliations of adjusted free cash flow, net debt and net capitalization can be found above in this Item 7, MD&A. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital, which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue. We believe that reporting organic revenue and organic revenue growth, which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013).

Based on its assessment under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013), management concluded that, as of December 31,


, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To

the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Dover Corporation:

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated

balance sheets of Dover Corporation and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company

as of December 31, 2017 and 2016,

and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated

financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated

financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated

financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated

financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated

financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated

financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide



reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We have served as the Company's auditor since 1995.

1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Dover Corporation ("Dover" or "Company") is a diversified global manufacturer delivering innovative equipment and components, specialty systems, consumable supplies, software and digital solutions and support services. The Company also provides supporting engineering, testing and other similar services, which are not significant in relation to consolidated revenue. The Company’s businesses are based primarily in the United States of America and Europe with manufacturing and other operations throughout the world. The Company operates through

four

business segments that are aligned with the key end markets they serve: Engineered Systems, Fluids, Refrigeration & Food Equipment and Energy. For additional information on the Company’s segments, see

Note 17 — Segment Information

.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included from the dates of acquisitions. As discussed in

Note 4 — Disposed and Discontinued Operations

, the Company reported certain businesses as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The results of operations and cash flows of these businesses have been separately reported as discontinued operations in 2015.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates may be adjusted due to changes in future economic, industry, or customer financial conditions, as well as changes in technology or demand. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, net realizable value of inventories, restructuring reserves, warranty reserves, pension and post-retirement plans, stock-based compensation, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not believe such differences would materially affect the consolidated financial statements in any individual year. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period that they are determined.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments, which are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities at the time of purchase of

three months or less

. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are recorded at face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is an estimate based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of each customer's trade accounts receivable. Management evaluates the aging of the accounts receivable balances and the financial condition of its customers to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected in the future and records the appropriate provision.

Inventories

Inventories for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the lower of net realizable value, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or cost. Other domestic inventories are stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value.



DOVER CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment includes the historical cost of land, buildings, machinery and equipment, purchased software and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment or, in the case of acquisitions, a fair market value appraisal of assets. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts and the gain or loss realized on disposition is reflected in earnings. The Company depreciates its assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: buildings and improvements 5 to 31.5 years; machinery and equipment 3 to 7 years; furniture and fixtures 3 to 7 years; vehicles 3 years; and software 3 to 10 years.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to various risks, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and does not have a material portfolio of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at inception of the contract. The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value.  For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the derivatives and of the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings and subsequently recognized in net earnings when the hedged items impact earnings.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives (primarily trademarks) are not amortized. For goodwill, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired, or when some portion but not all of a reporting unit is disposed of or classified as assets held for sale. Based on its current organizational structure, the Company identified

ten

reporting units for which cash flows are determinable and to which goodwill may be allocated.

The Company performs its goodwill impairment test annually in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level. A quantitative test is used to determine existence of goodwill impairment and the amount of the impairment loss at the reporting unit level. The quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company uses an income-based valuation method, determining the present value of estimated future cash flows, to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Factors used in the impairment analysis require significant judgment, and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. The Company uses its own market assumptions including internal projections of future cash flows, discount rates and other assumptions considered reasonable and inherent in the analysis. These forecasts are based on historical performance and future estimated results. The discount rates used in these analyses vary by reporting unit and are based on a capital asset pricing model and published relevant industry rates. The Company uses discount rates commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent to each reporting unit and in the internally developed forecasts.

See Note 7 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

for further discussion of the Company's annual goodwill impairment test and results.

The Company uses an income-based valuation method to annually test its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The fair value of the intangible asset is compared to its carrying value. This method uses the Company’s own market assumptions considered reasonable and inherent in the analysis. Any excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss.

No

impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets was required for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


, or


.

Other intangible assets with determinable lives primarily consist of customer intangibles, unpatented technologies, patents and trademarks. The other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 15 years.

Long-lived assets (including definite-lived intangible assets) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant sustained change in



DOVER CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

the business climate. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is produced and compared to its carrying value. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value, as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.

Restructuring Accruals

From time to time, the Company takes actions to reduce headcount, close facilities, or otherwise exit operations. Such restructuring activities at an operation are recorded when management has committed to an exit or reorganization plan and when termination benefits are probable and can be reasonably estimated based on circumstances at the time the restructuring plan is approved by management or when termination benefits are communicated. Exit costs include future minimum lease payments on vacated facilities and other contractual terminations. In addition, asset impairments may be recorded as a result of an approved restructuring plan. The accrual of both severance and exit costs requires the use of estimates. Though the Company believes that its estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different from the original estimated amounts.

Foreign Currency

Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries, where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have been translated at year-end exchange rates and profit and loss accounts have been translated using weighted-average monthly exchange rates. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Earnings as a component of Other comprehensive earnings (loss). Assets and liabilities of an entity that are denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency are re-measured into the functional currency using end of period exchange rates or historical rates, where applicable to certain balances. Gains and losses related to these re-measurements are recorded within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of Other expense (income), net. Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment in nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured and d) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. Service revenue represents less than 5% of total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed. In limited cases, revenue arrangements with customers require delivery, installation, testing, certification, or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized. The Company includes shipping costs billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in cost of goods and services.

Stock-Based Compensation

The principal awards issued under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans include non-qualified stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock units and performance share awards. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. At the time of grant, the Company estimates forfeitures, based on historical experience, in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest. The value of the portion of the award that is expected to ultimately vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis, generally over the explicit service period of

three years

(except for retirement-eligible employees and retirees) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Expense for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is recorded over the period from the date of grant through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service.

See Note 13 — Equity and Cash Incentive Program

for additional information related to the Company’s stock-based compensation.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes on continuing operations includes federal, state, local and non-U.S. taxes. Tax credits, primarily for research and experimentation, non-U.S. earnings and U.S. manufacturer's tax deduction are recognized as a reduction of the provision for income taxes on continuing operations in the year in which they are available for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences. Temporary differences include the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefit of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for which realization is not assured. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all available evidence, including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback periods, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income. The valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax regulations, interpretations and rulings, changes to enacted statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates.

Tax benefits are recognized from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents. Tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized on ultimate settlement.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”) was enacted, which significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Act also provided for a one-time deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits (“E&P”) through the year ended December 31, 2017. The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ("GILTI") provisions of the Tax Reform Act require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. The Company expects that it will be subject to incremental U.S. tax on GILTI income beginning in 2018, due to expense allocations required by the U.S. foreign tax credit rules. The Company has elected to account for GILTI tax in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore has not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. The Company has recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the benefit for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The final impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act. In accordance with SAB 118 the financial reporting impact of the Tax Reform Act will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018.

owned and leased property and any business interruptions that may occur due to an insured hazard affecting those properties, subject to reasonable deductibles and aggregate limits. The Company’s property and casualty insurance programs contain various deductibles that, based on the Company’s experience, are typical and customary for a company of its size and risk profile. The Company does not consider any of the deductibles to represent a material risk to the Company. The Company generally maintains deductibles for claims and liabilities related primarily to workers’ compensation, health and welfare claims, general commercial, product and automobile liability and property damage and business interruption resulting from certain events. The Company accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. As part of the Company’s risk management program, insurance is maintained to transfer risk beyond the level of self-retention and provide protection on both an individual claim and annual aggregate basis.

Reclassifications –

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

The following standards, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), will, or are expected to, result in a change in practice and/or have a financial impact to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements:

In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. This ASU provides new guidance about income statement classification and eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness. The entire change in fair value for qualifying hedge instruments included in the effectiveness will be recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and amounts deferred in OCI will be reclassified to earnings in the same income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged item is reported. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This ASU changes the income statement presentation of defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plan expense by requiring separation between operating expense (the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense) and non-operating expense (all other components of net periodic benefit expense, including interest cost, amortization of prior service cost, curtailments and settlements, etc.). The operating expense component is reported with similar compensation costs while the non-operating components are reported outside of operating income. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods for the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the definition of a business, which clarifies the definition of a business and assists entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. Under this guidance, when substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or group of similar assets), the assets acquired would not represent a business. In addition, in order to be considered a business, an acquisition would have to include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output. The amended guidance also narrows the definition of outputs by more closely aligning it with how outputs are described in FASB guidance for revenue recognition. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods for the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.



DOVER CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. This ASU also provides clarifications surrounding the presentation of the effects of leases in the income statement and statement of cash flows. This guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019.

During the second half of 2017, the Company developed a project plan to guide the implementation of ASU 2016-02. The Company made progress on this plan including surveying the Company’s businesses, assessing the Company’s portfolio of leases and compiling a central repository of active leases. The Company has also selected a lease accounting software solution to support the new reporting requirements and made progress on its configuration and the initial design of the future lease process.  While the Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting guidance will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company expects to recognize right of use assets and liabilities for its operating leases in the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The guidance introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled, in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018.

The Company commenced its assessment of ASU 2014-09 during the second half of 2015 and developed a project plan to guide the implementation. The Company has completed the project including analyzing the ASU’s impact on the Company's contract portfolio, surveying the Company's businesses and discussing the various revenue streams, completing contract reviews, comparing its historical accounting policies and practices to the requirements of the new guidance, identifying potential differences from applying the requirements of the new guidance to its contracts and updating and providing training on its accounting policy. The Company has completed the process of evaluating controls and new disclosure requirements and identifying and implementing appropriate changes to its business processes and systems to support recognition and disclosure under the new guidance. The Company will adopt this new guidance using the modified retrospective method that will result in a cumulative effect adjustment, as of the date of adoption. The Company’s adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The amended guidance simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by eliminating the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment charge will now be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The Company early adopted this guidance on January 1, 2017 as its annual impairment test is performed after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The ASU changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as the classification of related matters in the statement of cash flows. The adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits in the Company's provision for income taxes within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings rather than paid-in capital of

$8,365

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

. Additionally, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows now present excess tax benefits as an operating activity, adjusted prospectively. Finally, the Company elected to continue to estimate forfeitures based on historical data and recognizes forfeiture compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2017.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 340): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. Under this guidance, entities utilizing the first-in first-out ("FIFO") or average cost method should measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, whereas net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business,



DOVER CORPORATION

less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2017. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

2. Planned Spin-off of Certain Energy Businesses

On December 7, 2017, Dover announced that its Board of Directors had approved a plan to spin-off its upstream energy businesses within the Dover Energy segment, collectively, the “Wellsite” business, through a U.S. tax-free spin-off to shareholders. The Company expects to complete the separation in May of 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions. The Company incurred

$15,300

of costs associated with the transaction which were reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. These transaction costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, legal and information system functions. Upon separation, the historical results of

Wellsite

will be presented as discontinued operations as it represents a strategic shift in operations with a material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

The changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable operating segments were as follows:

During


and


, the Company recognized additions of

$35,233

and

$908,313

, respectively, to goodwill as a result of acquisitions as discussed in

Note 3 — Acquisitions

. Due to the inherent difficulty of estimating the initial purchase price allocation of recent acquisitions and the time needed to finalize the balance sheets of acquired companies, the Company will continue to refine its estimates of fair value to more accurately allocate purchase price; any such revisions are not expected to be significant. During


and


, the Company recorded adjustments totaling

$(29,113)

and

$5,991

, respectively, as a result of the finalization of purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to acquisitions completed in


and


.

During


and


, the Company derecognized

$79,409

and

$34,867

, respectively, of goodwill as a result of the disposition of businesses as discussed in

Note 4 — Disposed and Discontinued Operations

. The Company allocated goodwill upon disposal based upon the fair value of the disposed business relative to the remaining entities in its reporting unit.

Annual impairment testing

The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred.  In the first quarter of 2017, the Company re-aligned its reporting units after acquiring four companies in the retail fueling market in 2016, increasing its reporting units from

nine

to

ten

. The Company performed the goodwill impairment test for the three reporting units within the Fluids segment before and after the realignment, concluding that the fair values of the reporting units were in excess of their carrying values.

The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2017 using a discounted cash flow analysis as discussed in

Note 1 — Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

. The Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for each of its

ten

reporting units, concluding that the fair values of all of its reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values.  As previously noted, the fair values of each of the Company’s reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis which includes management’s current assumptions as to future cash flows and long-term growth rates. The discount rates used in these analyses varied by reporting unit and were based on a capital asset pricing model and published relevant industry rates. The Company used discount rates commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent to each reporting unit and in our internally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in the


reporting unit valuations ranged from

8.5%

to

10.0%

.

While the Company believes the assumptions used in the 2017 impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results, if market conditions worsen or persist for an extended period of time, an impairment of goodwill or assets may occur.

10. Borrowings and Lines of Credit

Borrowings consist of the following:

(1)

Carrying amount is net of unamortized debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs. Total unamortized debt discounts were

$17.6 million

and

$18.8 million

as of

December 31, 2017

, and

December 31, 2016

, respectively. Total deferred debt issuance costs were

$14.9 million

and

$16.5 million

as of

December 31, 2017

, and

December 31, 2016

, respectively.

The discounts are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the issuances.

On March 15, 2018, the outstanding 5.45% notes with a principal value of

$350.0 million

will mature.  These notes have been classified as a current maturity of long-term debt as of

December 31, 2017

.

On November 9, 2016, the Company issued

€600 million

of 1.25% euro-denominated notes due 2026. The proceeds of

$656.4 million

from the sale of the notes, net of discounts and issuance costs, were used for payment of a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of Wayne.

The Company maintains a

$1.0 billion

five-year unsecured committed revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks which expires on

November 10, 2020

.

At the Company's election, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin.

In addition,

the Credit Agreement requires the Company to pay a facility fee and imposes various restrictions on the Company such as, among other things, the requirement for the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1

. The Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement and other long-term debt covenants at

December 31, 2017

and had a coverage ratio of

11.4 to 1.0

. The Company primarily uses this facility as liquidity back-up for its commercial paper program and has not drawn down any loans under the facility and does not anticipate doing so. The Company generally uses commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, funding of acquisitions and the repurchases of its common stock.

Letters of Credit

As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company had approximately

$135.4 million

outstanding in letters of credit and guarantees with financial institutions, which expire at various dates in


through


. These letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance, warranty and other performance obligations. In general, the Company would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of its obligations, the probability of which is believed to be remote.

As of

December 31, 2017

, the future maturities of long-term debt were as follows:

11. Financial Instruments

Derivatives

The Company is exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of its operations. In order to manage this risk the Company has hedged portions of its forecasted sales and purchases, which occur within the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with currency forward or collar contracts designated as cash flow hedges. At

December 31, 2017

and


, the Company had contracts with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts of

$115,580

and

$59,932

, respectively, to exchange foreign currencies, principally the Pound Sterling, Chinese Yuan, Swedish Krona, Euro, Canadian Dollar, and Swiss Franc. The Company believes it is probable that all forecasted cash flow transactions will occur.

In addition, the Company had outstanding contracts at

December 31, 2017

and


with a total notional amount of

$59,952

and

$56,189

, respectively, that are not designated as hedging instruments. These instruments are used to reduce the Company's exposure to operating receivables and payables that are denominated in non-functional currencies. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The following table sets forth the fair values of derivative instruments held by the Company as of

December 31, 2017

and


and the balance sheet lines in which they are recorded:

For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Other comprehensive earnings (loss), net of tax as a separate component of the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and is reclassified into Cost of goods and services in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. The amount of gains or losses from hedging activity recorded in earnings is not significant and the amount of unrealized gains and losses from cash flow hedges, which are expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months, is not significant; therefore, additional tabular disclosures are not presented. There are no amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and the Company's derivative instruments that are subject to credit risk contingent features were not significant.



DOVER CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as the Company’s policy is to contract with highly-rated, diversified counterparties.

The Company has designated the

€300,000

and

€600,000

of euro-denominated notes issued December 4, 2013 and November 9, 2016, respectively, as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in euro-denominated operations. Changes in the value of the euro-denominated debt are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments within Other comprehensive earnings (loss) of the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Earnings to offset changes in the value of the net investment in euro-denominated operations. Additionally, the Company's floating-to-floating cross currency swap agreement in exchange for Swiss Francs matured on October 15, 2015, and was also designated as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations. Changes in the value of the euro-denominated debt and the Swiss Franc cross-currency swap, resulting from exchange rate differences are offset by changes in the net investment due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged.

Amounts recognized in Other comprehensive earnings (loss) for the gains (losses) on its net investment hedges were as follows:

Fair Value Measurements

Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  A financial instrument’s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value as follows:

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 inputs include inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of assets or liabilities.

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

The Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2017

and


were as follows:

The derivative contracts are measured at fair value using models based on observable market inputs such as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; therefore, they are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.



DOVER CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

In addition to fair value disclosure requirements related to financial instruments carried at fair value, accounting standards require disclosures regarding the fair value of all of the Company’s financial instruments. The estimated fair value of long-term debt at

December 31, 2017

and


was

$3,324,776

and

$3,534,553

, respectively, compared to the carrying value of

$2,986,702

and

$3,206,637

, respectively. The estimated fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments and is, therefore, classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable and notes payable are reasonable estimates of their fair values as of

December 31, 2017

and


due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to future deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

As of December 31,


, the Company had non-U.S loss carryforwards of

$963.6 million

primarily resulting from restructuring undertaken to effect the Knowles spin-off and non-operating activities. The entire balance of the non-U.S. losses as of

December 31, 2017

is available to be carried forward, with

$129.2 million

of these losses beginning to expire during the years


through


. The remaining

$834.4 million

of such losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

The Company has

$82.4 million

and

$84.2 million

of state tax loss carryforwards as of December 31,


and


, respectively that are available for use by the Company between


and


.

The Company maintains valuation allowances by jurisdiction against the deferred tax assets related to certain of these carryforwards as utilization of these tax benefits is not assured for certain jurisdictions.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was enacted which permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax liabilities as of December 31,


and recognized a provisional tax benefit of

$172.0 million

. The Tax Reform Act also imposed a tax for a one-time deemed repatriation of post-1986 unremitted foreign E&P through the year ended December 31,


. The Company recorded provisional tax expense related to the deemed repatriation of

$115.0 million

payable over eight years. The Company plans to make cash distributions to the U.S from non-U.S. subsidiaries of up to an estimated

$450.0 million

, and consequently has recorded

$11.0 million

of anticipated local withholding tax expense associated with these planned distributions. The GILTI provisions of the Tax Reform Act require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. The Company expects that it will be subject to incremental U.S. tax on GILTI income beginning in 2018, due to expense allocations required by the U.S. foreign tax credit rules. The Company has elected to account for GILTI tax in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore has not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118 to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. In accordance with the SAB 118 guidance, the Company has recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the benefit for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The final impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, issuance of additional regulatory guidance, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act. In accordance with SAB 118 the financial reporting impact of the Tax Reform Act will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

The Company files U.S., federal, state, local and foreign tax returns. The Company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions, and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. This decrease may result in an income tax benefit. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of

zero

to

$14.1 million

. The Company is no longer subject to examinations of its federal income tax returns for prior years through 2013. All significant state, local and international matters have been concluded for prior years through 2012. The Company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties.

The following table is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits:

(1)

The settlement of certain income tax examinations of 2011 and 2012 tax years (in the year ended December 31, 2015) resulted in a significant decrease in unrecognized tax benefits.

(2)

If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the Company’s effective tax rate is

$59.2 million

. During the years ended December 31,


,


and


, the Company recorded expense (income) of

$(0.5) million

,

$0.7 million

and

$(4.3) million

, respectively, as a component of provision for income taxes related to the accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of

$16.5 million

at December 31,


and

$14.6 million

at December 31,

13. Equity and Cash Incentive Program

The Company's share-based awards are typically granted annually at its regularly scheduled first quarter Compensation Committee meeting. Beginning in 2013, these awards were made pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2012 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the "2012 Plan"), which was approved by shareholders on May 3, 2012. This plan replaced the 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan"), which would have otherwise terminated according to its terms on January 31, 2015 and the 1996 Non-Employee Directors Stock Compensation Plan (the "Directors Plan"), which would have otherwise terminated according to its terms on December 31, 2012. Upon adoption of the 2012 Plan, no additional awards could be granted under the 2005 Plan. Officers and other key employees, as well as non-employee directors, are eligible to participate in the 2012 Plan, which has a ten-year term and will terminate on May 3, 2022. The 2012 Plan provides for stock options and SARs grants, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance share awards, cash performance awards, directors' shares and deferred stock units. Under the 2012 Plan, a total of

17,000,000

shares of common stock are reserved for issuance, subject to adjustments resulting from stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations and other similar changes.

The exercise price per share for SARs is equal to the closing price of the Company’s stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. New common shares are issued when SARs are exercised. The period during which SARs are exercisable is fixed by the Company’s Compensation Committee at the time of grant. Generally, the SARs vest after

three

years of service and expire at the end of

ten

years.

Stock-based compensation costs are reported within Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The following table summarizes the Company’s compensation expense relating to all stock-based incentive plans:

On January 1, 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation: Stock Compensation (Topic 718).

See Note 1 — Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

. The adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits in the Company's provision for income taxes within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings rather than paid-in capital of

$8,365

for the year-ended

December 31, 2017

. The Company recognized net tax benefits of

$4,964

and

$661

during


and


, respectively, for the exercise of SARs, stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards. These benefits have been recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital and are reflected as financing cash inflows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

SARs

In


,


and


, the Company issued SARs covering

1,028,116

,

1,346,354

and

1,144,529

shares, respectively. Since 2006, the Company has only issued SARs and does not anticipate issuing stock options in the future. The fair value of each SAR grant was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

Expected volatilities are based on Dover's stock price history, including implied volatilities from traded options on Dover stock.   The Company uses historical data to estimate SAR exercise and employee termination patterns within the valuation model. The expected life of SARs granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the awards is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Performance Share Awards

Performance share awards granted are expensed over the three-year requisite performance and service period. Awards become vested if (1) the Company achieves certain specified internal metrics and (2) the employee remains continuously employed by the Company during the performance period. Partial vesting may occur after separation from service in the case of certain terminations not for cause and for retirements.

The performance share awards granted in these years are considered performance condition awards as attainment is based on Dover's performance relative to established internal metrics. The fair value of these awards was determined using Dover's closing stock price on the date of grant. The expected attainment of the internal metrics for these awards is analyzed each reporting period, and the related expense is adjusted up or down based on expected attainment, if that attainment differs from previous estimates. The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in attainment is recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.

Guarantees

The Company has provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets, including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. The Company does not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and is not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities.

Product Recall

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company determined that there was a quality issue with a product component part in the Fluids segment and voluntarily reported this issue to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”). During the first quarter of 2017, the Company announced a voluntary recall of the product in collaboration with the CPSC. At December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a warranty accrual of

$23,150

in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to cover the estimated costs of the recall. At

December 31, 2017

, the warranty accrual was

$6,613

and was included in Other accrued expenses. The reduction in the warranty accrual was due to settlements made of

$9,337

and a reduction of

Litigation

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible parties.” In each instance, the extent of the Company’s liability appears to be relatively insignificant in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other “potentially responsible parties” involved and is anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition,

The Company and some of its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses. These proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of use of the Company’s products, exposure to hazardous substances, patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. Management and legal counsel, at least quarterly, review the probable outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred and currently accrued to-date. The Company has reserves for other legal matters that are probable and estimable, and at

While it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal actions, in the opinion of management, based on the aforementioned reviews, the Company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

15. Employee Benefit Plans

The Company offers defined contribution retirement plans which cover the majority of its U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries. The Company’s expense relating to defined contribution plans was

The Company sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and employee compensation. The Company also provides to certain management employees, through non-qualified plans, supplemental retirement benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law.

In July 2013, the Company announced that, after December 31, 2013, the U.S. qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans would be closed to new employees. All pension-eligible employees as of December 31, 2013 will continue to earn a pension benefit through December 31, 2023 as long as they remain employed by an operating company participating in the impacted plans. The Company also announced that effective January 1, 2024, the plans would be frozen to any future benefit accruals.

The Company also maintains other post-retirement benefit plans which cover approximately


participants, approximately


of whom are eligible for medical benefits. These plans are closed to new entrants. The supplemental and other post-retirement benefit plans are supported by the general assets of the Company.

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

Amounts expected to be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) into net periodic benefit cost during


are as follows:

Assumptions

The Company determines actuarial assumptions on an annual basis. The weighted average assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations were as follows:

(1)   In 2017, the medical plan in Brazil was amended which resulted in elimination of the benefit obligation. Thus, the 2017 post-retirement benefit discount rate does not reflect the plan in Brazil which had a higher discount rate than other plans.

The weighted average assumptions used in determining the net periodic benefit cost were as follows:

The Company’s discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit payment streams. The plans’ expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates.

For other post-retirement benefit measurement purposes, a

3.50%

annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits (i.e., health care cost trend rates) was assumed for


. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to

2.30%

by the year


and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate assumption can have an effect on the amounts reported. For example, increasing (decreasing) the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase (decrease) the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligation as of December 31,


by

$105

and

$(105)

, respectively, and would have a negligible impact on the net post-retirement benefit cost for


.

Plan Assets

The primary financial objective of the plans is to secure participant retirement benefits. Accordingly, the key objective in the plans’ financial management is to promote stability and, to the extent appropriate, growth in the funded status. Related and supporting financial objectives are established in conjunction with a review of current and projected plan financial requirements.

As it relates to the funded defined benefit pension plans, the Company’s funding policy is consistent with the funding requirements of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") and applicable international laws. The Company is responsible

for overseeing the management of the investments of the plans’ assets and otherwise ensuring that the plans’ investment programs are in compliance with ERISA, other relevant legislation and related plan documents.

The investment managers, in implementing their investment processes, have the authority and responsibility to select appropriate investments in the asset classes specified by the terms of their applicable prospectus or investment manager agreements with the plans.

The assets of the plans are invested to achieve an appropriate return for the plans consistent with a prudent level of risk. The asset return objective is to achieve, as a minimum over time, the passively managed return earned by market index funds, weighted in the proportions outlined by the asset class exposures identified in the plans’ strategic allocation. The expected return on assets assumption used for pension expense is developed through analysis of historical market returns, statistical analysis, current market conditions and the past experience of plan asset investments. Overall, it is projected that the investment of plan assets within Dover’s U.S. defined benefit plan will achieve a net return over time from the asset allocation strategy of

7.25%

.

The Company’s actual and target weighted average asset allocation for our U.S. Corporate Pension Plan was as follows:

While the non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country, the long-term objectives are generally the same as for the U.S. pension assets. The Company's non-U.S. plans were expected to achieve rates of return on invested assets of

4.73%

in


,

4.95%

in


and

4.85%

in


.

The fair values of both U.S. and non-U.S. pension plan assets by asset category within the fair value hierarchy (as defined in

Note 11 — Financial Instruments

) were as follows:

* In accordance with Fair Value Measurement Topic 820 (Subtopic 820-10), certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient were not classified in the fair value hierarchy. These are included to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the aggregate pension plan assets.

** Revisions were made to the fair value leveling hierarchies in the above tables as of December 31, 2016. The non-U.S. changes were from

(i): level 3 to levels 2 and 1 and (ii): level 2 to level 1 and investments measured at net asset value. The U.S. change was from level 1 to investments measured at net asset value. The valuation techniques were unchanged and the amounts revised were not material to the prior annual period.

The Company had no level 3 U.S. Plan assets at

December 31, 2017

DOVER CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

Common stocks represent investments in domestic and foreign equities, which are publicly traded on active exchanges and are valued based on quoted market prices.

Fixed income investments include U.S. Treasury bonds and notes, which are valued based on quoted market prices, as well as investments in other government and municipal securities and corporate bonds, which are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.

Mutual funds are categorized as either Level 1, 2 or Net Asset Value (the "NAV") as a practical expedient depending on the nature of the observable inputs. Collective trusts and real estate investment funds are valued using NAV as a practical expedient as of the last business day of the year. The NAV is based on the underlying value of the assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. The value of the underlying assets is based on quoted prices in active markets.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The availability of observable data is monitored by plan management to assess appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. Depending upon the availability of such inputs, specific securities may transfer between levels. In such instances, the transfer is reported at the end of the reporting period.

17. Segment Information

The Company's businesses are aligned around its key end markets to better focus on growth strategies, provide increased opportunities to leverage Dover's scale and capitalize on productivity initiatives. Operating segments are defined as the components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and regularly evaluated by the entity's chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making resource allocation decisions and evaluating performance. Based on this guidance, the Company has

four

operating segments, which are also its reportable segments, as follows:

•

The Engineered Systems segment is comprised of two platforms, Printing & Identification and Industrials, and is focused on the design, manufacture and service of critical equipment, consumables and components serving the fast-moving consumer goods, digital textile printing, vehicle service, environmental solutions and industrials end markets.

•

The Fluids segment, serving the Fueling & Transport, Pumps and Hygienic & Pharma end markets, is focused on the safe handling of critical fluids across the retail fueling, chemical, hygienic, oil and gas and industrial end markets. In the first quarter of 2017, we aligned our financial reporting around these key end markets to provide more detailed information after acquiring four companies in the retail fueling market in 2016.

•

The Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energy efficient equipment and systems serving the commercial Refrigeration and Food Equipment end markets.

•

The Energy segment, serving the Drilling & Production, Bearings & Compression and Automation end markets, is a provider of customer-driven solutions and services for safe and efficient production and processing of fuels worldwide and has a strong presence in the bearings and compression components and automation markets.

ITEM 9.   CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31,


to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Controls

During the fourth quarter of


, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;

(ii)

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and

(iii)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management’s report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9B.   OTHER INFORMATION

Under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, we are required to disclose in our periodic reports if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain Iran-related entities or individuals designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders.  Disclosure is required even where the activities are authorized by and in compliance with applicable law.  In connection with the easing of certain sanctions by the U.S. against Iran in January 2016 and in compliance with the economic sanctions regulations administered by U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), a wholly-owned non-U.S. subsidiary in our Fluids



segment serving the pumps end market sold non-U.S. origin spare parts related to the oil, gas and/or petrochemical sectors to Iranian counterparties pursuant to new contracts, which resulted in revenue of approximately €101,660 and net profits of approximately €71,536 in 2017 (expected total revenue from these contracts is approximately €12.1 million).  The sales were made pursuant to, and in compliance with, the terms and conditions of OFAC’s General License H.  Our non-U.S. subsidiary intends to continue doing business in Iran under General License H in compliance with U.S. economic sanctions laws; any such sales may require disclosure in future periodic reports pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.
