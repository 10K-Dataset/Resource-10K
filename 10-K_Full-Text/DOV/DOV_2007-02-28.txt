PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Dover Corporation (“Dover” or the
    “Company”), incorporated in 1947 in the State of
    Delaware, became a publicly traded company in 1955. It is a
    diversified industrial manufacturing corporation encompassing
    operating companies that manufacture a broad range of
    specialized industrial products and components as well as
    sophisticated manufacturing equipment, and seek to expand their
    range of related services, consumables and wear parts sales.
    Additional information is contained in Items 7 and 8.

The Company reports its results in six reportable business
    segments — Diversified, Electronics, Industries,
    Resources, Systems and Technologies, and discusses their
    operations in 13 groups, which are each comprised of two or more
    business units. Diversified builds products for use in the
    defense, aerospace and automotive aftermarket industries, heat
    transfer equipment, specialized bearings, construction and
    agricultural cabs, as well as color measurement and control
    systems for printing presses. Electronics designs and
    manufactures a wide variety of electronic and electromechanical
    components for original equipment manufacturers
    (“OEMs”) serving numerous end markets including
    hearing aids, telecom infrastructure and cell phones, defense
    and aerospace electronics, and medical/life sciences. In
    addition, this segment manufactures ATM hardware and software
    for retail applications and financial institutions, and chemical
    proportioning and dispensing systems for janitorial/sanitation
    applications. Industries produces equipment and components for
    use in waste handling, bulk transport and automotive service
    industries. Resources manufactures products primarily for the
    petroleum and natural gas, automotive fueling, fluid handling,
    engineered components, material handling and chemical equipment
    industries. Systems manufactures refrigeration systems, display
    cases, walk in coolers, food service cooking equipment and other
    products for the supermarket/restaurant industries. In addition,
    this segment manufactures specialized machinery for use in the
    beverage and food processing industries. Technologies builds
    sophisticated automated imaging and testing equipment for the
    electronics industry, and industrial printers and consumables
    for coding and marking.

Business
    Strategy

The Company operates with certain fundamental strategies. First,
    it seeks to acquire and own businesses with proprietary,
    engineered industrial products which make them leaders in the
    niche markets they serve. To ensure success, Dover companies
    place emphasis on new product development to better serve
    customers and expansion into new markets to serve new customers.
    Second, it expects these businesses to be committed to
    operational excellence and all of Dover’s operating
    companies are expected to be market leaders as measured by
    market share, customer service, innovation, profitability and
    return on invested capital. Third, the Company is committed to a
    highly autonomous operating culture with high ethical standards,
    trust, respect and open communication, to allow individual
    growth and operational effectiveness.

Management
    Philosophy

The Company practices a highly decentralized management style.
    The presidents of the operating companies, within the 13 groups,
    are given a great deal of autonomy and have a high level of
    independent responsibility for their businesses and their
    performance. This is in keeping with the Company’s
    operating philosophy that independent operations are better able
    to serve customers by focusing closely on their products and
    markets, and reacting quickly to customer needs. The
    Company’s executive management role is to provide
    management oversight, allocate and manage capital, assist in
    major acquisitions, evaluate, motivate and, as necessary,
    replace operating company management, and also provide selected
    other services.

Acquisitions

Dover has a long-standing acquisition program that seeks to
    acquire and develop “platform” businesses that are
    market leaders as measured by market share, customer service,
    innovation, profitability and return on invested capital. Ideal
    acquisition candidates are generally manufacturers of high
    value-added, engineered products sold to a broad customer base
    of industrial or commercial users. One of the most critical
    factors in the decision to acquire a



business is the Company’s judgment of the skill, energy,
    ethics and compatibility of the top executives at the
    acquisition target. In keeping with the Company’s
    decentralized structure, Dover generally expects that acquired
    companies will continue to be operated by the management team in
    place at acquisition, with a high degree of autonomy. During the
    period from 2004 through 2006, the Company significantly
    increased the level of acquisition spending, buying 25
    businesses with an aggregate cost of $2,709.0 million.
    Annualized revenue of these companies were $1,600.0 million
    as of their date of acquisition with projected annualized
    operating margins in the range of 15%. Dover also changed its
    focus towards acquiring fewer larger businesses with better
    growth characteristics.

The Company has traditionally focused on acquiring new
    businesses that can operate independently from other Dover
    companies (“stand-alones”). Beginning in 1993, the
    Company began increasing the number of “add-on”
    businesses it acquired — businesses that could be
    added on to existing Dover companies. In recent years, including
    2006, the Company has indicated an intention to buy larger
    stand-alones, while continuing to acquire “add-on”
    businesses to enhance companies already owned.

In 2004, the Company acquired eight add-on businesses for an
    aggregate cost of $502.5 million. During 2005, the Company
    acquired a total of ten businesses (eight add-ons) for an
    aggregate cost of $1,089.7 million. In 2006, Dover acquired
    seven companies (five add-ons) for an aggregate cost of
    $1,116.8 million, the highest annual acquisition investment
    level in its history.

For more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past
    two years, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8. The Company’s future growth
    depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful
    businesses, as a substantial number of the Company’s
    current businesses operate in relatively mature markets. While
    the Company expects all of its businesses to generate annual
    organic growth of 5 — 7% over a business cycle,
    sustained organic growth at these levels is difficult to achieve
    consistently each year.

Divestitures

While the Company generally expects to hold businesses that it
    buys, it periodically reassesses its portfolio of businesses to
    verify that those businesses continue to be essential
    contributors to Dover’s long-term growth strategy. The
    Company will strategically divest operations that cannot meet
    Dover’s long-term performance goals. In addition, on
    occasion, there are situations in which one of Dover’s
    companies is a very attractive acquisition for another company
    based on specific market conditions. In those circumstances,
    Dover might make an opportunistic sale. Based on these criteria,
    the Company has over the past six years discontinued 38 and sold
    32 operations for an aggregate pre-tax consideration of
    approximately $1,066 million.

In 2005, the Company announced a formal portfolio review, which
    was substantially completed in 2006, resulting in the
    discontinuance of 20 businesses, of which 14 were sold by
    December 31, 2006. These actions have resulted in aggregate
    pretax consideration of $605.2 million received for the
    businesses sold, which had annualized revenue of approximately
    $1,055 million with approximately 5% operating margins.
    This process has improved the Company’s focus on key
    markets for long-term growth.

For more details, see the “Discontinued Operations”
    discussion below and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8.

Reportable
    Segments

The Company reports its results in six segments and discusses
    their operations in 13 groups. The segment structure is
    primarily based on markets served and allows the management of
    each segment to focus its attention on particular markets, to
    provide oversight capacity to acquire additional businesses and
    to foster leadership development. Below is a listing of each
    segment and the descriptions of each group therein. For
    additional financial information about Dover’s reportable

    applications, consumer electronics, space, telecommunications,
    medical systems, and aircraft.

Product
    Identification

The Product Identification group (“PI”) is a worldwide
    supplier of industrial marking and coding systems. Its primary
    printing products are used for marking variable information
    (such as date codes or serial numbers) on consumer products. It
    provides a broad array of printing technologies, including
    Continuous Ink Jet (“CIJ”), Thermal Transfer Overprint
    (“TTO”), Direct Thermal, laser and Drop on Demand
    (“DOD”). PI provides solutions for product marking on
    primary packaging, secondary packaging such as cartons, and
    pallet marking for use in warehouse logistics operations. PI
    also manufactures bar code printers and portable printers used
    where on demand labels/receipts are required . The markets
    served by PI include food, beverage, cosmetics, pharmaceutical,
    electronics, automotive and other markets where variable marking
    is required.

The Technologies segment has operations and manufacturing
    facilities in North America, Europe and Asia and sales
    operations globally.

Discontinued
    Operations

Companies that are considered discontinued operations in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” are presented
    separately in the consolidated statements of operations, balance
    sheets, and cash flows and are not included in continuing
    operations. Earnings from discontinued operations include
    charges, when necessary, to reduce these businesses to estimated
    fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is determined by using
    quoted market prices, when available, or other accepted
    valuation techniques. All interim and full year reporting
    periods presented reflect the discontinued operations discussed
    below on a comparable basis. Please refer to Note 8 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for additional information.

Raw
    Materials

Dover’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw
    materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished
    components, which are generally available from a number of
    sources. As a result, shortages or the loss of any single
    supplier have not had, and are not likely to have, a material
    impact on operating profits. In 2004, there



were meaningful increases in raw material costs, particularly
    steel, and higher energy costs, including an estimated increase
    in unrecovered steel costs of approximately $35 million.
    These increases primarily affected the Company’s industrial
    segments. In 2005 and 2006, the impact of commodity prices
    moderated and the operating companies have been able to
    substantially offset cost increases with surcharges and price
    increases over time.

Research
    and Development

Dover’s operating companies are encouraged to develop new
    products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to
    satisfy customer needs, expand revenue opportunities
    domestically and internationally, maintain or extend competitive
    advantages, improve product reliability and reduce production
    costs. During 2006, $155.0 million was spent on research
    and development, including qualified engineering costs, compared
    with $149.6 million and $133.8 million in 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

For the Technologies and Electronics companies, efforts in these
    areas tend to be particularly significant because the rate of
    product development by their customers is often quite high.
    Electronics companies developing specialty electronic components
    for the life sciences, datacom and telecom commercial markets
    believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product
    performance improvement and reduced costs. The result has been
    that product life cycles in these markets generally average less
    than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that
    time period.

Dover’s other segments contain many businesses that are
    also involved in important product improvement initiatives.
    These businesses also concentrate on working closely with
    customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and
    market applications, and continuously improving manufacturing
    processes. Most of these businesses experience a much more
    moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is
    generally experienced by the Technologies and Electronics
    businesses.

Intellectual
    Property and Intangible Assets

Dover companies own many patents, trademarks, licenses and other
    forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over a
    number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various
    times over a number of years. A large portion of the Dover
    companies’ intellectual property consists of patents,
    unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting
    trade secrets that the companies seek to protect in various
    ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and
    suppliers where appropriate. In addition, a significant portion
    of the Company’s intangible assets relate to customer
    relationships. While the Dover companies’ intellectual
    property and customer relationships are important to their
    success, the loss or expiration of any of these rights or
    relationships, or any groups of related rights or relationships,
    would not materially affect the Company on a consolidated basis.
    The Company believes that its companies’ commitment to
    continuous engineering improvements, new product development and
    improved manufacturing techniques, as well as strong sales,
    marketing and service efforts, are significant to their general
    leadership position in the niche markets that they serve.

Seasonality

In general, operations of the Dover companies, while not
    seasonal, tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third
    quarters, particularly companies serving the consumer
    electronics, transportation, construction, waste hauling,
    petroleum, commercial refrigeration and food service markets.
    Companies serving the major equipment markets, such as power
    generation, chemical and processing industries, tend to have
    long lead times geared to seasonal, commercial or consumer
    demands, and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and
    delivery to coincide with those market trends.

Customers

Dover’s companies serve thousands of customers, no one of
    which accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s
    consolidated revenue in 2006. One customer within the Systems
    segment accounted for approximately 20% of Systems revenue
    during 2006. Within each of the other five segments, no customer
    accounted for more than 10% of that segment’s revenue in
    2006.



The Components group within the Electronics segment serves the
    military, space, aerospace, commercial and datacom/telecom
    infrastructure markets. Its customers include some of the
    largest operators in these markets. In addition, many of the OEM
    customers of the Components group outsource their manufacturing
    to Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”)
    companies. Customers of the A&M group within the
    Technologies segment also include many of the largest global EMS
    companies, particularly some of the newer EMS companies in
    China, and major printed circuit board and semi-conductor
    manufacturers.

In the other Dover segments, customer concentrations are quite
    varied. Companies supplying the hearing aid, cell phone,
    telecom, automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend
    to deal with a few large customers that are significant within
    those industries. This also tends to be true for companies
    supplying the power generation, aerospace and chemical
    industries. In the other markets served, there is usually a much
    lower concentration of customers, particularly where the
    companies provide a substantial number of products and services
    applicable to a broad range of end use applications.

Backlog

Backlog generally is not a significant long-term success factor
    in most of Dover’s businesses, as most of the products of
    Dover companies have relatively short

order-to-delivery

periods. It is more relevant to those businesses that produce
    larger and more sophisticated machines or have long-term
    government contracts, primarily in the Diversified segment, as
    well as the Mobile Equipment group within the Industries
    segment, the A&M group within the Technologies segment and
    the Components group within the Electronics segment. Total
    Company backlog as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was
    $1,341.0 million and $1,111.5 million, respectively.

Competition

Dover’s competitive environment is complex because of the
    wide diversity of the products its companies manufacture and the
    markets they serve. In general, most Dover companies are market
    leaders, which compete with only a few companies and the key
    competitive factors are customer service, product quality and
    innovation. Dover usually is a more significant competitor
    domestically, where its principal markets are, than in foreign
    markets; however, Dover companies are becoming increasingly
    global where greater competition exists.

In the Technologies segment, Dover companies compete globally
    against a variety of companies, primarily operating in Europe
    and the Far East.

Within the other segments, competition is primarily domestic,
    although an increasing number of Dover companies see more
    international competitors in the markets that they serve,
    particularly certain companies in the Electronics, Systems,
    Resources and Diversified segments.

International

For foreign revenue, including exports, and an allocation of the
    assets of the Company’s continuing operations, see
    Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Although international operations are subject to certain risks,
    such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and foreign
    governmental restrictions, Dover intends to increase its
    expansion into foreign markets, including South America, Asia
    and Eastern Europe.

The countries where most of Dover’s foreign subsidiaries
    and affiliates are based are France, Germany, the U.K., the
    Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and, with increased emphasis,
    Malaysia and China.

Environmental
    Matters

Dover believes its operations generally are in substantial
    compliance with applicable regulations. In a few instances,
    particular plants and businesses have been the subject of
    administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies
    or private parties relating to the discharge or potential
    discharge of regulated substances. Where necessary, these
    matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to
    achieve compliance. Dover



believes that continued compliance will not have a material
    impact on the Company’s financial position and will not
    require significant expenditures or adjustments to reserves.

Employees

The Company had approximately 33,000 employees in continuing
    operations as of December 31, 2006.

    the report is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    The information on the Company’s Internet website is not
    incorporated into this

Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Dover’s business, financial condition, operating results
    and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including
    but not limited to those set forth below, any one of which could
    cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results
    or from anticipated future results. For a discussion identifying
    additional risk factors and important factors that could cause
    actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see
    the discussion in “SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING
    FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Cyclical
    Economic Conditions May Affect the Company’s Financial
    Performance

A meaningful portion of the Company’s revenue, most notably
    those from the A&M group in the Technologies segment and the
    Components group in the Electronics segment, is derived from
    companies which serve the global electronics markets, that are
    subject to somewhat unpredictable short-term business cycles. As
    a result, the revenue and operating performance of these
    companies in any one period are not necessarily predictive of
    their revenue and operating performance in other periods, and
    could have a material impact on Dover’s consolidated
    financial position.

The Oil and Gas group in the Resources segment has a certain
    level of risk related to the volatility of energy prices
    although overall demand is more directly related to depletion
    rates and rig counts.

In addition, Dover is subject to substantially the same risk
    factors as other

U.S.-based

industrial manufacturers. However, except as noted above, the
    structure of Dover and the many different markets its companies
    serve mitigate the possibility that any of these risk factors
    will materially impact Dover’s consolidated financial
    position.

The facilities are generally well maintained and suitable for

    selective increases in capacity for a few businesses
    experiencing strong growth demands.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal
    proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites
    identified under Federal and State statutes which provide for
    the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible
    parties.” In each instance, the extent of the
    Company’s liability appears to be very small in relation to
    the total projected expenditures and the number of other
    “potentially responsible parties” involved and is
    anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few
    of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing
    remedial activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with
    regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been
    established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are and from time to
    time may be parties to a number of other legal proceedings
    incidental to their businesses. These proceedings primarily
    involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of
    use of products of Dover companies, exposure to hazardous
    substances or patent infringement, litigation and administrative
    proceedings involving employment matters, and commercial
    disputes. Management and legal counsel periodically review the
    probable outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses
    reasonably expected to be incurred, the availability and extent
    of insurance coverage, and established reserves. While it is not
    possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions or any
    need for additional reserves, in the opinion of management,
    based on these reviews, it is very unlikely that the disposition
    of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive
    position.

(1)  FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Management assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its
    ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and
    financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity
    are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital
    expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, adequacy of
    available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the
    ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.
    The Company generates substantial cash from operations and
    remains in a strong financial position, with enough liquidity
    available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic
    acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a short and
    long-term basis.

The following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements
    of Cash Flows:

Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2006
    increased $308.5 million over the prior period primarily
    reflecting higher earnings and margins from continuing
    operations before depreciation and amortization and lower tax
    payments.

Cash used in investing activities during 2006 decreased
    $202.5 million compared to 2005, reflecting essentially
    flat acquisition spending, higher proceeds from the disposition
    of businesses in the 2006 period, partially offset by an
    increase in capital expenditures, primarily in the
    oil & gas and micro-acoustics businesses. Acquisition
    expenditures in 2006 were $1,116.8 million compared to
    $1,089.7 million in 2005 while proceeds from the
    disposition of businesses increased $286.6 million over
    2005 to $445.9 million. Capital expenditures of
    $194.7 million, which increased $64.2 million over the
    prior year, primarily funded investments in plant expansions,
    plant machinery and information systems. The Company currently
    anticipates that any acquisitions made during 2007 will be
    funded from available cash and internally generated funds and,
    if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper,
    established lines of credit or public debt markets. Capital
    expenditures for 2007 are expected to be consistent with 2006
    levels.

Cash provided by financing activities during 2006 decreased
    $146.3 million when compared to 2005. Acquisitions during
    2006 were primarily funded through cash from operations and
    proceeds generated from dispositions. In addition, the Company
    repurchased $48.3 million of treasury shares and paid
    dividends of $144.8 million.

Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure; calculated as
    accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable)
    increased from December 31, 2005 by $262.5 million,
    primarily as a result of acquisitions, foreign exchange
    translation and the Company’s organic growth. Excluding the
    impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, working capital
    would have increased by $41.3 million from
    December 31, 2005. Average Annual Adjusted



Working Capital as a percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure;
    calculated as the five quarter average balance of accounts
    receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable divided by the
    trailing twelve months of revenue) decreased to 18.9% from 20.7%
    at year end 2005 and inventory turns improved to 6.5 turns from
    5.7 turns in the prior year.

In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage
    based upon the operating, investing and financing
    classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flow, the Company also measures free cash flow (a non-GAAP
    measure). Management believes that free cash flow is an
    important measure of operating performance because it provides
    both management and investors a measurement of cash generated
    from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay
    dividends, repay debt and repurchase Dover’s common stock.
    For further information, see Non-GAAP Disclosures at the
    end of this Item 7.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
    $684.1 million or 10.5% of revenue compared to
    $440.0 million or 8.2% of revenue in the prior year. The
    2006 increase in free cash flow reflected higher earnings and
    margins from continuing operations before depreciation and
    amortization, and lower tax payments, partially offset by higher
    capital expenditures. The following table is a reconciliation of
    free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities.

At December 31, 2006, the Company’s net property,
    plant, and equipment totaled $856.8 million compared to
    $706.7 million at the end of 2005. The increase in net
    property, plant and equipment reflected acquisitions of
    $83.7 million, capital expenditures of $194.7 million,
    partially offset by decreases related to foreign currency
    fluctuation of $21.9 million, and depreciation.

The aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities decreased from a $307.5 million net liability
    at the beginning of the year to a net liability of
    $298.3 million at year-end 2006. This resulted primarily
    from decreases in current tax liabilities, increases in deferred
    tax assets from accruals, a decrease in deferred tax liabilities
    as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 (see
    below) and net operating loss carryforwards (primarily
    acquisition related), partially offset by an increase in
    deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets.

Dover’s consolidated benefit obligation related to defined
    and supplemental retirement benefits increased by
    $52.0 million in 2006. The increase was due principally to
    net obligations of $50.5 million related to acquisitions.
    Offsetting this increase was a plan asset increase of
    $37.6 million due to gains on plan investments during the
    year and Company contributions of $3.0 million, which were
    partially offset by benefit payouts. During 2006, plan
    amendments, primarily from union negotiated contracts, created
    an increase in the benefit obligation of $8.5 million. Due
    to the decrease in the net funded status of the plans and the
    increase in the amortization of unrecognized losses, it is
    estimated that pension expense will increase from
    $42.8 million to approximately $45.2 million in 2007.
    Effective December 31, 2006 Dover adopted
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”). See
    notes 2 & 13 in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for additional information on the adoption of this standard.



The Company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization
    calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess its overall financial
    leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to
    investors for the same reason. The following table provides a

Net debt at December 31, 2006 remained relatively flat as
    increased cash flow from operations and cash generated from
    dispositions were used to fund Dover’s acquisition
    program. The percentage decrease in net debt to total capital,
    after record acquisition spending, reflects strong operational
    free cash flow and the proceeds from dispositions of
    $445.9 million.

Dover’s long-term debt instruments had a book value of
    $1,512.8 million on December 31, 2006 and a fair value
    of approximately $1,502.9 million. On December 31,
    2005, the Company’s long-term debt instruments had a book
    value of $1,345.4 million and a fair value of approximately
    $1,406.0 million.

The Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are
    adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable
    risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future.
    Acquisition spending could potentially increase Company debt.
    However, management anticipates that the debt to capital ratio
    will remain generally consistent with historical levels.
    Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected
    to satisfy the Company’s various cash flow requirements,
    including acquisitions and capital expenditures.

Management is not aware of any potential impairment to the
    Company’s liquidity, and the Company is in compliance with
    all of its long-term debt covenants. It is anticipated that in
    2007 any funding requirements above cash generated from
    operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper
    or, depending upon market conditions, through the issuance of
    long-term debt or some combination of the two.

As of December 31, 2006, there were two interest rate swap
    agreements outstanding for a total notional amount of
    $100.0 million, designated as fair value hedges on part of
    the Company’s $150.0 million 6.25% Notes due on
    June 1, 2008. One $50 million interest rate swap
    exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest. The
    other $50 million swap is designated in foreign currency
    and exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest,
    and also hedges a portion of the Company’s net investment
    in foreign operations. The swap agreements have reduced the
    effective interest rate on the notes to 5.78%. There is no hedge
    ineffectiveness, and the fair value of the interest rate swaps
    outstanding as of December 31, 2006 was determined through
    market quotation.

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company closed a
    structured five-year, non-interest bearing, $165.1 million
    amortizing loan with a non-US lender which also included a
    participation fee received by the Company of $9.9 million.
    The loan was recorded at face value. The Company also expects to
    incur a total of $5.7 million in debt related issuance
    costs. Beginning in April 2007, the repayment schedule requires
    payments every April and September with the final payment to be
    made in July 2011. The participation fee will be amortized
    ratably into Other Expense (Income), Net over the term of the
    loan and is recorded in Other Deferrals in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. The loan agreement includes a put and call
    provision that can be exercised starting in June 2008 though the
    end of the loan term.



At December 31, 2006, the Company had open foreign exchange
    forward purchase contracts expiring through March 2007 related
    to fair value hedges of foreign currency exposures as follows:

(2)  RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS:

    COMPARED TO 2005

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 22%
    over 2005, due to increases at all six segments led by increases
    of $322.6 million at Resources and $334.6 million at
    Electronics. Resources revenue increased due to positive market
    fundamentals, acquisitions and improved operating efficiencies
    while Electronics’ revenue increased due to acquisitions
    and strong organic growth. Overall, Dover’s organic revenue
    growth was 14%, acquisition growth was 8% and the impact from
    foreign exchange was negligible. Gross profit increased 25% to
    $2,348.0 million from 2005 while the gross profit margin
    increased 80 basis points to 36.1%.

Selling and administrative expenses of $1,436.2 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 increased
    $224.8 million over the comparable 2005 period, primarily
    due to increased revenue activity and $26.4 million of
    equity compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standard 123(R), “Share Based
    Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which
    required companies to expense the fair value of equity
    compensation, such as stock options and stock-settled stock
    appreciation rights (“SSARs”), primarily over the
    related vesting period. The Company used the modified
    prospective method to adopt SFAS No. 123(R), which did



not require the restatement of prior periods. Selling and
    administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to
    22.1% from 22.7% in 2005. Excluding the effect of
    SFAS No. 123(R), selling and administrative expenses
    during the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been
    $1,409.8 million or 21.7% of revenue.

Interest expense, net, increased 6.6% to $77.0 million for
    2006, compared to $72.2 million for 2005 due to higher
    average outstanding borrowings and average commercial paper
    rates.

Other (Income) Expense, net for 2006 of $12.0 million was
    driven primarily by foreign exchange losses. Other (Income)
    Expense, net of ($12.3) million for 2005 included foreign
    exchange gains of $7.5 million.

The 2006 tax rate for continuing operations was 26.7%,
    reflecting the effect of the full year retroactive extension of
    the U.S. federal research credit, a favorable mix of
    foreign earnings in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions, a lower
    relative U.S. federal tax exclusion for foreign sales in
    2006 and the inclusion of a $7.8 million net benefit
    primarily related to the resolution of a state income tax issue.
    The 2005 tax rate for continuing operations of 26.5% included a
    $9.5 million provision related to the repatriation of
    $373.7 million of dividends and a $25.5 million
    benefit primarily related to the resolution of U.S. tax
    issues and a $5.5 million benefit related to a favorable
    federal tax court decision. Excluding the repatriation
    provision, the full year 2005 tax rate for continuing operations
    was 24.9%.

Earnings from continuing operations for 2006 were
    $822.9 million or $2.94 per diluted share compared to
    $607.3 million or $2.19 per diluted share. For 2006,
    net earnings were $561.8 million, or $2.73 per diluted
    share, which included a $41.5 million, or $0.20 per
    diluted share, loss from discontinued operations, compared to
    $510.1 million, or $2.50 per diluted share for 2005,
    which included $63.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted
    share, in earnings from discontinued operations. Refer to
    Note 8 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for

Diversified’s revenue and earnings increases were primarily
    due to growth in the Process Equipment group. Operating margin
    decreased 50 basis points as the impact of the revenue
    growth was offset by softness in markets served by the
    Industrial Equipment group. Backlog reached a record high on a
    6% increase in bookings for the year.

Industrial Equipment revenue was up 3% over the prior year,
    mainly due to the commercial aerospace market. Earnings
    decreased 6%, as the leverage on increased revenue was offset by
    softness in light construction and agricultural markets, the
    cost of productivity initiatives, higher material costs, and
    lower margin aerospace revenue. Bookings decreased 5% and
    backlog increased 2% over the prior year.

Process Equipment group’s revenue increased 18% over the
    prior year due to robust heat exchanger and energy markets.
    Improved pricing and productivity partially offset by weak
    demand for print control systems contributed to the 25% earnings
    growth over the prior year. Bookings and backlog increased 28%

The increases in revenue and earnings at Electronics compared to
    the prior year were due to the third quarter 2005 acquisitions
    of Knowles Electronics and Colder Products and significant
    organic revenue growth of 21% for the year due to strength in
    the core Components businesses.

Components revenue increased 81%, while operating earnings
    increased 187% compared to the prior year, as a result of the
    Knowles and Colder acquisitions and strong organic growth,
    particularly in the frequency controls and micro acoustics
    markets. Acquisitions accounted for 52% and 63% of the revenue
    and earnings growth, respectively. Bookings and backlog
    increased 72% and 7%, respectively, when compared to the prior
    year.

Commercial equipment revenue increased 9% while earnings
    decreased 8%, due to weakness in the ATM business. Bookings

Industries’ revenue and earnings increases over the prior
    year were the result of improvements in the Mobile Equipment
    group which experienced strong energy, military, and commercial
    transportation markets in 2006. Operating margin increased
    140 basis points largely due to operating efficiencies and
    positive leverage in the refuse and trailer markets.

Mobile Equipment revenue increased 13% over the prior year,
    driven for the most part by strength in the commercial
    transportation market. Earnings increased 29% driven by volume
    and improved leverage. In addition, prior year earnings were
    positively impacted by a gain of approximately $1 million
    on the sale of a facility. Bookings and backlog increased 20%
    and 37%, respectively.

Revenue in the Service Equipment group declined 3% compared to
    the prior year reflecting weakness in the North American
    automotive service industry. Earnings increased by 2% compared
    to the prior year. Bookings and backlog decreased 5% and 7%,

Resources’ revenue, earnings, and bookings increases were
    primarily the result of improvements in the Oil and Gas
    Equipment group and the August 30, 2006 acquisition of
    Paladin. Margin remained flat as it was impacted by purchase
    accounting amortization related to the Paladin acquisition.
    Overall, the segment had organic revenue growth of 13% during
    the year, with the remainder primarily from acquisitions.

Oil and Gas Equipment delivered strong results throughout 2006
    with revenue and earnings increases of 37% and 52%,
    respectively, over the prior year. Commodity pricing for oil and
    gas began moderating in the second quarter of 2006, however,
    strong activity in exploration, production and drilling
    continued to drive the positive 2006 results. The group
    continues to add capacity judiciously to meet increasing levels
    of demand. Bookings increased by 37% and backlog increased 72%
    when compared to the prior year.

Fluid Solutions revenue and earnings increased 8% and 3%,
    respectively, when compared to the prior year. The revenue
    increase was due to improvements in mobile transport equipment,
    global demand for retail petroleum equipment and support
    equipment for the growing ethanol business. Product mix had a
    negative impact on earnings and margin. Bookings increased 9%
    and backlog increased 27% when compared to the prior year.

Material Handling revenue increased 20% while earnings increased
    13% compared to the prior year . The revenue increase was
    primarily due to the Paladin acquisition and continued growth in
    the heavy winch business, partially offset by softness in the
    automotive and recreational vehicle markets. Margin was impacted
    by the weak automotive, light construction and recreational
    vehicle markets. Bookings increased 19% while the backlog grew
    39% when compared to the prior year.

Systems’ increases in revenue and earnings over the prior
    year were driven by improvements at all businesses in the
    segment. The decrease in operating margin was due to the Food
    Equipment group which more than offset increases by Packaging
    Equipment.

Food Equipment revenue and earnings increased 19% and 13%,
    respectively, over the prior year due to positive market demand
    for both supermarket and foodservice equipment. The margin
    decrease reflects increased commodity costs and temporary cost
    inefficiencies related to higher production levels in the food
    equipment business. Bookings increased 15% compared to the prior
    year, while backlog increased 5%.



Packaging Equipment revenue and earnings increased 15% and 19%,
    respectively, over the prior year, as a result of increases in
    both can necking equipment and packaging closure systems.
    Bookings remained flat while backlog increased 1%.

Technologies’ revenue and earnings increases over the prior
    year reflect the relative strength of the segment’s markets
    during 2006. The segment achieved strong organic growth of 19%,
    with the remainder mainly from acquisitions as improvements were
    reported in both groups in the segment.

Automation and Measurement revenue increased 33% and earnings
    increased 97% when compared to the prior year. Although the
    semiconductor market moderated in the fourth quarter of 2006,
    the group continued to exhibit strong fundamentals based on
    levels of recurring revenue and the overall strength of the
    consumer electronics industry. Bookings increased 26% and
    backlog increased 2% compared to the prior year.

Product Identification (“PI”) revenue increased 21%
    and earnings increased 37% over the prior year, reflecting
    successful results from all product lines and regions as well as
    the impact of the Markem and O’Neil acquisitions which
    contributed 12% to the group’s revenue growth for the year.
    Bookings increased 18% and backlog increased 64%.

    COMPARED WITH 2004

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased
    19.1% or $853.9 from 2004, primarily driven by increases at all
    six segments led by $278.7 million at Resources and
    $142.2 million at Electronics. Resources’ revenue
    increased due to positive market fundamentals, acquisitions and
    improved operating efficiencies. Electronics’ revenue was
    impacted by the acquisition of two significant Components
    companies in the third quarter of 2005 along with operating
    improvements in the core businesses. Overall, Dover’s
    organic revenue growth was 10%, acquisition growth was 9%, and
    the foreign exchange impact was negligible. Gross profit
    increased 17.3% to $1,878.7 million, while gross profit
    margin of 35.2% decreased 50 basis points.

Selling and administrative expenses for 2005 were
    $1,211.5 million, or 22.7% of revenue, compared to
    $1,053.1 million or 23.5% of revenue in 2004. The increase
    in selling and administrative expenses included increases in
    compensation and pension benefits along with the impact of the
    2005 acquisitions. Operating earnings of $667.2 million for
    2005 increased $119.1 million compared to the prior year
    due primarily to the 19.1% increase in revenue, benefits from
    improved operating efficiencies and improved global economic
    conditions. Operating margin for 2005 increased 30 basis
    points to 12.5%.

Net interest expense increased 18.1% to $72.2 million for
    2005, compared to $61.1 million for 2004, primarily due to
    the increase in net interest expense from higher outstanding
    borrowings used to fund 2005 acquisitions.

Other (Income) Expense, net for 2005 of ($12.3) million was
    driven primarily by foreign exchange gains. Other (Income)
    Expense, net of ($5.1) million for 2004 included favorable
    settlements and miscellaneous credits of $11.8 million,
    which were largely offset by foreign exchange losses of
    $6.7 million.



The 2005 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 26.5%
    compared to 26.4% in 2004 and included a $9.5 million
    U.S. tax provision related to the repatriation of
    $373.7 million of dividends, a $25.5 million benefit
    primarily related to the resolution of U.S. tax issues, and
    a $5.5 million first quarter benefit related to a favorable
    federal tax court decision. Excluding the repatriation
    provision, the full year 2005 effective tax rate for continuing
    operations was 24.9%.

Earnings from continuing operations for 2005 were
    $446.2 million or $2.19 per diluted share compared to
    $362.4 million or $1.77 per diluted share in 2004. For
    2005, net earnings were $510.1 million or $2.50 per
    diluted share, which included $63.9 million or
    $0.31 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued
    operations, compared to $412.8 million or $2.02 per
    diluted share for 2004, which included $50.3 million or
    $0.25 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued
    operations. Refer to Note 8 in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information on discontinued operations.

Diversified’s revenue and earnings increases were driven by
    both the Industrial Equipment Group and the Process Equipment
    Group due to growth in the aerospace, defense, heat exchanger,
    and oil and gas markets.

Industrial Equipment’s revenue and earnings increased 29%
    and 19%, respectively, over the prior year. The revenue increase
    was driven primarily by strength in the aerospace and
    construction markets. The margin decrease resulted from
    unfavorable product mix and acquisition-related costs, partially
    offset by volume increases and moderating raw material pricing.
    The automotive and powersports business was down as gains from
    the North American professional racing market were not enough to
    offset a weak powersports market. Bookings increased 26% and
    backlog increased 25%.

Process Equipment’s full-year revenue and earnings rose 19%
    and 33%, respectively, and margin grew to over 15%, reflecting
    double digit revenue growth in all areas, and significant
    earnings and margin growth in the oil and gas market for
    bearings. In addition, overall growth was driven by the
    expanding HVAC markets for heat exchangers, as well as
    productivity gains. Bookings increased 20% and backlog grew 30%.

The increases in both revenue and earnings at Electronics were
    primarily driven by the acquisition of two significant
    Components companies, Knowles Electronics and Colder Products,
    in the third quarter of 2005 and



operating improvements within core businesses, although these
    gains were partially offset by decreases in Commercial Equipment
    and purchase accounting amortization.

Components operating earnings increased 207% in 2005 compared to
    the prior year on a 57% increase in revenue, reflecting the
    acquisitions, and revenue and earnings growth in almost all of
    the other Components businesses. The margin grew to exceed 12%
    and was aided by the two acquisitions and included
    $5.3 million of integration costs related to a 2004 Vectron
    acquisition. Bookings increased 65% and backlog grew 89%.

Commercial Equipment full year revenue was flat, with earnings
    down 23% and a substantial decrease in margin, reflecting some
    market softness and the effect of Hurricane Katrina, which
    disrupted the ATM operations significantly in the third quarter
    of 2005. Bookings decreased 2% and backlog grew 23%.

Revenue and earnings increases in Industries were driven
    primarily by the Mobile Equipment group, due to strong military
    sales and strength in environmental markets. Industries’
    earnings increase was partially offset by a decrease at the
    Service Equipment group. Bookings and backlog both exceeded
    prior-year levels on improved strength in the environmental and
    military markets.

Strong military sales and strength in the oil field industry
    contributed to Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings increases
    of 15% and 41%, respectively, with significant margin
    improvement. Earnings were also positively impacted by a gain of
    approximately $1 million on the sale of a facility and cost
    control initiatives. Bookings increased 14% driven by strong
    demand for trailer and refuse products and backlog increased 15%.

Service Equipment revenue and margin were flat while earnings
    declined moderately, reflecting overall end market conditions
    and weakness in the automotive service industry. Earnings were
    negatively impacted by product mix, new product introduction
    costs, and a facility shutdown. Bookings were essentially flat,
    while backlog increased 18%.

In 2005, Resources had record revenue, earnings, margin,
    bookings and backlog, reflecting positive market fundamentals,
    acquisitions and improved operating efficiencies.



Oil and Gas Equipment led the segment in 2005 with increases in
    revenue and earnings of 52% and 62%, respectively, due to
    continued robust demand for its energy-related products.
    Bookings increased by 49% and backlog increased 58%.

Fluid Solutions revenue and earnings increased 12% and 16%,
    respectively, due to strong refining, petrochemical, and
    transportation markets, partially offset by weakness in the
    retail petroleum markets. Bookings were up 11%, and backlog was
    up 10%.

Material Handling realized an increase in revenue of 14% while
    earnings, which included strategic realignment costs at one of
    the businesses, grew 6%. The increase in revenue was driven by
    demand in the construction, crane, aerial lift, petroleum, and
    military markets, partially offset by slow demand from the
    automotive industry. Bookings were up 11% and backlog was up 20%.

Systems revenue and earnings increases were driven by both Food
    Equipment and Packaging Equipment, reflecting strength in the
    supermarket equipment and can machinery markets.

Food Equipment revenue increased 14% in 2005 compared to the
    prior year, due to higher supermarket and foodservice equipment
    sales, resulting in an earnings increase of 42%. Margin improved
    due to volume leverage, pricing initiatives and productivity
    gains. Bookings increased 13% and backlog was up 26%.

Packaging Equipment revenue and earnings in 2005 increased 13%
    and 18%, respectively, over the prior year and margin rose
    80 bps due to strength in the can machinery market,
    particularly in Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East, driven
    by both new lines and can size conversions. The package closure
    business experienced continued weak market conditions in Western
    Europe, particularly Germany. Bookings increased 22% and backlog

Revenue and earnings increases in 2005 reflected strength in the
    product identification market, offset by costs of
    $8 million related to restructuring charges that are
    expected to have a positive impact on the segment’s future
    financial performance.

A&M revenue was essentially flat and earnings declined 25%
    in 2005 compared to the prior year, reflecting restructuring
    charges of approximately $6 million, principally related to
    certain facility closures, and general sales



declines, except at the screen printer rework equipment
    companies. Bookings increased 9% and backlog increased 59%.

PI reported a revenue increase of 41%, while earnings increased
    30%. The revenue and earnings increases were primarily
    attributable to the impact of the Datamax acquisition at the end
    of 2004, partially offset by approximately $2 million of
    restructuring costs, weakness in printing equipment markets and
    price competitiveness for marking equipment. Bookings increased
    41% and backlog increased 3%.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The Company’s consolidated financial statements and related
    public financial information are based on the application of
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates,
    assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of
    accounting principles that have an impact on the assets,
    liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These
    estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in
    the public disclosures of the Company, including information
    regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The
    Company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting
    assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied.
    Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on
    a consistent basis throughout the Company. Primary areas where
    the financial information of Dover is subject to the use of
    estimates, assumptions and the application of judgment include
    the following areas:

•

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances
    are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, b) price is fixed or determinable,
    c) collectibility is reasonably assured, and
    d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where
    installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the
    installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of
    the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving
    non-essential installation obligations are those which can
    generally be completed in a short period of time at
    insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these
    installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases
    can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the
    installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the
    delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until
    installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined
    that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the
    Company will allocate consideration received to the separate
    deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize
    revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable
    identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other
    post shipment obligations such as training and customer
    acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is
    deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance
    has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned
    when services are performed.

•

Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual
    operating companies based on estimates of losses related to
    customer receivable balances. Estimates are developed by using
    standard quantitative measures based on historical losses,
    adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases,
    evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The
    establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and
    assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable
    balances. Due to the fact that Dover operates in many different
    markets, changes in economic conditions in specific markets
    generally should not have a material effect on reserve balances
    required.

•

Inventory for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries,
    including all international subsidiaries and the Technologies
    segment, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is
    stated at cost, determined on the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under
    certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the
    valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly
    value inventory. Technologies companies tend to experience
    higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly
    given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over
    relatively short periods of time.

•

Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves
    at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting
    principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs,
    require the use of estimates. Though Dover believes that these
    estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual
    results may be different than the estimated amounts.



•

Dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its
    balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles
    related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of
    these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and
    amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of
    estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established
    accounting guidelines (including
    SFAS No. 142) for impairment also requires
    significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it
    relates to the identification of reporting units and the
    determination of fair market value. Dover’s assets and
    reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an
    annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of
    impairment exist. The Company believes that its use of estimates
    and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally
    accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions
    could potentially require adjustments to the valuations.

•

The valuation of Dover’s pension and other post-retirement
    plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are
    used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and
    assets/liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates,
    investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and
    mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in Dover’s
    pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with
    external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for
    Dover’s future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions
    and future investment returns could potentially have a material
    impact on Dover’s pension expenses and related funding
    requirements. Dover’s expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns,
    economic trends and portfolio allocation. Dover’s discount
    rate assumption is determined by constructing a portfolio of
    bonds to match the expected benefit stream to be paid from the
    Company’s pension plans. The benefit payment stream is
    assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities, as well
    as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio.

•

Dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are
    reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets
    are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income
    streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are
    also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and
    international issues that are currently unresolved. The Company
    routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and
    believes that it is properly reserved. Valuations related to tax
    accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting
    regulations, changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in
    statutory tax rates, and the Company’s future taxable
    income levels.

•

Dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk
    management program. These accruals require the use of estimates
    and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate
    liability. The Company estimates losses under these programs
    using actuarial assumptions, Dover’s experience, and
    relevant industry data. Dover considers the current level of
    accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market
    conditions and Company experience.

•

Dover has established reserves for environmental and legal
    contingencies at both the operating company and corporate
    levels. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is
    required to quantify Dover’s ultimate exposure in these
    matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed
    on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to
    assure that Dover is properly reserved. Reserve balances are
    adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing
    issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging
    issues. While Dover believes that the current level of reserves
    is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these
    determinations.

•

The Company from time to time will discontinue certain
    operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if
    necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations
    to their estimated fair value less costs to sell. These
    estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds
    anticipated as a result of the sale. The adjustments to fair
    market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain
    or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the
    inability to sell an operation could potentially require future
    adjustments to these estimates.

•

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate
    the fair value of SSARs and stock options that are granted to
    employees. The model requires management to estimate the
    expected life of the SSAR or option and the volatility of
    Dover’s stock using historical data. For additional
    information related to the assumptions used, see Note 10 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.



New
    Accounting Standards

Effective January, 1 2006, Dover adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment.” See
    Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for additional information on the adoption of this standard.

Effective December 31, 2006, Dover adopted
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”). See
    Notes 2 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for additional information on the adoption of this standard.

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the way
    companies are to account for uncertainty in income tax reporting
    and filing and prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for recognizing, derecognizing, and
    measuring the tax benefits of a tax position taken, or expected
    to be taken, on a tax return. Any change in net assets as a
    result of adopting the new standard is required to be recorded
    as a cumulative effect adjustment to Dover’s opening
    retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2007. The
    adoption of FIN 48 is not expected to have a material
    impact on the Company’s retained earnings balance as of
    January 1, 2007.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering
    the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current year Financial Statements”
    (“SAB 108”), which provides interpretive guidance
    on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements
    in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a
    materiality assessment. SAB 108 is effective as of the end
    of Dover’s 2006 fiscal year, allowing a one-time
    transitional cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained
    earnings as of January 1, 2006 for errors that were not
    previously deemed material, but are material under the guidance
    in SAB 108. The adoption of SAB 108 as of
    December 31, 2006 had no impact on Dover’s financial
    statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”
    (“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
    accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. This statement is effective for
    fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2007 and does
    not require any new fair value measurements. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its
    overall results of operations or financial position.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”
    (“SFAS No. 154”), which replaces APB
    No. 20 “Accounting Changes,” and
    SFAS No. 3 “Reporting Accounting Changes in
    Interim Financial Statements.” SFAS No. 154
    changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of
    a change in accounting principle, and applies to all voluntary
    changes in accounting principles, as well as changes required by
    an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that it does
    not include specific transition provisions. Specifically,
    SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to
    prior periods’ financial statements, unless it is
    impracticable to determine the period-specific effects or the
    cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 does not
    change the transition provisions of any existing pronouncement.
    SFAS No. 154 is effective for Dover for all accounting
    changes and corrections of errors made beginning January 1,
    2006 and had no impact on Dover.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
    “Inventory Costs, An Amendment of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4”
    (“SFAS No. 151”). SFAS No. 151
    requires that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage
    costs be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when
    incurred. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 were
    applicable to inventory costs incurred beginning January 1,
    2006. The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 151 was
    immaterial to Dover’s consolidated results of operations,
    cash flows or financial position.

Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information
    regarding the Company’s results as determined by GAAP, the
    Company also discloses non-GAAP information which management
    believes provides useful information to investors. Free cash
    flow, net debt, total capitalization, operational working
    capital, revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not
    financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a
    substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or
    equity, revenue



and working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP and
    they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported
    by other companies. Management believes the net debt to total
    capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures
    of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to total
    capitalization is helpful in evaluating the Company’s
    capital structure and the amount of leverage it employs. Free
    cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement
    of cash generated from operations that is available to fund
    acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase
    Dover’s common stock. Reconciliations of free cash flow and
    net debt can be found above in this Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Management believes
    that reporting operational working capital (also sometimes
    called “adjusted working capital”), which is
    calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts
    payable, provides a meaningful measure of the Company’s
    operational results by showing the changes caused solely by
    revenue. In addition, management believes that reporting
    operational working capital and revenue at constant currency,
    which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful
    measure of the Company’s operational changes, given the
    global nature of Dover’s businesses. Management also
    believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes
    the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions,
    provides a useful comparison of the Company’s revenue
    performance and trends between periods.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rates

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in
    interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of long-term
    fixed interest rate debt, interest rate swaps attached thereto,
    commercial paper borrowings and investments in cash equivalents.
    Generally, the fair market value of fixed-interest rate debt
    will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest
    rates rise. A 59 basis point increase or decrease in interest
    rates (10% of the Company’s weighted average long-term debt
    interest rate) would have an immaterial effect on the fair value
    of the Company’s long-term debt. Commercial paper
    borrowings are at variable interest rates, and have maturities
    of three months or less. A 53 basis point increase or
    decrease in the interest rates (10% of the Company’s
    weighted average commercial paper interest rate) on commercial
    paper borrowings would have an immaterial impact on the
    Company’s pre-tax earnings. All highly liquid investments,
    including highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
    original maturity of three months or less, are considered cash
    equivalents. The Company places its investments in cash
    equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limits the
    amount of exposure to any one issuer. A 51 basis point
    decrease or increase in interest rates (10% of the
    Company’s weighted average interest rate) would have an
    immaterial impact on the Company’s pre-tax income. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company had two interest rate swaps
    outstanding, as discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. The Company does not enter into derivative
    financial or derivative commodity instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes.

Foreign
    Exchange

The Company conducts business in various foreign countries,
    primarily in Canada, Mexico, substantially all of the European
    countries, Brazil, Argentina, Malaysia, China and other Asian
    countries. Therefore, changes in the value of the currencies of
    these countries affect the Company’s financial position and
    cash flows when translated into U.S. Dollars. The Company
    has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements
    relative to its investment in foreign operations. The Company
    may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into fair
    value hedges. Certain individual operating companies that have
    foreign exchange exposure have established formal policies to
    mitigate risk in this area by using fair value

and/or

cash
    flow hedging. The Company has mitigated and will continue to
    mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of
    decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority
    of all costs are local-currency based. A change of 10% or less
    in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material
    effect on the Company’s financial position and cash flows.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on its assessment under the criteria set forth in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

,
    management concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles.

In making its assessment of internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, management has excluded
    those companies acquired in purchase business combinations
    during 2006, which included Infocash/Cash Services Limited, Cash
    Point Machines PLC, O’Neil Product Development, Paladin
    Brands Holding Inc., Environ Holdings, Markem Corp., and Magnum
    Systems Inc. These companies are wholly-owned by the Company and
    their total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006
    represents approximately 3% of the Company’s consolidated
    total revenue for the same period and their assets represent
    approximately 18% of the Company’s consolidated assets as
    of December 31, 2006.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Dover Corporation:

We have completed integrated audits of Dover Corporation’s
    consolidated financial statements and of its internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our
    audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement
    schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15 (a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Dover
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects,
    the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
    the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
    statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
    We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
    audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for share-based compensation and defined benefit pension and
    other postretirement obligations in 2006.

Internal
    control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting,” appearing under Item 8, that the
    Company maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
    Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management
    is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
    of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
    control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
    the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
    performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance



with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
    and expenditures of the company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
    regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
    acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
    that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report of Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Infocash/Cash
    Services Limited, Cash Point Machines PLC, O’Neil Product
    Development, Paladin Brands Holding Inc., Environ Holdings,
    Markem Corp., and Magnum Systems Inc. from its assessments of
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 because they were acquired by the Company
    in purchase business combinations during 2006. These companies
    are wholly owned by the Company and their total revenue and
    assets represent approximately 3% and 18% of the Company’s
    consolidated total revenue and assets, respectively, as
    reflected in its financial statements for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Description
    of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description
    of Business

Dover Corporation (“Dover” or the “Company”)
    is a diversified, multinational manufacturing corporation
    comprised of stand-alone operating companies which manufacture a
    broad range of specialized industrial products and components.
    The Company also provides engineering, testing and other
    services, which are not significant in relation to consolidated
    revenue. Dover’s operating companies are based primarily in
    the United States of America and Europe with manufacturing and
    other operations throughout the world. The Company reports its
    results in six segments, Diversified, Electronics, Industries,
    Resources, Systems and Technologies, and discusses its
    operations in 13 groups. For additional information on
    Dover’s segments, see Note 14.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
    The results of operations of purchased businesses are included
    from the dates of acquisitions. The assets, liabilities, results
    of operations and cash flows of all discontinued operations have
    been separately reported as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented. Certain amounts in prior years have been
    reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include
    allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, net realizable
    value of inventories, restructuring charges, valuation of
    goodwill, pension and post retirement assumptions, useful lives
    associated with amortization and depreciation of intangibles and
    fixed assets, warranty reserves, income taxes and tax valuation
    reserves, environmental reserves, legal reserves, insurance
    reserves and the valuations of discontinued assets and
    liabilities.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits
    and short-term investments which are highly liquid in nature and
    have original maturities at the time of purchase of three months
    or less.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable is composed principally of trade accounts
    receivable that arise primarily from the sale of goods or
    services on account and are stated at historical cost.
    Management at each operating company evaluates accounts
    receivable to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that
    will not be collected in the future and records the appropriate
    provision. The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a
    charge to operating expense and reduces accounts receivable. The
    estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based primarily on
    management’s evaluation of the aging of the accounts
    receivable balance, the financial condition of its customers,
    historical trends, and time outstanding of specific balances.
    Actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from
    management’s estimates due to changes in future economic,
    industry or customers’ financial conditions.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade
    receivables, accounts payable, notes payable and accrued
    expenses approximates fair value due to the short maturity of
    these instruments.



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories

Inventories for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries,
    including all international subsidiaries and the Technologies
    segment, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is
    stated at cost, determined on the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment includes the cost of land,
    buildings, equipment and significant improvements to existing
    plant and equipment. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and
    minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When property or
    equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and
    accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts
    and the gain or loss realized on disposition is reflected in
    earnings. Depreciation expense was $132.6 million in 2006,
    $113.1 million in 2005, and $108.4 million in 2004 and
    was calculated on a straight-line basis for all periods
    presented.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company periodically enters into fair value and cash flow
    hedge transactions specifically to hedge its exposures to
    various items, including but not limited to interest rate and
    foreign exchange rate risk. The Company does not enter into
    derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and
    does not have a material portfolio of derivative financial
    instruments.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” and related amendments
    and interpretations, the Company recognizes all derivatives as
    either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures
    those instruments at fair value. If the derivative is designated
    as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair
    value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to
    the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period.
    If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portions of changes in the fair value of the
    derivative are recorded in other comprehensive earnings and are
    recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item
    affects income. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair
    value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

Tests for hedge ineffectiveness are conducted periodically and
    any ineffectiveness found is recognized in the statement of
    operations. The fair market value of all outstanding
    transactions is recorded in the Other assets and deferred
    charges, or Other deferrals section of the balance sheet, as
    applicable. The corresponding change in value of the hedged
    assets/liabilities is recorded directly in that section of the
    balance sheet.

During 2006, the Company entered into derivative contracts to
    hedge potential foreign currency exposure on current assets and
    liabilities. The contracts were designated as fair value hedges
    and were considered by management to be highly effective. The
    derivative foreign exchange contracts settled during 2006 and
    resulted in a gain of approximately $0.6 million, which is
    recognized in Revenue and Other (income) Expense, net.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had open foreign exchange
    forward purchase contracts, expiring through March, 2007,
    related to fair value hedges of foreign currency exposures, as
    follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses
    over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,” the Company does not amortize goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Instead, these assets
    are tested for impairment annually unless indicators of
    impairment exist during the interim periods. For 2006 and 2005,
    the Company identified 16 reporting units for testing purposes.
    Step one of the test compared the fair value of the reporting
    unit (using a discounted cash flow method) to its book value.
    Step two, which compares the book value of the goodwill to its
    implied fair value, was not necessary since there were no
    indicators of potential impairment from step one. For
    information related to the amount of the Company’s goodwill
    by segment and intangible asset classes, see Note 7.

Long-Lived
    Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” long
    -lived assets (including intangible assets that are amortized)
    are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. If an indicator of impairment exists for any
    grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash
    flows is produced and compared to its carrying value. If an
    asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the
    excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value
    as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.

Foreign
    Currency

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the
    functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have been
    translated at year-end exchange rates and profit and loss
    accounts have been translated using weighted average yearly
    exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from translation have been
    recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as
    cumulative translation adjustments. Assets and liabilities of an
    entity that are denominated in currencies other than an
    entity’s functional currency are remeasured into the
    functional currency using end of period exchange rates or
    historical rates where applicable to certain balances. Gains and
    losses related to these remeasurements are recorded within the
    Statement of Operations as a component of “Other (income)
    expense, net.”

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances
    are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, b) price is fixed or determinable,
    c) collectibility is reasonably assured, and
    d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where
    installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the
    installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of
    the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving
    non-essential installation obligations are those which can
    generally be completed in a short period of time at
    insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these
    installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases
    can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the
    installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the
    delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until
    installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined
    that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the
    Company will allocate consideration received to the separate
    deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize
    revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable
    identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other
    post-shipment obligations such as training and customer
    acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is
    deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance
    has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned
    when services are performed and is not significant to any period
    presented.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Prior to 2006, Dover accounted for stock-based compensation in
    accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
    Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,” and followed the disclosure only provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation.” Accordingly, no compensation expense was



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recognized in the Company’s 2005 and 2004 Statement of
    Operations in connection with stock-based compensation granted
    to employees.

Effective January, 1 2006, Dover adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standard No. 123(R), “Share Based
    Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”) which no
    longer permits the use of the intrinsic value method under APB
    No. 25. The Company used the modified prospective method to
    adopt SFAS No. 123(R), which requires compensation
    expense to be recorded for all stock-based compensation granted
    on or after January 1, 2006, as well as the unvested
    portion of previously granted options. The Company is recording
    the compensation expense on a straight-line basis, generally
    over the explicit service period of three years (except for
    retirement eligible employees and retirees). Prior to adoption,
    the Company calculated its pro-forma footnote disclosure related
    to stock-based compensation using the explicit service period
    for all employees, and will continue to vest those awards over
    their explicit service period. Concurrent with the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), the Company changed its accounting
    policy for awards granted after January 1, 2006 to expense
    immediately awards granted to retirement eligible employees and
    to shorten the vesting period for any employee who will become
    eligible to retire within the three-year explicit service
    period. Expense for these employees will be recorded over the
    period from the date of grant through the date the employee
    first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to
    provide service.

For additional information on the impact of adopting
    SFAS No. 123(R) see Note 2. For additional
    information related to stock-based compensation, including
    activity for 2006, 2005 and 2004, see Note 10.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes on continuing operations includes
    federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Tax credits, primarily
    for research and experimentation and foreign earnings and export
    programs, are recognized as a reduction of the provision for
    income taxes on continuing operations in the year in which they
    are available for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are provided on
    temporary differences between assets and liabilities for
    financial and tax reporting purposes as measured by enacted tax
    rates expected to apply when temporary differences are settled
    or realized. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent
    that realization of those benefits is considered to be more
    likely than not. A valuation allowance is established for
    deferred tax assets for which realization is not assured. The
    Company has not provided for any residual U.S. income taxes
    on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such earnings
    are currently intended to be indefinitely reinvested.

During 2005, the Company recorded a net U.S. tax provision
    of $9.5 million related to the repatriation of
    $373.7 million of foreign dividends under the provisions of
    the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which provides for a
    favorable income tax rate on repatriated earnings, provided the
    criteria of the law are met.

See “Recent Accounting Standards” below for a
    discussion of the expected impact of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (“FIN 48”).

Research
    and Development Costs

Research and development expenditures, including qualifying
    engineering costs, are expensed when incurred and amounted to
    $155.0 million in 2006, $149.6 million in 2005 and
    $133.8 million in 2004.

Risk,
    Retention, Insurance

The Company’s property and casualty insurance programs
    contain various deductibles that, based on our experience, are
    typical and customary for a company of our size and risk
    profile. We do not consider any of the deductibles to represent
    a material risk to the Company. The Company generally maintains
    deductibles for claims and liabilities related primarily to
    workers’ compensation, health and welfare claims, general
    commercial, product and automobile liability and property
    damage, and business interruption resulting from certain events.
    The Company accrues for claim exposures that are probable of
    occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. As part of the
    Company’s risk management program, insurance is maintained
    to transfer risk beyond the level of self-



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

retention and provides protection on both an individual claim
    and annual aggregate basis. The Company currently self-insures
    its product and commercial general liability claims up to
    $5.0 million per occurrence, its workers’ compensation
    claims up to $0.5 million per occurrence, and automobile
    liability claims up to $1.0 million per occurrence.
    Third-party insurance provides primary level coverage in excess
    of these amounts up to certain specified limits. In addition,
    the Company has excess liability insurance from third-party
    insurers on both an aggregate and an individual occurrence basis
    well in excess of the limits of the primary coverage. A
    worldwide program of property insurance covers the
    Company’s owned property and any business interruptions
    that may occur due to an insured hazard affecting those
    properties, subject to reasonable deductibles and aggregate
    limits.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Effective December 31, 2006, Dover adopted
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”). For
    additional information on the adoption of this standard and
    Dover’s employee benefit plans, see Notes 2
    and 13, respectively.

Recent
    Accounting Standards

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the way
    companies are to account for uncertainty in income tax reporting
    and filing and prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for recognizing, derecognizing, and
    measuring the tax benefits of a tax position taken, or expected
    to be taken, on a tax return. Any change in net assets as a
    result of adopting the new standard is required to be recorded
    as a cumulative effect adjustment to Dover’s opening
    retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2007. The
    adoption of FIN 48 is not expected to have a material
    impact on the Company’s retained earnings balance as of
    January 1, 2007.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering
    the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”
    (“SAB 108”), which provides interpretive guidance
    on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements
    in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a
    materiality assessment. SAB 108 is effective as of the end
    of Dover’s 2006 fiscal year, allowing a one-time
    transitional cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained
    earnings as of January 1, 2006 for errors that were not
    previously deemed material, but are material under the guidance
    in SAB 108. The adoption of SAB 108 as of
    December 31, 2006 had no impact on Dover’s financial
    statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”
    (“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
    accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. This statement is effective for
    fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2007 and does
    not require any new fair value measurements. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its
    overall results of operations or financial position.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”
    (“SFAS No. 154”), which replaces APB
    No. 20 “Accounting Changes,” and
    SFAS No. 3 “Reporting Accounting Changes in
    Interim Financial Statements.” SFAS No. 154
    changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of
    a change in accounting principle, and applies to all voluntary
    changes in accounting principles, as well as changes required by
    an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that it does
    not include specific transition provisions. Specifically,
    SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to
    prior periods’ financial statements, unless it is
    impracticable to determine the period-specific effects or the
    cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 does not
    change the transition provisions of any existing pronouncement.
    SFAS No. 154 is effective for Dover for all accounting
    changes and corrections of errors made beginning January 1,
    2006 and had no impact on Dover.



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
    “Inventory Costs, An Amendment of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4”
    (“SFAS No. 151”). SFAS No. 151
    requires that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage
    costs be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when
    incurred. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 were
    applicable to inventory costs incurred beginning January 1,
    2006. The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 151 was
    immaterial to Dover’s consolidated results of operations,
    cash flows or financial position.

Stock-based
    Compensation

As discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. The following
    table illustrates the effect on net earnings and basic and
    diluted earnings per share if the Company had recognized
    compensation expense for stock options granted in prior years.
    The 2005 and 2004 pro forma amounts in this table were based on
    the explicit service periods (three years) of the options
    granted without consideration of retirement eligibility:

Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit
    Plans

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 which
    requires companies to report the funded status of their defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their
    balance sheets as a net liability or asset as of
    December 31, 2006. The new standard does not address the
    accounting treatment for pension and postretirement benefits in
    the income statement. Upon adoption at December 31, 2006,
    Dover recorded a net reduction to stockholder’s equity of
    $123.5 million, net of tax. This adjustment had no impact
    on the Company’s debt covenants.

The following table presents the effect of applying
    SFAS No. 158 on the individual line items in
    Dover’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,
    2006. For additional detail related to Dover’s Employee
    Benefit Plans, see Note 13.

3.  Acquisitions

All of the Company’s acquisitions have been accounted for
    under SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.”
    Accordingly, the accounts of the acquired companies, after
    adjustments to reflect fair market values assigned to assets and
    liabilities, have been included in the consolidated financial
    statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2006
    acquisitions (see list below) are wholly-owned and had an
    aggregate cost of $1,116.8 million, net of cash acquired,
    at the date of acquisition. There is no contingent consideration
    related to the acquisitions at December 31, 2006. In
    connection with certain acquisitions, the Company accrued a
    preliminary expense estimate of $14.7 million at the date
    of acquisition related to severance and facility closings in
    accordance with the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force

For certain acquisitions that occurred in the latter half of
    2006, the Company is in the process of obtaining or finalizing
    appraisals of tangible and intangible assets and it is
    continuing to evaluate the initial purchase price allocations,
    as of the acquisition date, which will be adjusted as additional
    information relative to the fair values of the assets and
    liabilities of the businesses becomes known. Accordingly,
    management has used their best estimate in the initial purchase
    price allocation as of the date of these financial statements.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the

•

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company finalized the

9.  Lines
    of Credit and Debt

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company closed a
    structured five-year, non-interest bearing, $165.1 million
    amortizing loan with a non-US lender, which also included a
    participation fee received by the Company of $9.9 million.
    The loan was recorded at face value. The Company also expects to
    incur a total of $5.7 million in debt related issuance
    costs over the course of the loan. Beginning in April 2007, the
    repayment schedule requires payments every April and September
    with the final payment to be made in July 2011. The
    participation fee will be amortized ratably into Other Expense
    (Income), Net over the term of the loan and is recorded in Other
    Deferrals in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The loan agreement
    includes a put and call provision that can be exercised starting
    in June of 2008 though the end of the loan term.

On October 26, 2005, the Company closed a $1 billion

5-year

unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks
    that replaces the Company’s

5-year

$600 million facility. At the Company’s election,
    loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a
    Eurodollar or alternative currency rate based on LIBOR, plus an
    applicable margin ranging from 0.125% to 0.475% (subject to
    adjustment based on the rating accorded the Company’s
    senior unsecured debt by S&P and Moody’s), or at a base
    rate pursuant to a formula defined in the credit agreement. In
    addition, the Company will pay a facility fee and a utilization
    fee in certain circumstances as described in the Credit
    Agreement. The Credit Agreement imposes various restrictions on
    the Company that are substantially identical to those in the
    replaced facilities. Among other things, the credit agreement
    generally requires the Company to maintain an interest coverage
    ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less
    than 3.5 to 1. The Company primarily uses this facility to
    support its commercial paper program and has not



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

drawn down any loans under the $1 billion facility and does
    not anticipate doing so. As of December 31, 2006, the
    Company had commercial paper outstanding in the principal amount
    of $240.0 million.

The Company established a Canadian Dollar Credit Facility in
    November 2002 with the Bank of Nova Scotia. Under the terms of
    this Credit Agreement, the Company has a Canadian (CAD)
    $30 million bank credit availability and has the option to
    borrow in either Canadian Dollars or U.S. Dollars (USD).
    The outstanding borrowings at year end under this facility were
    approximately $21 million (CAD) in 2006 and 2005. The
    covenants and interest rates under this facility match those of
    the primary $1 billion revolving credit facility. The
    Canadian Credit Facility was renewed for an additional year
    prior to its expiration date of November 22, 2006, and
    expires on November 22, 2007.

On October 13, 2005, Dover issued $300 million of
    4.875% notes due 2015 and $300 million of
    5.375% debentures due 2035. The net proceeds of
    $588.6 million from the notes and debentures were used to
    repay borrowings under Dover’s commercial paper program.
    The notes and debentures are redeemable at the option of Dover
    in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price that
    includes a make-whole premium, with accrued interest to the
    redemption date. In November 2005, the Company retired its
    6.45% notes due November 15, 2005 with a face amount
    of $250.0 million.

On November 25, 2005, the Company established a
    €75 million credit facility with Credit Lyonnais. The
    interest rate on outstanding balances is 15 basis points over
    the Euribor rate and the annual commitment fee is 5 basis
    points on unborrowed amounts. The facility has no material
    covenants. At December 31, 2006, there was no outstanding
    balance under this facility.

Notes payable shown on the consolidated balance sheets for 2006
    and 2005 principally represented commercial paper issued in the
    U.S. The weighted average interest for short-term
    borrowings for the years 2006 and 2005 was 5.0% and 3.2%,
    respectively.

Dover’s long-term debt instruments had a book value of
    $1,512.8 million on December 31, 2006 and a fair value
    of approximately $1,502.9 million. On December 31,
    2005, the Company’s long-term debt instruments had a book
    value of $1,344.2 million and a fair value of approximately
    $1,406.0 million.

    $793.8 million thereafter.

The Company may, from time to time, enter into interest rate
    swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes.
    Interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange fixed and
    variable rate payments based on notional principal amounts.



DOVER

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the third quarter of 2005, Dover entered into several
    treasury rate locks related to the notes and debentures that
    were issued on October 13, 2005. The contracts were settled
    on October 13, 2005 and the resulting gain of
    $3.0 million is being deferred in Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Earnings (Loss) and amortized over the life of the
    related notes and debentures.

As of December 31, 2006, there were two interest rate swap
    agreements outstanding for a total notional amount of
    $100.0 million, designated as fair value hedges on part of
    the Company’s $150.0 million 6.25% Notes due
    June 1, 2008. One $50 million interest rate swap
    exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest. The
    other $50 million swap is designated in foreign currency
    and exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest,
    and also hedges a portion of the Company’s net investment
    in foreign operations. The swap agreements have reduced the
    effective interest rate on the notes to 5.78%. There is no hedge
    ineffectiveness. The fair value of the interest rate swaps
    outstanding as of December 31, 2006 was determined through
    market quotation.

10.  Equity
    and Performance Incentive Program

    Equity and Cash Incentive Plan

On April 20, 2004, the stockholders approved the Dover
    Corporation 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2005
    Plan”) to replace the 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan and
    1995 Cash Performance Program (the “1995 Plan”), which
    expired on January 30, 2005. Under the 2005 Plan, a maximum
    aggregate of 20 million shares are reserved for grants
    (non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock-settled stock
    appreciation rights (“SSARs”), and restricted stock)
    to key personnel between February 1, 2005 and
    January 31, 2015, provided that no incentive stock options
    shall be granted under the plan after February 11, 2014 and
    a maximum of one million shares may be granted as restricted
    stock. The exercise price of options and SSARs may not be less
    than the fair market value of the stock at the time the awards
    are granted. The period during which these options and SSARs are
    exercisable is fixed by the Company’s Compensation
    Committee at the time of grant, but generally may not commence
    sooner than three years after the date of grant, and may not
    exceed ten years from the date of grant. All stock options or
    SSARs issued under the 1995 Plan or the 2005 Plan vest after
    three years of service and expire at the end of ten years. All
    stock options and SSARs are granted at regularly scheduled
    quarterly Compensation Committee meetings (usually only at the
    meeting during the first quarter) and have an exercise price
    equal to the fair market value of Dover stock on that day. New
    common shares are issued when options or SSARs are exercised.

In 2006, the Company issued 1,886,989 SSARs under the 2005 Plan.
    No stock options were issued in 2006 and the Company does not
    anticipate issuing stock options in the future. The fair value
    of each grant was estimated on the date of grant using a
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
    assumptions:

During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company did not purchase
    any shares of common stock in the open market. During the twelve
    months ended December 31, 2006, the Company purchased a
    total of 900,000 shares of common stock in the open market
    at an average price of $47.12.

The Company also has a restricted stock program (as part of the
    2005 Plan), under which common stock of the Company may be
    granted at no cost to certain officers and key employees. In
    general, restrictions limit the sale or transfer of these shares
    during a two or three year period, and restrictions lapse
    proportionately over the two or three year period. The Company
    did not grant any restricted shares in 2006. Restricted shares
    granted in 2005 and 2004 were 6,000, and 4,000, respectively.

In addition, the Company has a stock compensation plan under
    which non-employee directors are granted shares of Dover’s
    common stock each year as more than half of their compensation
    for serving as directors. During 2006, the Company issued an
    aggregate of 15,232 shares of its common stock to ten
    outside directors (after withholding 3,958 additional shares to
    satisfy tax obligations). During 2005, the Company issued an
    aggregate of 12,860 shares of its common stock to ten
    outside directors (after withholding an aggregate of 3,790
    additional shares to satisfy tax obligations), as partial
    compensation for serving as directors of the Company during
    2005. During 2004, the Company issued an aggregate of
    9,120 shares of its common stock to eight outside directors
    (after withholding an aggregate of 3,904 additional shares to
    satisfy tax obligations), as partial compensation for serving as
    directors of the Company during 2004.

    $123.4 million, respectively, and as of December 31,
    2005 $46.3 million and $147.6 million, respectively.
    The federal loss carryovers are available for use against the
    Company’s consolidated federal taxable income and expire in
    2024 and 2025. The entire balance of the foreign losses is
    available to be carried forward, with $13.6 million of
    these losses beginning to expire during the years 2007 through
    2013. The remaining $109.8 million of such losses can be
    carried forward indefinitely.

The Company has foreign tax credit carryovers of
    $30.5 million at December 31, 2006 and
    $26.4 million at December 31, 2005 that are available
    for use by the Company between 2007 and 2015.

The Company has research and development credits of
    $3.7 million at December 31, 2006 and
    $1.7 million at December 31, 2005 that are available
    for use by the Company between 2007 and 2026.



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2006 the Company had available alternative
    minimum tax credits of $3.1 million, which are available
    for use by the Company indefinitely, and alternative minimum tax
    foreign tax credits of $11.7 million, that are available
    for use by the Company between 2007 and 2026.

The Company maintains valuation allowances by jurisdiction
    against the deferred tax assets related to certain of these
    carryforwards as utilization of these tax benefits are not
    assured for certain jurisdictions.

The Company has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes
    or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings of its
    international subsidiaries because such earnings are reinvested
    and it is currently intended that they will continue to be
    reinvested indefinitely. At December 31, 2006, the Company
    has not provided for federal income taxes on earnings of
    approximately $387.8 million from its international
    subsidiaries.

On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”). The Act creates a
    temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
    accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent
    dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
    controlled foreign corporations. During the second half of 2005,
    the Company recorded a net U.S. tax provision of
    $9.5 million related to the repatriation of
    $373.7 million of foreign dividends under the provisions of
    the Act.

In 2006, the Company recognized an $11.0 million tax
    benefit related to the resolution of a state income tax issue.
    During 2005, the Company recognized a $25.5 million tax
    benefit, primarily related to the resolution of U.S. tax
    issues, including $5.5 million related to a favorable tax
    court decision.

Dover is continuously undergoing examination of its federal
    income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (the
    “IRS”). The Company and the IRS have settled tax years
    through 1997. The Company expects to resolve open years in
    litigation

(1998-2002)

in the near future, all within the amounts paid

and/or

reserved for these liabilities. The IRS is currently examining
    the Company’s 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns.
    Additionally, the Company is routinely involved in state and
    local income tax audits, and on occasion, foreign jurisdiction
    tax audits.

12.  Commitments
    and Contingent Liabilities

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal
    proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites
    identified under Federal and State statutes that provide for the
    allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible
    parties.” In each instance, the extent of the
    Company’s liability appears to be very small in relation to
    the total projected expenditures and the number of other
    “potentially responsible parties” involved and is
    anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few
    of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing
    remedial activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with
    regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been
    established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to
    a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their
    businesses. These proceedings primarily involve claims by
    private parties alleging injury arising out of use of the
    Company’s products, exposure to hazardous substances or
    patent infringement, litigation and administrative proceedings
    involving employment matters, and commercial disputes.
    Management and legal counsel periodically review the probable
    outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably
    expected to be incurred, the availability and extent of
    insurance coverage, and established reserves. While it is not
    possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal
    actions or any need for additional reserves, in the opinion of
    management, based on these reviews, it is very unlikely that the
    disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned
    above will have a material adverse effect on the financial
    position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive
    position of the Company.

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
    operating leases, many of which contain renewal options. Total
    rental expense, net of insignificant sublease rental income, on
    all operating leases was $55.5 million, $53.8 million
    and $35.4 million for the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Contingent

rentals under the operating leases were not significant.
    Aggregate future minimum lease payments for operating leases as
    of December 31, 2006 are $43.0 million in 2007,
    $34.1 million in 2008, $25.4 million in 2009,
    $18.3 million in 2010 and $53.7 million thereafter.

Aggregate future minimum lease payments for capital leases as of
    December 31, 2006 are $2.6 million in 2007,
    $2.4 million in 2008, $1.8 million in 2009,

13.  Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer a defined
    contribution plan to their employees. The Company also has
    defined benefit pension plans (the “plans”) covering
    certain employees of Dover and its subsidiaries. The plans’
    benefits are generally based on years of service and employee
    compensation. The Company’s funding policy is consistent
    with the funding requirements of ERISA and applicable foreign
    law. Dover uses a measurement date of September 30th for
    the majority of its pension and other postretirement benefit
    plans.

The Company is responsible for overseeing the management of the
    investments of the plans’ assets and otherwise ensuring
    that the plans’ investment programs are in compliance with
    ERISA, other relevant legislation, and related plan documents.
    Where relevant, the Company has retained professional investment
    managers to manage the plans’ assets and implement the
    investment process. The investment managers, in implementing
    their investment processes, have the authority and
    responsibility to select appropriate investments in the asset
    classes specified by the terms of their applicable prospectus or
    investment manager agreements with the plans.

The primary financial objective of the plans is to secure
    participant retirement benefits. Accordingly, the key objective
    in the plans’ financial management is to promote stability
    and, to the extent appropriate, growth in funded status. Related
    and supporting financial objectives are established in
    conjunction with a review of current and projected plan
    financial requirements.

The assets of the plans are invested to achieve an appropriate
    return for the plans consistent with a prudent level of risk.
    The asset return objective is to achieve, as a minimum over
    time, the passively managed return earned by market index funds,
    weighted in the proportions outlined by the asset class
    exposures identified in the plans’ strategic allocation.

The Expected Return on Asset Assumption used for pension expense
    was developed through analysis of historical market returns,
    current market conditions, and the past experience of plan asset
    investments. In developing the Expected Return on Asset
    Assumption, estimates of future market returns by asset category
    are less than actual long-term historical returns in order to
    best anticipate future experience. Overall, it is projected that
    the investment of plan assets will achieve an 8.0% net return
    over time from the asset allocation strategy.

Dover’s discount rate assumption is determined by
    constructing a portfolio of bonds to match the expected benefit
    stream to be paid from the plans. The benefit payment stream is
    assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities, as well
    as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio.



DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company also provides, through non-qualified plans,
    supplemental retirement benefits in excess of qualified plan
    limits imposed by Federal tax law. These plans are supported by
    the general assets of the Company.

Dover has reflected the acquisition of the Markem Corporation
    United Kingdom defined benefit plan and its liabilities in its
    financial statements, effective December 6, 2006. In
    accordance with purchase accounting rules, the Company recorded
    the unfunded pension benefit obligation (“PBO”) of
    $50.5 million along with the related plan assets of
    $29.5 million as of the merger date.

In addition, Dover has reflected the acquisition of the Markem
    Corporation post-retirement defined benefit plan and its
    liabilities. In accordance with purchase accounting rules, the
    Company recorded the unfunded accrued post-retirement benefit of
    $5.4 million as of the merger date.

During 2005, Dover reflected the acquisition of the Knowles
    Electronics Holdings Inc. defined benefit plan and its
    liabilities in its financial statements, effective
    September 27, 2005. Accordingly, Dover recorded the PBO of
    $96.2 million along with related plan assets of
    $68.5 million as of the merger date. Subsequent to the
    acquisition date of the defined benefit plan, Dover made a
    contribution of $18 million in the third quarter of 2005.

Pension cost for all defined contribution, defined benefit, and
    supplemental plans was $70.5 million for 2006,
    $48.0 million for 2005, and $33.2 million for 2004.

For post-retirement benefit measurement purposes, an 11% annual
    rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits
    (i.e., health care cost trend rates) was assumed for 2007; the
    rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.00% by the year 2013
    and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend
    rate assumption can have an effect on the amounts reported. For
    example, increasing (decreasing) the assumed health care cost
    trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase
    (decrease) the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as
    of December 31, 2006, by $0.7 million
    ($0.6 million) and the net post-retirement benefit cost for
    2006 by approximately $0.1 million ($0.1 million).

The post-retirement benefit plans cover approximately 2,200
    participants, approximately 750 of whom are eligible for medical
    benefits. The plans are effectively closed to new entrants. The
    post-retirement benefit obligation amounts at December 31,
    2006 and 2005 include approximately $4.3 million and
    $9.1 million in obligations, respectively, recorded in
    discontinued operations.

14.  Segment
    Data

On January 1, 2005, the Company realigned its segment
    structure from four to six segments. All years presented have
    been conformed to the current year presentation.

Dover identifies its operating segments through the underlying
    management reporting structure related to its operating
    companies and through commonalities related to products,
    processes, distribution,

and/or

markets served. The Company’s segment structure allows the
    management of each segment to focus its attention on particular
    markets and provide oversight capacity to acquire additional
    businesses.

Dover’s six reportable segments are briefly described below:

Diversified builds sophisticated products for use in the
    defense, aerospace and automotive industries, heat transfer
    equipment, specialized bearings, construction and agricultural
    cabs, as well as color measurement and control systems for
    printing presses.

Electronics manufactures advanced micro-component products for
    the hearing aid and consumer electronics industries, quick
    disconnect couplings for a wide variety of biomedical and
    commercial applications, high frequency capacitors, microwave
    electro-magnetic switches, radio frequency and microwave
    filters, electromagnetic products, and frequency control/select
    components. In addition, this segment manufactures ATM hardware
    and software for retail and financial institutions and chemical
    proportioning and dispensing systems for the food service,
    health care, supermarket, industrial and other various markets.

Industries makes equipment and components for use in waste
    handling, bulk transport, automotive service, and construction

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31,
    2006 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
    Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
    Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and
    communicated to the Company’s management, including its
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

During the fourth quarter of 2006, there were no changes in the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations Over Internal Controls

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that:

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that the Company’s receipts and
    expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of the Company’s management and
    directors; and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Management’s report on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the
    Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all
    errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
    are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
    the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
    of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
    of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance
    that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have
    been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those
    internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company has three compensation plans under which equity
    securities of the Company have been authorized for issuance and
    have been issued to employees and to non-employee directors.
    These are the 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan and 1995 Cash
    Performance Program (the “1995 Plan”), the 2005 Equity
    and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”) and the 1996
    Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Compensation Plan (the
    “Directors’



Plan”). The information regarding the 2005 Plan and the
    Directors’ Plan that is required to be included pursuant to
    this Item 12 is included under the captions “Equity
    Plans” (following the table entitled “Outstanding
    Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End”) and
    “Directors’ Compensation,” respectively, in the
    2007 Proxy Statement and is incorporated in this Item 12 by
    reference. The table above does not reflect shares eligible for
    issuance under the 1996 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock
    Compensation Plan, which does not specify a maximum number of
    shares issuable under it.

The 1995 Plan was adopted in 1995 (replacing the 1984 Plan which
    expired in January 1995) and provided for stock options,
    restricted stock awards and cash performance awards. The 1995
    Plan expired in January 2005, but Column A of the table above
    includes options that remain outstanding under it.

The 1995 Plan was intended to promote the medium-term and
    long-term success of Dover by providing salaried officers and
    other key employees of Dover and its subsidiaries with
    medium-range and long-range inducements to remain with Dover and
    to encourage them to increase their efforts to make Dover
    successful. Options granted under the 1995 Plan were all
    designated as non-qualified stock options.

The exercise price of options is the fair market value on the
    date of grant as determined in good faith by the Compensation
    Committee. Options granted under this plan may not be sold,
    transferred, hypothecated, pledged or otherwise disposed of by
    any of the holders except by will or by the laws of descent and
    distribution except that a holder may transfer any non-qualified
    option granted under this plan to members of the holder’s
    immediate family, or to one or more trusts for the benefit of
    such family members provided that the holder does not receive
    any consideration for the transfer.

The information above summarizes the material aspects of the
    1995 Plan. The rights and obligations of participants are
    determined by the provisions of the plan document itself.

Item 13.

    of such individuals that are required to be included pursuant to
