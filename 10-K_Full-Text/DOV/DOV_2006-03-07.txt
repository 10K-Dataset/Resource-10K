PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Dover Corporation (“Dover” or the
    “Company”), incorporated in 1947 in the State of
    Delaware, became a publicly traded company in 1955. It is a
    diversified industrial manufacturing corporation encompassing
    operating companies that manufacture a broad range of
    specialized industrial products and sophisticated manufacturing
    equipment and seek to expand their range of related services.
    Additional information is contained in Items 7 and 8.

The Company reports its results in six reportable business
    segments, Diversified, Electronics, Industries, Resources,
    Systems and Technologies, and discusses their operations in 13
    groups. Diversified builds products for use in the defense,
    aerospace and automotive aftermarket industries, heat transfer
    equipment, specialized bearings, construction and agricultural
    cabs, as well as color measurement and control systems for
    printing presses. Electronics designs and manufactures a wide
    variety of electronic, electromechanical, and plastic components
    for original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) serving
    numerous end markets including hearing aids, telecom
    infrastructure and cell phones, defense and aerospace
    electronics, and medical/life sciences. In addition, this
    segment manufactures ATM hardware and software for retail
    applications and financial institutions, and chemical
    proportioning and dispensing systems for janitorial/sanitation
    applications. Industries produces equipment and components for
    use in waste handling, bulk transport and automotive service
    industries. Resources manufactures products primarily for the
    petroleum and natural gas, automotive fueling, fluid handling,
    engineered components, material handling and chemical equipment
    industries. Systems manufactures refrigeration systems, display
    cases, walk in coolers, food service cooking equipment and other
    products for the supermarket/restaurant industries. In addition,
    this segment manufactures specialized machinery for use in the
    beverage and food processing industries. Technologies builds
    sophisticated automated assembly and testing equipment for the
    electronics industry, and industrial printers and consumables
    for coding and marking.

Business
    Strategy

The Company operates with certain fundamental strategies. First,
    it seeks to acquire and own businesses with proprietary,
    engineered industrial products which make them leaders in the
    niche markets they serve. To ensure success, the Dover companies
    place emphasis on new product development to better serve
    customers and expansion into new markets to serve new customers.
    Second, these businesses are committed to operational excellence
    and all of Dover’s operating companies are expected to be
    market leaders as measured by market share, customer service,
    innovation, profitability and return on invested capital. Third,
    the Company is committed to an autonomous operating culture with
    high ethical standards, trust, respect and open communication,
    to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness.

Management
    Philosophy

The Company practices a highly decentralized management style.
    The presidents of the operating companies are given a great deal
    of autonomy and have a high level of independent responsibility
    for their businesses and their performance. This is in keeping
    with the Company’s operating philosophy that independent
    operations are better able to serve customers by focusing
    closely on their products and markets, and reacting quickly to
    customer needs. The Company’s executive management role is
    to provide management oversight, allocate and manage capital,
    assist in major acquisitions, evaluate, motivate and, as
    necessary, replace operating company management, and also
    provide selected other services.

Acquisitions

Dover has a long-standing acquisition program, which seeks to
    acquire and develop “platform” businesses that are
    market leaders as measured by market share, customer service,
    innovation, profitability and return on invested capital. Ideal
    acquisition candidates are generally manufacturers of high
    value-added, engineered products sold to a broad customer base
    of industrial or commercial users. One of the most critical
    factors in the decision to acquire a business is the
    Company’s judgment of the skill, energy, ethics and
    compatibility of the top executives at the


acquisition target. Keeping with the Company’s
    decentralized structure, Dover generally expects that acquired
    companies will continue to be operated by the management team in
    place at acquisition, with a high degree of autonomy.

The Company has traditionally focused on acquiring new
    businesses that can operate independently from other Dover
    companies (“stand-alones”). Beginning in 1993, the
    Company began increasing the number of “add-on”
    businesses it acquired — businesses that could be
    added on to existing Dover companies. In recent years, including
    2005, the Company has indicated an intention to buy larger
    stand-alones, while continuing to acquire “add-on”
    businesses to enhance companies already owned.

From January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2005, the
    Company made 68 acquisitions at a total acquisition cost of
    $2,900.8 million. These acquisitions have had a substantial
    impact on the Company’s revenue and earnings since 2000.
    During the three years

2001-2003,

the overall number of Company acquisitions and dollars invested
    was lower than in previous years. This largely reflected the
    general economic conditions and the lack of attractive
    acquisition candidates. In 2004, the Company acquired eight
    add-on businesses for an aggregate of $514.3 million.
    During 2005, the Company acquired a total of ten businesses
    (eight add-ons) for an aggregate cost of $1,091.8 million,
    the highest annual acquisition investment level in its history.
    For more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past
    two years, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8. The Company’s future growth
    depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful
    businesses, as a substantial number of the Company’s
    current businesses operate in relatively mature markets. While
    the Company expects all of its businesses to generate annual
    internal growth of 5 – 7%, sustained internal
    growth at these levels is difficult to achieve.

Divestitures

In 2006, Dover is entering the second year of a strategic review
    of its portfolio of businesses, a process that has improved the
    Company’s focus on key markets for long-term growth. While
    the Company generally expects to hold businesses that it buys,
    it periodically reassesses the portfolio of businesses to verify
    that those businesses continue to be essential contributors to
    Dover’s long-term growth strategy. On occasion, there are
    situations in which one of Dover’s companies is a very
    attractive acquisition for another company based on specific
    market conditions. In those circumstances, Dover might make an
    opportunistic sale, such as the 2005 sale of Hydratight Sweeney
    and the agreement to sell Tranter PHE. In addition, the Company
    will strategically divest operations that cannot meet
    Dover’s long-term performance goals, such as the 2005 sales
    of Somero Enterprises and Koolant Koolers. Based on these
    criteria, the Company has from time to time divested businesses.
    Over the past five years, the Company has discontinued 26 and
    sold 21 operations for an aggregate pre-tax consideration of
    approximately $619 million. For more details, see the
    “Discontinued Operations” discussion below and
    Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8.

Reportable
    Segments

The Company reports its results in six segments and discusses
    their operations in 13 groups. The segment structure is based on
    markets served and allows the management of each segment to
    focus its attention on particular markets, to provide oversight
    capacity to acquire additional businesses and to foster
    leadership development. Below is a listing of each segment and
    the descriptions of each group therein. For additional financial
    information about Dover’s reportable segments, see
    Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in

    contacts. The repair equipment companies supply solder
    management tools, repair workstations and fluid dispensing
    systems.

Product
    Identification and Printing

The Product Identification and Printing group (“PIP”)
    is a worldwide supplier of industrial marking and coding
    systems. Its primary printing products are based on Continuous
    Ink Jet (“CIJ”) technology, which is used for marking
    variable information (such as date codes or serial numbers) on
    consumer products. It provides a broad array of printing
    technologies, including laser, Drop on Demand (“DOD”),
    Thermal Transfer on Line (“TTOL”) and direct thermal.
    PIP provides solutions for product marking on primary packaging,
    secondary packaging such as cartons, and pallet marking for use
    in warehouse logistics operations. PIP also manufactures bar
    code printers and related products and narrow web printing
    presses used for producing pressure sensitive labels, small
    folding cartons and flexible packaging. The markets served by
    PIP include food, beverage, cosmetics, pharmaceutical,
    electronics, automotive and other applications where variable
    marking is required.

The Technologies segment has operations and manufacturing
    facilities in North America, Europe and Asia.

Discontinued
    Operations

Companies that are considered discontinued operations in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” are presented
    separately in the consolidated statements of operations and
    balance sheets and are not included in continuing operations.
    Earnings from discontinued operations includes charges to reduce
    these businesses to estimated fair value less costs to sell.
    Fair value is determined by using quoted market prices, when
    available, or other accepted valuation techniques. All interim
    and full year reporting periods presented reflect the
    discontinued operations discussed below on a comparable basis.
    Please refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for additional information.

Earnings from discontinued operations for the year were
    $35.7 million or $0.17 diluted earnings per share
    (“EPS”) compared to earnings of $18.6 million or
    $0.09 EPS in the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2005,
    Dover sold Koolant Koolers, which previously reported within the
    Service Equipment group of the Industries segment and
    discontinued a minor business in the Resources segment in the
    Material Handling group. Earlier in 2005, the Company
    discontinued and sold Somero Enterprises, which previously
    reported within the Mobile Equipment group of the Industries
    segment. Dover also discontinued and entered into an agreement
    to sell Tranter PHE, which previously reported within the
    Process Equipment group of the Diversified segment, and
    discontinued one other business, which previously reported
    within the Packaging group of the Systems segment. Also during
    2005, Dover


discontinued Hydratight Sweeney, a business in the Diversified
    segment, that was sold on May 17, 2005, and discontinued
    one minor business from the Industries segment, that was
    subsequently sold on April 1, 2005.

Charges to reduce these discontinued businesses to their
    estimated fair values have been recorded in earnings from
    discontinued operations, net of tax. During 2005, the Company
    discontinued a business in the Systems segment, resulting in a
    goodwill and intangible asset impairment of approximately
    $55.0 million. No charges related to the write off of
    goodwill or other long-lived asset impairments were recorded in
    2004. For 2003, pre-tax charges were recorded to write off
    goodwill of $17.3 million and other long-lived asset
    impairments and other charges were recorded of $0.2 million.

Also, during 2005, in connection with the completion of a
    federal income tax audit, the Company adjusted its tax reserves
    relating to certain discontinued operations, resulting in tax
    benefits of $25.7 million.

During 2004, the Company discontinued and sold one business in
    the Technologies segment in the first quarter of 2004 and sold
    five businesses that were discontinued in 2003 for a net after
    tax loss of $2.4 million.

During 2003, the Company discontinued five businesses, three in
    the Diversified segment and one business in each of the
    Industries and Resources segments, all of which were classified
    as held for sale as of December 31, 2003. In the aggregate,
    these businesses were not material to the Company’s
    results. In addition, during 2003, the Company disposed of five
    businesses that were previously discontinued in 2002 for a net
    after tax gain of $4.9 million.

Also, during 2003, in connection with the completion of a
    federal income tax audit and commercial resolution of other
    issues, the Company adjusted certain reserves established in
    connection with the sales of previously discontinued operations
    and recorded a gain on the sales of discontinued operations, net
    of tax, of $16.6 million, and additional tax benefits of
    $5.1 million related to losses previously incurred on sales
    of businesses. These amounts were offset by charges of
    $13.6 million, net of tax, to reduce discontinued
    businesses to their estimated fair value, and a loss on the sale
    of discontinued operations, net of tax, of $6.0 million
    related to contingent liabilities from previously discontinued
    operations.

Raw
    Materials

Dover’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw
    materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished
    components, which are generally available from a number of
    sources. As a result, shortages or the loss of any single
    supplier have not had, and are not likely to have, a material
    impact on operating profits. During 2002, steel tariffs were
    imposed on the importation of certain steel products, which had
    a slight adverse impact on a number of Dover operating companies
    that use large amounts of steel. These tariffs remained in
    effect throughout most of 2003 and were repealed late in the
    year. In 2004, there were meaningful increases in raw material
    costs, particularly steel, and higher energy costs, including an
    estimated increase in unrecovered steel costs of
    $35 million. These increases primarily affected the
    Company’s industrial segments. In 2005, the impact of
    commodity prices moderated and most of the operating companies
    were able to offset cost increases with surcharges and price
    increases.

Research
    and Development

Dover’s operating companies are encouraged to develop new
    products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to
    satisfy customer needs, expand revenue opportunities
    domestically and internationally, maintain or extend competitive
    advantages, improve product reliability and reduce production
    costs. During 2005, $192.2 million was spent on research
    and development, including qualified engineering costs, compared
    with $181.4 million and $151.5 million in 2004 and
    2003, respectively.

For the Technologies and Electronics companies, efforts in these
    areas tend to be particularly significant because the rate of
    product development by their customers is often quite high. In
    general, the Technologies companies that provide electronic
    assembly equipment and services believe that their customers
    expect the performance capabilities of such equipment to improve
    significantly over time, with a concurrent lowering of operating
    costs and increasing efficiency. Significant new product
    development and introduction costs were incurred in

2003-2004,

and moderated in 2005. Likewise, Electronics companies
    developing specialty electronic


components for the datacom and telecom commercial markets
    believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product
    performance improvement and reduced costs. The result has been
    that product life cycles in these markets generally average less
    than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that
    time period.

Dover’s other segments contain many businesses that are
    also involved in important product improvement initiatives.
    These businesses also concentrate on working closely with
    customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and
    market applications, and continuously improving manufacturing
    processes. Most of these businesses experience a much more
    moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is
    generally experienced by the Technologies and Electronics
    businesses.

Intellectual
    Property

Dover companies own many patents, trademarks, licenses and other
    forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over a
    number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various
    times over a number of years. A large portion of the Dover
    companies’ intellectual property consists of confidential
    and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that the
    companies seek to protect in various ways, including
    confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where
    appropriate. While the Dover companies’ intellectual
    property is important to their success, the loss or expiration
    of any of these rights, or any groups of related rights,
    probably would not materially affect the Company on a
    consolidated basis. The Company believes that its
    companies’ commitment to continuous engineering
    improvements, new product development and improved manufacturing
    techniques, as well as strong sales, marketing and service
    efforts, are significant to their general leadership position in
    the niche markets that they serve.

Seasonality

In general, operations of the Dover companies, while not
    seasonal, tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third
    quarters, particularly companies serving the consumer
    electronics, transportation, construction, waste hauling,
    petroleum, commercial refrigeration and food service markets.
    Companies serving the major equipment markets, such as power
    generation, chemical and processing industries, tend to have
    long lead times geared to seasonal, commercial or consumer
    demands, and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and
    delivery to coincide with those market trends.

Customers

Dover’s companies serve thousands of customers, no one of
    which accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s
    consolidated revenue in 2005. One customer within the Systems
    segment accounted for approximately 20% of Systems revenue
    during 2005. Within each of the other five segments, no customer
    accounted for more than 10% of that segment’s revenue in
    2005.

The Components group within the Electronics segment serves the
    military, space, aerospace, commercial and datacom/telecom
    infrastructure markets. Its customers include some of the
    largest operators in these markets. In addition, many of the OEM
    customers of the Components group outsource their manufacturing
    to Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”)
    companies. The CAT group customers include many of the largest
    global EMS companies, particularly some of the newer EMS
    companies in China.

In the other Dover segments, customer concentrations are quite
    varied. Companies supplying the automotive and commercial
    refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers
    that are significant within those industries. This also tends to
    be true for companies supplying the power generation, aerospace
    and chemical industries. In the other markets served, there is
    usually a much lower concentration of customers, particularly
    where the companies provide a substantial number of products and
    services applicable to a broad range of end use applications.

Backlog

Backlog generally is not a significant factor in most of
    Dover’s businesses, as most of the products of Dover
    companies have relatively short

order-to-delivery

periods. It is more relevant to those businesses that produce
    larger


and more sophisticated machines or have long-term government
    contracts, primarily in the Diversified segment, as well as the
    Mobile Equipment group within the Industries segment, the CAT
    group within the Technologies segment and the Components group
    within the Electronics segment. Total Company backlog as of
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $1,276.5 million and
    $996.0 million, respectively.

Competition

Dover’s competitive environment is complex because of the
    wide diversity of the products its companies manufacture and the
    markets they serve. In general, most Dover companies are market
    leaders, which compete with only a few companies and the key
    competitive factors are customer service, product quality and
    innovation. Dover usually is a more significant competitor
    domestically, where its principal markets are, than in foreign
    markets; however, Dover companies are becoming increasingly
    global where greater competition exists.

In the Technologies segment, Dover companies compete globally
    against a few very large companies, primarily operating in
    Japan, Europe and elsewhere in the Far East. Their primary
    competitors are Japanese and European manufacturers.

Within the other segments, competition is primarily domestic,
    although an increasing number of Dover companies see more
    international competitors and several serve markets which are
    predominantly international, particularly certain companies in
    the Electronics, Systems, Resources and Diversified segments.

International

For foreign revenue, including exports, and an allocation of the
    assets of the Company’s continuing operations, see
    Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Although international operations are subject to certain risks,
    such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and foreign
    governmental restrictions, Dover intends to increase its
    expansion into foreign markets, including South America, Asia
    and Eastern Europe.

The countries where most of Dover’s foreign subsidiaries
    and affiliates are based are France, Germany, the U.K., the
    Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and, with increased emphasis,
    China.

Environmental
    Matters

Dover believes its operations generally are in substantial
    compliance with applicable regulations. In a few instances,
    particular plants and businesses have been the subject of
    administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies
    or private parties relating to the discharge or potential
    discharge of regulated substances. Where necessary, these
    matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to
    achieve compliance. Dover believes that continued compliance
    will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    position and will not require significant expenditures or
    adjustments to reserves.

Employees

The Company had approximately 31,650 employees in continuing
    operations as of December 31, 2005.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash
    flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including but not
    limited to those set forth below, any one of which could cause
    our actual results to vary materially


from recent results or from anticipated future results. For a
    discussion identifying additional risk factors and important
    factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
    from those anticipated, see the discussion in “SPECIAL
    NOTES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” included
    in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Cyclical
    Economic Conditions May Affect our Financial
    Performance

A meaningful portion of the Company’s revenue, most notably
    from the Circuit Assembly and Test group in the Technologies
    segment, is derived from companies in capital goods markets that
    are subject to inherently unpredictable business cycles. As a
    result, the revenue and operating performance of these companies
    in any one period are not necessarily predictive of their
    revenue and operating performance in other periods, and could
    have a material impact on Dover’s consolidated financial
    position.

In addition, Dover is subject to substantially the same risk
    factors as other

U.S.-based

industrial manufacturers. However, except as noted above, the
    structure of Dover and the many different markets its companies
    serve mitigate the possibility that any of these risk factors
    will materially impact Dover’s consolidated financial
    position.

The facilities are generally well maintained and suitable for

    modest increases in capacity for a few businesses experiencing
    strong growth demands.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal
    proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites
    identified under Federal and State statutes which provide for
    the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible
    parties.” In each instance the extent of the Company’s
    liability appears to be very small in relation to the total
    projected expenditures and the number of other “potentially
    responsible parties” involved and is anticipated to be
    immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few of the
    Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial
    activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with
    regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been
    established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to
    a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their
    businesses. These proceedings primarily involve claims by
    private parties alleging injury arising out of use of products
    of Dover companies, exposure to hazardous substances or patent
    infringement, litigation and administrative proceedings
    involving employment matters, and commercial disputes.
    Management and legal counsel periodically review the probable
    outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably
    expected to be incurred, the availability and extent of
    insurance coverage, and established reserves. While it is not
    possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal
    actions or any need for additional reserves, in the opinion of
    management, based on these reviews, it is very unlikely that the
    disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned
    above will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial position, results of operations, cash flows or
    competitive position.

The number of holders of record of the Company’s Common
    Stock as of January 31, 2006 was approximately 13,500. This
    figure includes participants in the Company’s 401(k)
    program.

In 2005, pursuant to the Dover Corporation 1996 Non-Employee
    Directors’ Stock Compensation Plan (the
    “Directors’ Plan”), the Company issued an
    aggregate of 12,860 shares of its Common Stock to ten
    outside directors (after withholding an aggregate of 3,790
    additional shares to satisfy tax obligations), as compensation
    for serving part or all of the year as directors of the Company
    during 2005.

Under the Directors’ Plan as amended effective
    November 4, 2004, non-employee Directors receive annual
    compensation in an amount set by the Board, payable partly in
    cash and partly in Dover’s common stock as such allocations
    may be adjusted from time to time by the Board of Directors,
    subject to the limitation set forth in the Directors’ Plan
    on the maximum number of shares that may be granted to any
    Director in any year (10,000 shares). For 2004, annual
    compensation was set at $90,000, payable 25% in cash and 75% in
    common stock. For 2005, annual compensation was set at $120,000,
    payable 40% in cash and 60% in common stock. The 2005
    compensation of $120,000 was paid by $48,000 in cash and
    1,800 shares, based on the fair market value of
    Dover’s common stock on November 15, 2005. In each of
    2004 and 2005, the chair of the Audit Committee received
    additional compensation of $10,000.

The table listed below presents shares of the Company’s
    stock which were acquired by the Company during the fourth
    quarter. These shares were acquired by the Company from the
    holders of its employee stock options when they tendered shares
    as full or partial payment of the exercise price of such
    options. These shares are applied against the exercise price at
    the market price on the date of exercise.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Management assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its
    ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and
    financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity
    are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital
    expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, adequacy of
    commercial paper and available bank lines of credit, and the
    ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.
    The Company generates substantial cash from operations and
    remains in a strong financial position, with enough liquidity
    available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic
    acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a short and
    long-term basis.

The following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements
    of Cash Flows:

)

Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2005
    increased $82.1 million, or 14%, compared to 2004, which
    included a tax refund of approximately $41 million. The
    increase in cash flows provided by operations reflected higher
    net earnings and incremental decreases in working capital, which
    was partially offset by an $18.0 million pension
    contribution, higher benefits and compensation payouts and an
    increase in tax payments of approximately $83 million in
    2005.

Cash used in investing activities during 2005 increased
    $547.5 million compared to 2004, reflecting an increase in
    acquisition and capital expenditure activity, partially offset
    by proceeds from the disposition of businesses and sale of
    property and equipment. Acquisition expenditures in 2005 were
    $1,091.8 million compared to $506.1 million in 2004.
    Capital expenditures in 2005 increased $49.6 million to
    $152.1 million as compared to $102.5 million in 2004,
    primarily due to investments in plant expansions, plant
    machinery and information systems. Proceeds from the disposition
    of businesses increased $85.4 million to
    $159.3 million. The Company currently anticipates that any
    additional acquisitions made during 2006 will be funded from
    available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary,
    through the issuance of commercial paper, established lines of
    credit or public debt markets. Capital expenditures for 2006 are
    expected to increase moderately over 2005 levels.

Cash provided by financing activities during 2005 totaled
    $272.8 million as compared to cash used in financing
    activities of $101.0 million during 2004. The net change in
    cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a net
    increase in borrowings of $439.5 million that were used to
    fund current year acquisitions partially offset by cash used in
    the repurchase of treasury shares $51.9 million and
    dividends paid of $133.9 million.

Adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure; calculated as
    accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable)
    increased from December 31, 2004 by $16.4 million or
    1.3% to $1,292.1 million, primarily driven by increases in
    receivables of $127.1 million, increases in payables of
    $56.9 million offset by decreases in inventory of
    $53.8 million. Excluding the impact of acquisitions on
    working capital of $80.7 million and changes in


foreign currency of $49.3 million, working capital
    decreased by $15.0 million or 3% from December 31,
    2004. The increase in receivables was driven by increased
    revenue activity and acquisitions of $54.0 million,
    partially offset by decreases due to foreign currency
    fluctuations of $48.9 million. The inventory balance
    decrease was driven by operations and decreases due to foreign
    currency fluctuations of $23.8 million, partially offset by
    acquisitions of $59.5 million. Increases in accounts
    payable were a result of a concerted effort by management to
    better align the payable cycle with the Company’s cash
    receipts cycle, acquisitions of $32.8 million, partially
    offset by a decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations of
    $23.4 million.

In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage
    based upon the operating, investing and financing
    classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flow, the Company also measures free cash flow (a non-GAAP
    measure). Management believes that free cash flow is an
    important measure of operating performance because it provides
    both management and investors a measurement of cash generated
    from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay
    dividends, repay debt and repurchase Dover’s common stock.
    For further information see Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end
    of this Item 7.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
    $507.5 million or 8.3% of revenue compared to
    $475.0 million or 9.1% of revenue in the prior year period,
    which included a tax refund of approximately $41 million in
    the first quarter of 2004. The 2005 increase in free cash flow
    reflected higher net earnings and incremental decreases in
    working capital, which was partially offset by pension
    contributions of $18.0 million to the Knowles Electronics
    Holdings, Inc. pension plan, higher benefits and compensation
    payouts and increased capital expenditures of $49.6 million
    and tax payments of approximately $83 million. The
    following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow with cash
    flows from operating activities.

At December 31, 2005, the Company’s net property,
    plant, and equipment totaled $816.7 million compared to
    $727.0 million at the end of 2004. The increase in net
    property, plant and equipment reflected acquisitions of
    $100.3 million, capital expenditures of
    $152.1 million, partially offset by decreases related to
    foreign currency fluctuation of $22.7 million and
    depreciation.

The aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities increased from a $425.9 million net liability
    at the beginning of the year to $428.2 million at year-end
    2005. This resulted primarily from decreases in current tax
    liabilities, increases in deferred tax assets from accruals and
    net operating loss carryforwards (primarily acquisition
    related), partially offset by an increase in deferred tax
    liabilities related to intangible assets.

Dover’s consolidated pension benefit obligation increased
    by $160.7 million in 2005. The increase was due principally
    to acquisitions of $96.2 million and actuarial losses
    related to lower discount rate assumptions. Offsetting this,
    plan assets increased $111.0 million due to acquisitions of
    $68.5 million, gains on plan investments during the year
    and Company contributions of $18.0 million, which were
    partially offset by the payouts of benefits. During 2005, plan
    amendments created an increase in the benefit obligation of
    $9.7 million. Due to the decrease in the net funded status
    of the plans and the increase in the amortization of
    unrecognized losses, it is estimated that pension expense will
    increase from $26.7 million to approximately
    $41 million in 2006. The Company anticipates discretionary
    contributions to its pension benefit plans of under
    $25 million in 2006.


The Company utilizes the total debt and net debt to total
    capitalization calculations (a non-GAAP measure) to assess its
    overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the
    calculations are useful to its stockholders for the same
    reasons. The following table provides a reconciliation of total
    debt and net debt to total capitalization to the most directly
    comparable GAAP measures:

The total debt level of $1,538.4 million as of
    December 31, 2005 increased $446.1 million from
    December 31, 2004 as a result of an increase in borrowings
    to fund acquisitions made in 2005. On October 26, 2005, the
    Company closed a $1 billion

5-year

unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks
    that replaces the Company’s $400 million

364-day

facility and its

5-year

$600 million facility. This facility is primarily used to
    support the Company’s commercial paper borrowings and had
    no outstanding balance at December 31, 2005. In addition,
    on October 13, 2005, Dover issued $300 million of
    4.875% notes due 2015 and $300 million of
    5.375% debentures due 2035. The net proceeds from the notes
    and debentures were used to fund acquisitions. The notes and
    debentures are redeemable at the option of Dover in whole or in
    part at any time at a redemption price that includes a
    make-whole premium, with accrued interest to the redemption date.

Also, on November 25, 2005, the Company entered into a
    3 year, € 75 million credit facility. This
    facility had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2005.

Dover’s long-term debt instruments had a book value of
    $1,345.4 million on December 31, 2005 and a fair value
    of approximately $1,406.0 million. On December 31,
    2004, the Company’s long-term debt instruments had a book
    value of $1,005.7 million and a fair value of approximately
    $1,093.0 million.

The Company was in compliance with the covenants related to its
    debt as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

The Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are
    adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable
    risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future.
    Acquisition spending may increase Company debt. However,
    management anticipates that the debt to capital ratio will
    remain generally consistent with historical levels. Operating
    cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy
    the Company’s various cash flow requirements, including for
    acquisition spending and capital expenditures.

Management is not aware of any potential impairment to the
    Company’s liquidity, and the Company is in compliance with
    all of its long-term debt covenants. It is anticipated that in
    2006 any funding requirements above cash generated from
    operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper
    or, depending upon market conditions, through the issuance of
    long-term debt or some combination of the two.

During the third quarter 2005, Dover entered into several
    treasury rate locks related to the October 13, 2005 notes
    and debentures. The contracts were settled on October 13,
    2005 and the resulting gain of $3.0 million is being
    deferred and amortized over the life of the related notes and
    debentures.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had two interest rate
    swaps outstanding for a total notional amount of
    $100.0 million, designated as fair value hedges of the
    $150.0 million 6.25% Notes due on June 1, 2008.
    One $50 million interest rate swap exchanged fixed-rate
    interest for variable-rate interest. The other $50 million
    swap is


designated in foreign currency, and exchanges fixed-rate
    interest for variable-rate interest, and also hedges a portion
    of the Company’s net investment in foreign operations. The
    swap agreements reduced the effective interest rate on the notes
    to 5.12%. There was no hedge ineffectiveness as of
    December 31, 2005, and the aggregate fair value of these
    interest rate swaps of $0.9 million was determined through
    market quotation and is reported in other assets and long-term
    debt.

During 2005, the Company entered into derivative contracts to
    hedge potential foreign currency volatility on current assets
    and liabilities. The contracts were designated as cash flow
    hedges and were considered by management to be highly effective.
    The derivative foreign exchange contracts settled during 2005
    and resulted in a gain of approximately $0.6 million, which
    is recognized in Other (income), expense, net.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had open foreign exchange
    forward purchase contracts expiring through December 2006

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS:

    COMPARED TO 2004

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Revenue for 2005 of $6,078.4 million was up
    $861.3 million or 17% from 2004, primarily driven by
    increases at all six segments led by $291.7 million at
    Resources and $147.8 million at Electronics.
    Resources’ revenue increased due to positive market
    fundamentals, acquisitions and improved operating efficiencies.
    Electronics’ revenue was impacted by the acquisition of two
    significant Components companies in the third quarter of 2005
    along with operating improvements in the core businesses.


Revenue would have increased 16% to $6,066.1 million, if
    2004 foreign currency translation rates were applied to 2005
    results. Acquisitions completed during 2005 contributed
    $209.3 million to revenue and contributed operating profit
    before purchase accounting write-offs of $32.6 million.
    Gross profit of $2,079.4 million in 2005 represented a 16%
    increase compared to $1,793.7 million in 2004, while gross
    profit margin remained essentially flat at 34.2% and 34.4%,
    respectively.

For the year, consolidated revenue growth was 16.5%, with 8.2%
    from organic growth and 8.1% from acquisitions. Earnings growth
    of 20% was generated by 13.8% of organic growth, with 6.4% from
    acquisitions. Selling and administrative expenses for 2005 were
    $1,378.9 million, or 22.7% of revenue, compared to
    $1,205.3 million or 23.1% of revenue in 2004. The increase
    in selling and administrative expenses included increases in
    compensation and pension benefits along with the impact of the
    2005 acquisitions. Operating earnings of $700.5 million for
    2005 increased $112.1 million compared to the prior year
    due primarily to the 17% increase in revenue, benefits from
    improved operating efficiencies and improved global economic
    conditions. Operating margin for 2005 and 2004 was essentially
    flat at 11.5% and 11.3%, respectively.

Net interest expense increased 17.8% to $72.2 million for
    2005, compared to $61.3 million for 2004. The primary
    reason for the increase in net interest expense was higher
    outstanding borrowings used to fund 2005 acquisitions.

Other (Income) Expense, net for 2005 of ($15.3) million was
    driven primarily by foreign exchange gains. Other (Income)
    Expense, net of ($1.6) million for 2004 included gains on
    dispositions, favorable settlements and miscellaneous credits of
    $9.5 million, which were largely offset by foreign exchange
    losses of $7.9 million.

The 2005 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 26.3%
    compared to 25.4% in 2004 and includes a $9.5 million
    U.S. tax provision related to the repatriation of
    $373.7 million of dividends, a $25.5 million benefit
    primarily related to the resolution of U.S. tax issues, and
    a $5.5 million first quarter benefit related to a favorable
    federal tax court decision. Excluding the repatriation
    provision, the full year 2005 effective tax rate for continuing
    operations was 24.8%. Dover expects the 2006 effective tax rate
    to be between 28% and 30% for continuing operations.

Earnings from continuing operations for 2005 were
    $474.5 million or $2.32 per diluted share compared to
    $394.2 million or $1.92 per diluted share from
    continuing operations in 2004. For 2005, net earnings were
    $510.1 million or $2.50 per diluted share, including
    $35.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share in earnings
    from discontinued operations, compared to $412.8 million or
    $2.02 per diluted share for 2004, which included
    $18.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share in earnings
    from discontinued operations. Refer to Note 7 in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
    discontinued operations.

Diversified’s revenue and earnings increases were driven by
    both the Industrial Equipment Group and the Process Equipment
    Group due to growth in the aerospace, defense, heat exchanger,
    and oil and gas markets.

Industrial Equipment’s revenue and earnings increased 27%
    and 17%, respectively, over the prior year. The revenue increase
    was driven primarily by strength in the aerospace and
    construction markets. The margin decrease resulted from
    unfavorable product mix and acquisition-related costs, partially
    offset by volume increases and moderating raw material pricing.
    The automotive and powersports business was down as gains from
    the North


American professional racing market were not enough to offset a
    weak powersports market. Bookings increased 23%, generating a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.08, and backlog increased 22%.

Process Equipment full-year revenue and earnings rose 19% and
    33%, respectively, and margin grew to over 15%, reflecting
    double digit revenue growth in all areas, and significant
    earnings and margin growth in the oil and gas market for
    bearings. In addition, overall growth was driven by the
    expanding HVAC markets for heat exchangers, as well as
    productivity gains. Bookings increased 20%, backlog grew 30%,
    and the

book-to-bill

ratio was 1.08.

The increase in both revenue and earnings at Electronics was
    primarily driven by the acquisition of two significant
    Components companies, Knowles Electronics and Colder Products,
    in the third quarter of 2005 and operating improvements within
    core businesses, although these gains were partially offset by
    decreases in Commercial Equipment and purchase accounting
    amortization.

Components operating earnings increased 128% in 2005 compared to
    the prior year on a 46% increase in revenue, reflecting the
    impact of the acquisitions, and revenue and earnings growth in
    almost all of the other Components businesses. The margin grew

    included $5.3 million of integration costs related to a
    2004 Vectron acquisition, which has essentially been completed.
    Bookings increased 57%, backlog grew 81%, and the

book-to-bill

ratio was 1.07.

Commercial Equipment full year revenue was flat, with earnings
    down 23% and a substantial decrease in margin, reflecting some
    market softness and the effect of Hurricane Katrina, which
    disrupted the ATM operations significantly in the third quarter
    of 2005. Bookings decreased 2%, backlog grew 23%, and the

book-to-bill

ratio was 1.01.

Revenue and earnings increases in Industries were driven
    primarily by the Mobile Equipment group, due to strong military
    sales and strength in environmental markets. Industries earnings
    increase was partially offset by a decrease at the Service
    Equipment group. Bookings and backlog both exceeded prior-year
    levels on improved strength in the environmental and military
    markets.

Strong military sales and strength in the oil field industry
    contributed to Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings increases
    of 15% and 45%, respectively, with significant margin
    improvement. Earnings were also positively impacted by a gain of
    approximately $1 million on the sale of a facility and cost
    control initiatives. Bookings increased 14% driven by strong
    demand for trailer and refuse products, generating a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.05 and a backlog increase of 15%.


Service Equipment revenue and margin were flat while earnings
    declined moderately, reflecting overall end market conditions
    and weakness in the automotive service industry. Earnings were
    negatively impacted by product mix, new product introduction
    costs, and a facility shutdown. Bookings were essentially flat,
    backlog increased 18% and the

book-to-bill

ratio was 1.01.

In 2005, Resources had record revenue, earnings, margin,
    bookings and backlog, reflecting positive market fundamentals,
    acquisitions and improved operating efficiencies.

Oil and Gas Equipment led the segment in 2005 with increases in
    revenue and earnings of 52% and 62%, respectively, due to
    continued robust demand for its energy-related products.
    Bookings increased by 49%, resulting in a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.03 and backlog increased 58%.

Fluid Solutions revenue and earnings increased 14% and 20%,
    respectively, due to strong refining, petrochemical, and
    transportation markets, partially offset by weakness in the
    retail petroleum markets. Bookings were up 12%, and backlog was
    up 6%, with a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.01.

Material Handling realized an increase in revenue of 14% while
    earnings, which included strategic realignment costs at one of
    the businesses grew 6%. The increase in revenue was driven by
    demand in the construction, crane, aerial lift, petroleum, and
    military markets, partially offset by slow demand from the
    automotive industry. Bookings were up 11%, and backlog was up
    20%, with a

Systems revenue and earnings increases were driven by both Food
    Equipment and Packaging Equipment, reflecting strength in the
    supermarket equipment and can machinery markets.

Food Equipment revenue increased 14% in 2005 compared to the
    prior year, due to higher supermarket and foodservice equipment
    sales, resulting in an earnings increase of 42%. Margin improved
    due to volume leverage, pricing initiatives and productivity
    gains. Bookings increased 13%, and backlog was up 26%, with a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.05.

Packaging Equipment revenue and earnings in 2005 increased 13%
    and 18%, respectively, over the prior year and margin rose
    80 bps due to strength in the can machinery market,
    particularly in Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East, driven
    by both new lines and can size conversions. The package closure
    business experienced continued weak market conditions in Western
    Europe, particularly Germany. The

Revenue and earnings increases in 2005 reflected strength in the
    product identification market, offset by costs of
    $8 million related to restructuring charges that are
    expected to have a positive impact on the segment’s future
    financial performance.

CAT revenue was essentially flat and earnings declined 24% in
    2005 compared to the prior year, reflecting restructuring
    charges of approximately $6 million, principally related to
    certain facility closures, and general sales declines, except at
    the screen printer and wave solder companies. The

book-to-bill

ratio was 1.04, bookings increased 4% and backlog increased 32%.

Product Identification and Printing (“PIP”) reported a
    revenue increase of 31%, while earnings increased 22%. The
    revenue and earnings increases were primarily attributable to
    the impact of the Datamax acquisition at the end of 2004,
    partially offset by approximately $2 million of
    restructuring costs, weakness in printing equipment markets and
    price competitiveness for marking equipment. The

book-to-bill

    backlog increased 5%.

    COMPARED WITH 2003

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Revenue for 2004 of $5,217.1 million was up
    $1,050.9 million or 25% from 2003, primarily driven by
    increases of $367.3 million at Technologies and
    $350.3 million at Resources. Technologies’ revenue was
    impacted by positive trends in the global electronics industry,
    particularly in the back-end semiconductor market, as well as
    expansion of the Chinese manufacturing capacity. Resources’
    revenue increased due to improved market conditions and the full
    year impact of the 2003 acquisition of Warn Industries.

Revenue would have increased 22% to $5,097.1 million if
    2003 foreign currency translation rates were applied to 2004
    results. Acquisitions completed during 2004 contributed
    $104.1 million to revenue and contributed gross profit of
    $38.6 million. Gross profit of $1,793.7 million in
    2004 represented a 26% increase compared to
    $1,426.3 million in 2003. The gross profit margin was
    essentially flat for both 2004 and 2003 at 34.4% and 34.2% as
    volume increases in 2004 were offset by rising commodity prices.

Selling and administrative expenses for 2004 were
    $1,205.3 million or 23.1% of revenue, compared to
    $1,003.2 million or 24.1% of revenue in 2003. The increase
    in selling and administrative expenses included the costs
    related to Sarbanes-Oxley requirements and increases in
    compensation and pension benefits. Operating earnings of
    $588.3 million for 2004 increased $165.3 million
    compared to the prior year due primarily to the 25% increase in
    revenue, benefits from the Company’s restructuring programs
    undertaken during 2002 and 2001, and slightly improved global
    economic conditions. Operating margin for 2004 was 11.3%
    compared to 10.2% for 2003.

Net interest expense decreased 2% to $61.3 million for
    2004, compared to $62.3 million for 2003. The primary
    reason for the decrease in net interest expense was income
    related to the Company’s outstanding interest rate swaps
    related to a portion of its long-term debt.

Other (Income) Expense, net, for 2004 was ($1.6) million
    and includes gains on dispositions, favorable settlements and
    miscellaneous credits of $9.5 million, which were largely
    offset by foreign exchange losses of $7.9 million. Other
    (Income) Expense, net, of $9.7 million for 2003 primarily
    related to foreign exchange losses of


$6.2 million. The foreign exchange losses in both 2004 and
    2003 primarily relate to the appreciation of the Euro against
    the U.S. dollar.

Dover’s effective 2004 tax rate for continuing operations
    was 25.4% compared to the 2003 rate of 23.0%. The low effective
    tax rate for both years is largely due to the continuing benefit
    from tax credit programs such as those for research and
    experimentation combined with the benefit from U.S. export
    programs, lower effective foreign tax rates from the utilization
    of net operating loss carry forwards and the recognition of
    certain capital loss benefits, which were higher in 2003.

Earnings from continuing operations for 2004 were
    $394.2 million or $1.92 per diluted share compared to
    $270.1 million or $1.33 per diluted share from
    continuing operations in 2003. For 2004, net earnings were
    $412.8 million or $2.02 per diluted share, including
    $18.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share in earnings
    from discontinued operations, compared to $292.9 million or
    $1.44 per diluted share for 2003, which included
    $22.8 million or $0.11 per diluted share in earnings
    from discontinued operations. Refer to Note 7 in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
    discontinued operations.

Diversified revenue and earnings increases were driven by both
    the Industrial Equipment Group and the Process Equipment Group.

Industrial Equipment revenue and earnings increased 23% and 34%,
    respectively, primarily due to the continued recovery of the
    commercial and defense aerospace markets, increased cab sales
    volumes with key customers in the construction/agriculture
    equipment markets, and the recovery of the automotive racing and
    powersports markets. Solid execution of performance improvement
    plans as well as the addition of new customers and improved
    operating efficiencies all contributed to the earnings and
    margin increases. Bookings increased 32%, generating a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.12, and backlog increased 33%.

Process Equipment revenue increased 15%, while earnings
    increased 21%, primarily due to the addition of new key
    customers for its color and ink control products, moving its
    customer base from small and medium size printers in the
    aftermarket to large printers and the high-end new press OEM
    market. In the heat pump and boiler markets, order activity was
    steady throughout the year, and production capacity was
    increased with both capital investments and productivity
    programs to meet the growing demand. Cost reduction activities
    and favorable currency rates also contributed to the earnings
    and margin increases. Bookings increased 23%, generating a

Electronics revenue and earnings growth in 2004 was primarily
    due to increases in the ATM business and the impact of
    acquisitions on the Components group.

Components revenue and earnings increases of 30% and 61%,
    respectively, were primarily due to acquisitions made at the end
    of 2003 and during 2004 as well as stronger demand from
    communication equipment customers, which peaked in the second
    quarter of 2004. Bookings increased 27% over the 2003 period,
    resulting in a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.00, and backlog increased 30%.

Commercial equipment revenue and earnings increased 26% and 16%,
    respectively, primarily due to increases in the ATM business in
    2004, which marked the transition from serving primarily low-end
    retail ATM markets to entering the mid to high-end market of
    major retail and financial institutions. Costs associated with
    these endeavors reduced margin. Orders finished strong with a
    bookings increase of 29%, resulting in a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.02, and backlog increased 97%, primarily due to
    strong demand in the ATM business.

Industries revenue and earnings increases reflected continued
    market share gains helped by considerable new product
    introductions in the Mobile Equipment group, which was the
    largest contributor to the revenue and earnings increases.

Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings were up 23% and 42%,
    respectively, over the prior year due to an increase in buying
    in municipal markets, increases in market share within the
    national account segment, and further penetration into the
    independent hauler segment. Recycling products had a strong year
    as baler sales increased behind new product introductions and
    product redesigns. The Mobile Equipment group increased its
    market share due in part to a large one-time order from a
    national account, by leveraging its broad product line, and by
    focusing engineering efforts on identifying customer needs.
    Bookings increased 10% over the 2003 period, resulting in a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.06, and backlog increased 21%.

Service Equipment revenue increased 15%, while earnings
    increased 7%. Much of the increase in revenue was due to new
    lower margin product categories introduced in the latter half of
    2003. Earnings were also hampered by escalating steel costs and
    pricing pressures from low-cost Asian car wash imports. Sales to
    major oil companies were up for the year, but investor sales
    were flat as hurricanes and heavy rain reduced near-term car
    wash volume and, therefore, made current investors reconsider
    their replacement and expansion plans for the year. Bookings
    increased 14% over the 2003 period, resulting in a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.01, and backlog increased 19%.

Resources 2004 revenue increased 37% while earnings increased
    60%, driven by strength in the Oil and Gas Equipment group and
    in the Material Handling group, which serves the construction
    equipment, mobile crane, recovery vehicle, and power sports
    markets.

Oil and Gas Equipment revenue increased 31% primarily due to an
    acquisition, as well as organic growth. Earnings increased 36%
    due to increased volume and strong gas compression and
    transmission markets in 2004, both in the OEM equipment and the
    maintenance and service sectors. Bookings increased 38% over the
    2003 period, resulting in a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.04, and backlog increased 212%.

Fluid Solutions 2004 revenue and earnings increased 14% and 30%
    respectively, when compared to 2003, primarily due to an
    increase in retail service station construction and remodeling,
    the opening of a new manufacturing facility in China, an
    expanded presence in Brazil, and stronger growth in the rail
    tank car market. The group’s earnings benefited from
    restructuring and consolidation initiatives in 2003, generating
    strong earnings leverage as a result of these initiatives.
    Bookings increased 15% over the 2003 period, resulting in a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.03, and backlog increased 37%.

Material Handling revenue and earnings increased 79% and 113%,
    respectively, which includes the results of Warn Industries,
    which was acquired in October 2003. The group achieved record
    revenue in power sports products, strong growth in its branded
    truck products, and continued growth in powertrain products
    driven by increased demand for light trucks and sport utility
    vehicles. Also, strong growth was achieved in robotics tooling
    and through major industrial catalog sales. These strengths were
    dampened by slow growth in the automotive tooling and work
    holding markets. The petroleum, military, construction
    equipment, and mobile crane markets rebounded in early 2004 and
    provided increased opportunities for growth and the business has
    been able to realize synergy in sales and engineering from prior
    acquisitions. Orders finished strong with a bookings increase of
    89%, resulting in a

Systems 2004 revenue was flat while 2004 earnings decreased by
    14% primarily due to weakness in the Food Equipment Group, which
    experienced slower market conditions and a rise in commodity
    costs.

Food Equipment revenue was essentially flat while earnings
    decreased 18%. Continued weakness in municipal spending
    negatively impacted the institutional equipment market for the
    third consecutive year. 2004 saw numerous chain restaurant
    new-store openings being delayed or put on hold. Despite slower
    overall market conditions and consolidations in the supermarket
    industry, revenue continued to grow through expansion of its
    customer base by


offering industry-leading product innovations and strong
    customer service. In addition, the group was heavily impacted by
    the rise in commodity costs, and a slowdown in new construction
    and remodels by two of its major customers. Bookings increased
    11% over the 2003 period, resulting in a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.06, and backlog increased 37%.

Packaging equipment revenue increased 4%, while earnings were
    essentially flat. Despite weakness in the German market and the
    result of a consolidating retail environment, international
    sales were strong driven by strength in Eastern Europe,
    primarily Russia, Poland, Romania, Hungary and the Baltic
    states. The U.S. business moderately increased amid
    continued pricing pressures. Earnings were negatively impacted
    by investments in product development,

start-up

costs associated with opening a new facility in the Czech
    Republic, and increases in commodity costs. Bookings increased
    15% over the 2003 period, resulting in a

Technologies revenue and earnings increases were due primarily
    to the continued recovery of the overall electronics industry,
    which commenced in 2003. Particularly strong was the mid-year
    activity in the back-end semiconductor markets. However, by the
    fourth quarter, the semiconductor and related markets had slowed
    significantly as did the level of Chinese contract
    manufacturers’ capital expenditures.

CAT experienced 42% revenue growth and 159% earnings growth in
    2004 compared to 2003. Most of this growth came from the
    companies serving the back-end semiconductor markets and from
    new technology requirements in solder paste management and
    soldering. In addition, the group acquired a test handling
    company Rasco GmbH in June 2004, which contributed to the
    overall growth in revenue and earnings. Revenue was also
    positively impacted by increased sales of circuit assembly
    feeders and strong market acceptance of selective soldering
    machines, and product breadth that addresses the specific needs
    of the North American, European and Asian markets. The memory,
    chip attach and special application segments also contributed to
    the revenue and earnings growth. Bookings increased 33% over the
    2003 period, resulting in a

book-to-bill

ratio of 0.98, and backlog increased 3%.

PIP reported a 17% increase in revenue and a 15% increase in
    earnings primarily due to its CIJ applications in primary
    packaging, and DOD and TTOL applications in secondary packaging
    and large character printing. CIJ unit volume for the year was
    at a record level although non-CIJ products were becoming an
    increasing percentage of the group’s business. In addition,
    during December, the group completed the acquisition of Datamax
    International, a Florida-based manufacturer of bar code
    printers, which was immaterial to the revenue and earnings of
    the group in 2004 due to the timing of the acquisition. In
    addition, the group experienced significant growth in label
    press orders, driven by the strength of the Euro, U.S. tax
    incentives and improvements in sales strategies. Bookings
    increased 18% over the 2003 period, resulting in a

book-to-bill

ratio of 1.01, and backlog increased 36%.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The Company’s consolidated financial statements and related
    public financial information are based on the application of
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates,
    assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of
    accounting principles that have an impact on the assets,
    liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These
    estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in
    the public disclosures of the Company, including information
    regarding


contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The Company
    believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting
    assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied.
    Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on
    a consistent basis throughout the Company. Primary areas where
    the financial information of Dover is subject to the use of
    estimates, assumptions and the application of judgment include
    the following areas:

•

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances
    are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, b) price is fixed or determinable,
    c) collectibility is reasonably assured, and
    d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where
    installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the
    installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of
    the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving
    non-essential installation obligations are those which can
    generally be completed in a short period of time at
    insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these
    installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases
    can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the
    installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the
    delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until
    installation is complete. In a limited number of revenue
    transactions, other post shipment obligations such as training
    and customer acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue
    recognition is deferred until the customer is obligated to pay,
    or acceptance has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized
    and earned when services are performed.

•

Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual
    operating companies based on estimates of losses related to
    customer receivable balances. Estimates are developed by using
    standard quantitative measures based on historical losses,
    adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases,
    evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The
    establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and
    assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable
    balances. Though Dover considers these balances adequate and
    proper, changes in economic conditions in specific markets in
    which the Company operates could have a material effect on
    reserve balances required.

•

Inventory for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries,
    including all international subsidiaries and the Technologies
    segment, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is
    stated at cost, determined on the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under
    certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the
    valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly
    value inventory. Technologies companies tend to experience
    higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly
    given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over
    relatively short periods of time.

•

Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves
    at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting
    principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs,
    require the use of estimates. Though Dover believes that these
    estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual
    results may be different than the estimated amounts.

•

Dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its
    balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles
    related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of
    these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and
    amortization lives involves significant judgments and the use of
    estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established
    accounting guidelines (including
    SFAS No. 142) for impairment also requires
    significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it
    relates to the identification of reporting units and the
    determination of fair market value. Dover’s assets and
    reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an
    annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of
    impairment exist. The Company believes that its use of estimates
    and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally
    accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions
    could potentially require adjustments to the valuations.

•

The valuation of Dover’s pension and other post-retirement
    plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are
    used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and
    assets/liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates,
    investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and
    mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in Dover’s
    pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with
    external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for
    Dover’s future pension obligations. Changes


in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially
    have a material impact on Dover’s pension expenses and
    related funding requirements. Dover’s expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on
    actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation.
    Dover’s discount rate assumption is determined by
    constructing a portfolio of bonds to match the expected benefit
    stream to be paid from the Company’s pension plans. The
    benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons
    and maturities, as well as interest on the excess cash flows
    from the bond portfolio.

•

Dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are
    reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets
    are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income
    streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are
    also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and
    international issues that are currently unresolved. The Company
    routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and
    believes that it is properly reserved. Valuations related to tax
    accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting
    regulations, changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in
    statutory tax rates, and the Company’s future taxable
    income levels.

•

Dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk
    management program. These accruals require the use of estimates
    and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate
    liability. The Company estimates losses under these programs
    using actuarial assumptions, Dover’s experience, and
    relevant industry data. Dover considers the current level of
    accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market
    conditions and Company experience.

•

Dover has established reserves for environmental and legal
    contingencies at both the operating company and corporate
    levels. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is
    required to quantify Dover’s ultimate exposure in these
    matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed
    on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to
    assure that Dover is properly reserved. Reserve balances are
    adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing
    issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging
    issues. While Dover believes that the current level of reserves
    is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these
    determinations.

•

The Company from time to time will discontinue certain
    operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if
    necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations
    to their estimated fair value less costs to sell. These
    estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds
    anticipated as a result of the sale. The adjustments to fair
    market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain
    or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the
    inability to sell an operation could potentially require future
    adjustments to these estimates.

New
    Accounting Standards

Effective January, 1 2006, Dover adopted SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which no longer permits
    the use of the intrinsic value method under Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25. Dover
    adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective
    method, which requires compensation expense to be recorded for
    all options granted after January 1, 2006, as well as the
    unvested portion of previously granted options. Compensation
    expense will be recorded on a straight line basis, generally
    over the explicit service period (3 years). For retirement
    eligible employees, SFAS No. 123(R) clarifies that the
    recognition of compensation expense should be over the period
    from the date of grant through the date the employee first
    becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide
    service. Dover’s accounting policy related to vesting will
    be changed to reflect these rules for retirement eligible
    employees concurrent with the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) in the first quarter of 2006. See
    Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information on the impact of adopting
    SFAS No. 123(R).

In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”
    (“SFAS 154”), which replaces APB No. 20
    “Accounting Changes,” and SFAS No. 3
    “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
    Statements.” SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the
    accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
    principle, and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting
    principles, as well as changes required by an accounting
    pronouncement in the unusual instance that it does not include
    specific transition provisions. Specifically, SFAS 154
    requires retrospective application to prior periods’


financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine
    the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the
    change. SFAS 154 does not change the transition provisions
    of any existing pronouncement. SFAS 154 is effective for
    Dover for all accounting changes and corrections of errors made
    beginning January 1, 2006.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47,
    “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations” (“FIN 47”), effective for
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. FIN 47
    clarifies that a conditional asset retirement obligation, as
    used in SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations,” refers to a legal obligation to
    perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 is
    effective for the Company no later than the end of 2005. The
    effect of FIN 47 was immaterial to Dover’s
    consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial
    position.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
    “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, An Amendment of APB
    No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions”
    (“SFAS 153”). The amendments made by
    SFAS 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of
    nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of
    the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the
    narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive
    assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of
    nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. The
    statement was effective for the Company beginning July 1,
    2005 and was applied prospectively. The effect of the adoption
    of SFAS 153 was immaterial to Dover’s consolidated
    results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
    “Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4”
    (“SFAS 151”). SFAS 151 requires that
    abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be
    excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred.
    The provisions of SFAS 151 are applicable to inventory
    costs incurred beginning January 1, 2006. The effect of the
    adoption of SFAS 151 was immaterial to Dover’s
    consolidated results of operations, cash flow and financial
    position.

Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information
    regarding the Company’s results as determined by GAAP, the
    Company also discloses non-GAAP information which management
    believes provides useful information to investors. Free cash
    flow, net debt, total capitalization, operational working
    capital, revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not
    financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a
    substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or
    equity, revenue and working capital as determined in accordance
    with GAAP and they may not be comparable to similarly titled
    measures reported by other companies. Management believes the
    (1) net debt to total capitalization ratio and
    (2) free cash flow are important measures of operating
    performance and liquidity. Net debt to total capitalization is
    helpful in evaluating the Company’s capital structure and
    the amount of leverage it employs. Free cash flow provides both
    management and investors a measurement of cash generated from
    operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay
    dividends, repay debt and repurchase Dover’s common stock.
    Reconciliations of free cash flow, total debt and net debt can
    be found above in this Item 7, Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis. Management believes that reporting operational
    working capital (also sometimes called “adjusted working
    capital”), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus
    inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure
    of the Company’s operational results by showing the changes
    caused solely by revenue. In addition, management believes that
    reporting operational working capital and revenue at constant
    currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a
    meaningful measure of the Company’s operational changes,
    given the global nature of Dover’s businesses. Management
    also believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which
    excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and
    acquisitions, provides a useful comparison of the Company’s
    revenue performance and trends between periods.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rates

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in
    interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of long-term
    fixed interest rate debt, interest rate swaps attached thereto,
    commercial paper borrowings and investments in


cash equivalents. Generally, the fair market value of
    fixed-interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall
    and decrease as interest rates rise. A 59 basis point increase
    or decrease in interest rates (10% of the Company’s
    weighted average long-term debt interest rate) would have an
    immaterial effect on the fair value of the Company’s
    long-term debt. Commercial paper borrowings are at variable
    interest rates, and have maturities of three months or less. A
    43 basis point increase or decrease in the interest rates (10%
    of the Company’s weighted average commercial paper interest
    rate) on commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial
    impact on the Company’s pre-tax earnings. All highly liquid
    investments, including highly liquid debt instruments purchased
    with an original maturity of three months or less, are
    considered cash equivalents. The Company places its investments
    in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limits
    the amount of exposure to any one issuer. A 40 basis point
    decrease or increase in interest rates (10% of the
    Company’s weighted average interest rate) would have an
    immaterial impact on the Company’s pre-tax income. As of
    December 31, 2005, the Company had two interest rate swaps
    outstanding, as discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. The Company does not enter into derivative
    financial or derivative commodity instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes.

Foreign
    Exchange

The Company conducts business in various foreign countries,
    primarily in Canada, Europe, Brazil, China and other Asian
    countries. Therefore, changes in the value of the currencies of
    these countries affect the Company’s financial position and
    cash flows when translated into U.S. Dollars. The Company
    has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements
    relative to its investment in foreign operations. As of
    December 31, 2005, the Company had not established a formal
    company-wide foreign-currency hedging program but may, from time
    to time, for a specific exposure, enter into fair value hedges.
    Certain individual operating companies that have foreign
    exchange exposure have established formal policies to mitigate
    risk in this area by using fair value

and/or

cash
    flow hedging. The Company has mitigated and will continue to
    mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of
    decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority
    of all costs are local-currency based. A change of 10% or less
    in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material
    effect on the Company’s financial position and cash flows.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on its assessment under the criteria set forth in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

,
    management concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles.

In making its assessment of internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2005, management has excluded
    those companies acquired in purchase business combinations
    during 2005, which included Avborne Accessory Group, Rostone,
    Fas-Co Coders, Inc., APG, C-Tech Energy Services Inc., Colder
    Products Company, Harbor Electronics, Inc., Knowles Electronics
    Holdings Inc., Compressor Valve Engineering, and the Epsilon
    Product Line. These companies are wholly-owned by the Company
    and their total revenue for the year ended December 31,
    2005 represents less than 4% of the Company’s consolidated
    total revenue for the same period and their assets represent
    less than 19% of the Company’s consolidated assets as of
    December 31, 2005.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.


REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Dover Corporation:

We have completed integrated audits of Dover Corporation’s
    2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
    Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    Financial Statements and Financial Statement
    Schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15 (a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Dover
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and
    2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. These financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method for computing
    depreciation in 2004.

Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting,” appearing under Item 9A, that
    the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
    Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management
    is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
    of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
    control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
    the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
    performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable


assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
    and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
    or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report of Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Epsilon
    Product Line, Compressor Valve Engineering, Knowles Electronics
    Holdings Inc., Harbor Electronics, Inc., Colder Products
    Company, C-Tech Energy Services Inc., APG, Fas-Co Coders, Inc.,
    Rostone (Reunion Industries), and Avborne Accessory Group, Inc.
    from its assessments of internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2005 because they were
    acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during
    2005. These companies are wholly owned by the Company and their
    total revenue and assets represent less than 4% and 19% of the
    Company’s consolidated total revenue and assets,
    respectively, as reflected in its financial statements for the
    year ended December 31, 2005.

DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Description
    of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Description
    of Business

Dover Corporation (“Dover” or the “Company”)
    is a multinational, diversified manufacturing corporation
    comprised of stand-alone operating companies which manufacture a
    broad range of specialized industrial products and sophisticated
    manufacturing equipment. The Company also provides some
    engineering, testing and other services, which are not
    significant in relation to consolidated revenue. Dover’s
    operating companies are based primarily in the United States of
    America and Europe. The Company reports its results in six
    segments: Diversified, Electronics, Industries, Resources,
    Systems and Technologies. For additional information on
    Dover’s segments, see Note 13.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
    The results of operations of purchased businesses are included
    from the dates of acquisitions. The assets, liabilities, results
    of operations and cash flows of all discontinued operations have
    been separately reported as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented.

We have revised our 2004 and 2003 statements of cash flows
    to separately disclose the operating and investing portions of
    the cash flows attributable to our discontinued operations. We
    had previously reported these amounts on a combined basis.

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform
    to the current year presentation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include
    allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, net realizable
    value of inventories, restructuring charges, valuation of
    goodwill, pension and post retirement assumptions, useful lives
    associated with amortization and depreciation of intangibles and
    fixed assets, warranty reserves, income taxes and tax valuation
    reserves, environmental reserves, legal reserves, insurance
    reserves and the valuations of discontinued assets and
    liabilities.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits
    and short-term investments which are highly liquid in nature and
    have original maturities at the time of purchase of three months
    or less.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable is composed principally of trade accounts
    receivable that arise primarily from the sale of goods or
    services on account and are stated at historical cost.
    Management evaluates accounts receivable at each operating
    company to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that will
    not be collected in the future and records the appropriate
    provision. The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a
    charge to operating expense and reduces accounts receivable. The
    estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based primarily on
    management’s evaluation of the aging of the accounts
    receivable balance, the financial condition of its customers,
    historical trends, and time outstanding of specific balances.
    Actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from
    management’s estimates due to changes in future economic,
    industry or customers’ financial conditions. For details


DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years
    ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, see
    Schedule II Valuation and Qualifying Accounts accompanying
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade
    receivables, accounts payable, notes payable and accrued
    expenses approximates fair value due to the short maturity of
    these instruments.

Inventories

Inventory for the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries,
    including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the
    lowerof cost, determined on the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is
    stated at cost, determined on the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment includes the cost of land,
    buildings, equipment and significant improvements to existing
    plant and equipment. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and
    minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When property or
    equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and
    accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts
    and the gain or loss realized on disposition is reflected in
    earnings. Depreciation expense was $131.4 million in 2005,
    $126.1 million in 2004, and $128.2 million in 2003.
    Plant and equipment was generally depreciated through
    December 31, 2003 based upon accelerated methods, utilizing
    estimated useful property lives. Building and leasehold
    improvement lives ranged from 5 to 50 years; and machinery
    and equipment lives ranged from 2 to 20 years. The Company
    changed to the straight-line method of depreciation for assets
    acquired on or after January 1, 2004, from various
    accelerated depreciation methods. Management’s decision to
    change was based on the fact that straight-line depreciation has
    become a better method of matching revenue and expenses over the
    estimated useful life of capitalized assets given their
    characteristics and usage patterns. The Company has determined
    that the design and durability of these assets does not diminish
    to any significant degree over time and it is therefore
    preferable to recognize the related cost uniformly over their
    estimated useful lives. The effect of the change for the twelve
    months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was an increase to
    net earnings of approximately $11.3 million and
    $8.2 million, net of tax, respectively, or $0.06 and
    $0.04 per diluted share, respectively.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company periodically enters into fair value and cash flow
    hedge transactions specifically to hedge its exposures to
    various items, including but not limited to interest rate and
    foreign exchange rate risk. The Company does not enter into
    derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and
    does not have a material portfolio of derivative financial
    instruments.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” and related amendments
    and interpretations, the Company recognizes all derivatives as
    either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures
    those instruments at fair value. If the derivative is designated
    as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair
    value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to
    the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period.
    If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portions of changes in the fair value of the
    derivative are recorded in other comprehensive earnings and are
    recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item
    affects income. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair
    value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

Tests for hedge ineffectiveness are conducted periodically and
    any ineffectiveness found is recognized in the statement of
    operations. The fair market value of all outstanding
    transactions is recorded in the Other assets and


DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

deferred charges, or Other deferrals section of the balance
    sheet, as applicable. The corresponding change in value of the
    hedged assets/liabilities is recorded directly in that section
    of the balance sheet.

During 2005, the Company entered into derivative contracts to
    hedge potential foreign currency exposure on current assets and
    liabilities. The contracts were designated as cash flow hedges
    and were considered by management to be highly effective. The
    derivative foreign exchange contracts settled during 2005 and
    resulted in a gain of approximately $0.6 million, which is
    recognized in Cost of Sales or Revenue.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had open foreign exchange
    forward purchase contracts, expiring through December 2006,
    related to hedges of foreign currency exposures as follows:

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses
    over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,” the Company does not amortize goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Instead, these assets
    are tested for impairment annually unless indicators of
    impairment exist. For 2005, the Company identified 17 reporting
    units for testing purposes. Step one of the test compared the
    fair value of the reporting unit (using a discounted cash flow
    method) to its book value. Step two, which compares the book
    value of the goodwill to its implied fair value, was not
    necessary since there were no indicators of potential impairment
    from step one. For information related to the amount of the
    Company’s goodwill by segment and intangible asset classes,
    see Note 6.

Long-Lived
    Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”

long-lived

assets (including intangible assets that are amortized) are
    reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. If an indicator of impairment exists for any
    grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash
    flows is produced and compared to its carrying value. If an
    asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the
    excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value
    as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.

Foreign
    Currency

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the
    functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have been
    translated at year-end exchange rates and profit and loss
    accounts have been translated using weighted average yearly
    exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from translation have been
    recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as
    cumulative translation adjustments. Assets and liabilities of an
    entity that are denominated in currencies other than an
    entity’s functional currency are remeasured into the
    functional currency using end of period exchange rates. Gains
    and losses related to these remeasurements are recorded within
    the Statement of Operations as a component of “Other
    (income) expense, net.”

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances
    are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, b) price is fixed or determinable,
    c) collectibility is reasonably assured, and
    d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where
    installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the
    installation


DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

obligation is not essential to the functionality of the
    delivered products. Revenue transactions involving non-essential
    installation obligations are those which can generally be
    completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and
    the skills required to complete these installations are not
    unique to the Company and in many cases can be provided by third
    parties or the customers. If the installation obligation is
    essential to the functionality of the delivered product, revenue
    recognition is deferred until installation is complete. In a
    limited number of revenue transactions, other post-shipment
    obligations such as training and customer acceptance are
    required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is deferred until
    the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance has been
    confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned when
    services are performed and are not significant to any period
    presented.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

For all years presented, Dover has accounted for stock-based
    compensation in accordance with Accounting Principals Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees,” and followed the disclosure only
    provisions of SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation.” Accordingly, no compensation
    expense has been recognized in connection with stock options
    granted to employees.

The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and
    basic and diluted earnings per share if the Company had
    recognized compensation expense upon grant of the options. The
    pro-forma amounts in this table were based on the explicit
    service periods (3 years) of the options granted without
    consideration of retirement eligibility:

Effective January 1, 2006, Dover adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
    Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”) which no
    longer permits the use of the intrinsic value method under APB
    No. 25. Dover adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the
    modified prospective method, which requires compensation expense
    to be recorded for all options granted after January 1,
    2006, and for the unvested portion of previously granted
    options. Compensation expense will be recorded on a
    straight-line basis, generally over the explicit service period
    (3 years). For retirement eligible employees,
    SFAS 123(R) clarifies that the recognition of compensation
    expense should be over the period from the date of grant through
    the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no
    longer required to provide service. Dover’s accounting
    policy related to vesting will be changed to reflect these rules
    for retirement eligible employees concurrent with the adoption
    of SFAS No. 123(R).

Had the Company applied this accounting for retirement eligible
    employees, stock-based compensation expense, net of tax
    benefits, would have been $18.0 million, $19.5 million
    and $18.7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We
    expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will impact the
    first quarter and full year 2006 by $0.03 and $0.10 per
    diluted share, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense in
    the first quarter will typically


DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

be higher than subsequent quarters due to the immediate
    expensing of options granted to retirement eligible employees.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of
    grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
    following assumptions:

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes on continuing operations includes
    federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Tax credits, primarily
    for research and experimentation and foreign earnings and export
    programs, are recognized as a reduction of the provision for
    income taxes on continuing operations in the year in which they
    are available for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are provided on
    temporary differences between assets and liabilities for
    financial and tax reporting purposes as measured by enacted tax
    rates expected to apply when temporary differences are settled
    or realized. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent
    that realization of those benefits is considered to be more
    likely than not. A valuation allowance is established for
    deferred tax assets for which realization is not assured. The
    Company has not provided for any residual U.S. income taxes
    on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such earnings
    are currently intended to be indefinitely reinvested.

During 2005, the Company recorded a net U.S. tax provision
    of $9.5 million related to the repatriation of
    $373.7 million of foreign dividends under the provisions of
    the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which provides for a
    favorable income tax rate on repatriated earnings, provided the
    criteria of the law are met.

Research
    and Development Costs

Research and development expenditures, including qualifying
    engineering costs, are expensed when incurred and amounted to
    $192.2 million in 2005, $181.4 million in 2004 and
    $151.5 million in 2003.

Risk,
    Retention, Insurance

The Company’s property and casualty insurance programs
    contain various deductibles that, based on our experience, are
    typical and customary for a company of our size. We do not
    consider any of the deductibles to represent a material risk to
    the Company. The Company generally maintains deductibles for
    claims and liabilities related primarily to workers’
    compensation, health and welfare claims, general commercial,
    product and automobile liability and property damage, and
    business interruption resulting from certain events. The Company
    accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and
    can be reasonably estimated. As part of the Company’s risk
    management program, insurance is maintained to transfer risk
    beyond the level of self-retention and provides protection on
    both an individual claim and annual aggregate basis. The Company
    currently self-insures its product and commercial general
    liability claims up to $5.0 million per occurrence, its
    workers’ compensation claims up to $0.5 million per
    occurrence, and automobile liability claims up to
    $1.0 million per occurrence. Third-party insurance provides
    primary level coverage in excess of these amounts up to certain
    specified limits. In addition, the Company has excess liability
    insurance from third-party insurers on both an aggregate and an
    individual occurrence basis well in excess of the limits
    discussed above. A worldwide program of property


DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

insurance covers the Company’s owned property and any
    business interruptions that may occur due to an insured hazard
    affecting those properties, subject to reasonable deductibles
    and aggregate limits.

New
    Accounting Standards

See “Stock-Based Compensation” above for a discussion
    of the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”
    (“SFAS 154”), which replaces APB No. 20
    “Accounting Changes,” and SFAS No. 3
    “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
    Statements.” SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the
    accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
    principle, and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting
    principles, as well as changes required by an accounting
    pronouncement in the unusual instance that it does not include
    specific transition provisions. Specifically, SFAS 154
    requires retrospective application to prior periods’
    financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine
    the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the
    change. SFAS 154 does not change the transition provisions
    of any existing pronouncement. SFAS 154 is effective for
    Dover for all accounting changes and corrections of errors made
    beginning January 1, 2006.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47,
    “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations” (“FIN 47”), effective for
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. FIN 47
    clarifies that a conditional asset retirement obligation, as
    used in SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations,” refers to a legal obligation to
    perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or
    method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 was
    effective for the Company in 2005 and was immaterial to
    Dover’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows or
    financial position.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
    “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, An Amendment of APB
    No. 29” (“SFAS 153”). The amendments
    made by SFAS 153 are based on the principle that exchanges
    of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value
    of the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the
    narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive
    assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of
    nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. The
    statement was effective for the Company beginning July 1,
    2005 and was applied prospectively. The effect of the adoption
    of SFAS 153 was immaterial to Dover’s consolidated
    results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
    “Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4”
    (“SFAS 151”). SFAS 151 requires that
    abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs be excluded
    from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. The
    provisions of SFAS 151 are applicable to inventory costs
    incurred beginning January 1, 2006. The effect of the
    adoption of SFAS 151 was immaterial to Dover’s
    consolidated results of operations, cash flow and financial
    position.

2.  Acquisitions

All of the Company’s acquisitions have been accounted for
    under SFAS No. 141 “Business Combinations.”
    Accordingly, the accounts of the acquired companies, after
    adjustments to reflect fair market values assigned to assets and
    liabilities, have been included in the consolidated financial
    statements from their respective dates of acquisitions. The 2005
    acquisitions are wholly-owned and had an aggregate cost of
    $1,091.8 million, net of cash acquired, at the date of
    acquisition. There is no contingent consideration related to the
    acquisitions at December 31, 2005.

    the third quarter of 2005, resulting in a goodwill and
    intangible impairment of approximately $55.0 million.


DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

On September 23, 2005, Dover, through its subsidiary Dover
    Diversified, Inc., entered into an agreement to sell Tranter PHE
    for approximately $150 million. The closing of the
    transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other
    customary closing conditions.

•

Koolant Koolers, a business in the Industries segment, was sold
    in December 2005, for a loss of $5.4 million
    ($3.5 million after tax) and the Company discontinued a
    minor business in the Resources segment in the Material Handling
    group.

During 2004, the Company discontinued and sold one business in
    the Technologies segment and sold five businesses that had been
    discontinued in 2003. In 2004, six businesses were disposed of
    or liquidated for a net after tax gain of $2.4 million.

During 2003, in connection with the completion of a federal
    income tax audit and the resolution of other issues, the Company
    adjusted certain reserves established in connection with the
    sales of previously discontinued operations and recorded a gain
    on the sales of discontinued operations, net of tax, of
    $16.6 million, and additional tax benefits of
    $5.1 million related to losses previously incurred on sales
    of businesses. These amounts were offset by charges of
    $13.6 million, net of tax, to reduce discontinued
    businesses to their estimated fair value, and a loss on the sale
    of discontinued operations, net of tax, of $6.0 million
    related to contingent liabilities from previously discontinued
    operations.

8.  Lines
    of Credit and Debt

On October 26, 2005, the Company closed a $1 billion

5-year

unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks
    that replaces the Company’s

5-year

$600 million facility. At the Company’s election,
    loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a
    Eurodollar or alternative currency rate based on LIBOR, plus an
    applicable margin ranging from 0.125% to 0.475% (subject to
    adjustment based on the rating accorded the Company’s
    senior unsecured debt by S&P and Moody’s), or at a base
    rate pursuant to a formula defined in the credit agreement. In
    addition, the Company will pay a facility fee and a utilization
    fee in certain circumstances as described in the Credit
    Agreement. The Credit Agreement imposes various restrictions on
    the Company that are substantially identical to those in the
    replaced facilities. Among other things, the credit agreement
    generally requires the Company to maintain an interest coverage
    ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less
    than 3.5 to 1. The Company primarily uses this facility to
    support its commercial paper program and has not drawn down any
    loans under the $1 billion facility and does not anticipate
    doing so. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had
    commercial paper outstanding in the principal amount of
    $174.4 million.

The Company established a Canadian Dollar Credit Facility in
    November 2002 with the Bank of Nova Scotia. Under the terms of
    this Credit Agreement, the Company has a Canadian (CAD)
    $30 million bank credit availability and has the option to
    borrow in either Canadian Dollars or U.S. Dollars (USD).
    The outstanding borrowings at year end under this facility were
    approximately $21 million (CAD) in 2005 and 2004. The
    covenants and interest rates under this facility match those of
    the primary $1 billion revolving credit facility. The
    Canadian Credit Facility was renewed for an additional year
    prior to its expiration date of November 22, 2005, and now
    expires on November 22, 2006. The Company intends to
    replace the Canadian Credit Facility on or before its expiration
    date. The primary purpose of this agreement is to facilitate
    borrowings in Canada to facilitate efficient cash and tax
    planning objectives.

On October 13, 2005, Dover issued $300 million of
    4.875% notes due 2015 and $300 million of
    5.375% debentures due 2035. The net proceeds of
    $588.6 million from the notes and debentures were used to
    repay borrowings under Dover’s commercial paper program.
    The notes and debentures are redeemable at the option of Dover
    in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price that
    includes a make-whole premium, with accrued interest to the
    redemption date. In November 2005, the Company retired its
    6.45% notes due November 15, 2005 with a face amount
    of $250.0 million. On November 25, 2005, the Company
    established a € 75 million credit facility with Credit
    Lyonnais. The interest rate on outstanding balances is 15 basis
    points over the Euribor rate and the annual


DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

commitment fee is 5 basis points on unborrowed amounts. The
    facility has no material covenants. At December 31, 2005,
    there was no outstanding balance under this facility.

Notes payable shown on the consolidated balance sheets for 2005
    and 2004 principally represented commercial paper issued in the
    U.S. The weighted average interest for short-term
    borrowings for the years 2005 and 2004 was 3.2% and 1.3%,
    respectively.

Dover’s long-term debt instruments had a book value of
    $1,345.4 million on December 31, 2005 and a fair value
    of approximately $1,406.0 million. On December 31,
    2004, the Company’s long-term debt instruments had a book
    value of $1,005.7 million and a fair value of approximately
    $1,093.0 million.

The Company may, from time to time, enter into interest rate
    swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes.
    Interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange fixed and
    variable rate payments based on notional principal amounts.

During the third quarter 2005, Dover entered into several
    treasury rate locks related to the notes and debentures that
    were issued on October 13, 2005. The contracts were settled
    on October 13, 2005 and the resulting gain of

$3.0 million is being deferred in Other comprehensive
    earnings and amortized over the life of the related notes and
    debentures.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had two interest rate
    swaps outstanding for a total notional amount of
    $100.0 million, designated as fair value hedges of the
    $150.0 million 6.25% Notes due on June 1, 2008.
    One $50 million interest rate swap exchanged fixed-rate
    interest for variable-rate interest. The other $50 million
    swap is designated in foreign currency and exchanges fixed-rate
    interest for variable-rate interest, and also hedges a portion
    of the Company’s net investment in foreign operations. The
    swap agreements reduced the effective interest rate on the notes
    to 5.12%. There was no hedge ineffectiveness as of
    December 31, 2005, and the aggregate fair value of these
    interestrate swaps of $0.9 million was determined through
    market quotation and is reported in Other assets and deferred
    charges, and Other comprehensive earnings.

9.  
    Stock Option and Performance Incentive Program

On April 25, 1995, the stockholders approved the 1995
    Incentive Stock Option Plan and 1995 Cash Performance Program
    (the “1995 Plan”) to replace the 1984 Incentive Stock
    Option and 1984 Cash Performance Program, which expired on
    January 30, 1995. Under the 1995 Plan, a maximum aggregate
    of 20 million shares was reserved for grants to key
    personnel until January 30, 2005. The option price could
    not be less than the fair market value of the stock at the time
    the options were granted. The period during which these options
    were exercisable was fixed by the Company’s Compensation
    Committee at the time of grant, but could not commence sooner
    than three years after the date of grant and could not exceed
    ten years from the date of grant.

On April 20, 2004, the stockholders approved the Dover
    Corporation 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2005
    Plan”) to replace the 1995 Plan, which expired on
    January 30, 2005. Under the 2005 Plan, a maximum aggregate
    of 20 million shares is reserved for grants (non-qualified
    and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights settled
    in stock (“SSARs”), and restricted stock) to key
    personnel between February 1, 2005 and January 31,
    2015, provided that no incentive stock options shall be granted
    under the plan after February 11, 2014 and a maximum of one
    million shares may be granted as restricted stock. The exercise
    price of options and SSARs may not be less than the fair market
    value of the stock at the time the awards are granted. The
    period during which these options and SSARs are exercisable is
    fixed by the Company’s Compensation Committee at the time
    of grant, but may not commence sooner than three years after the
    date of grant and may not exceed ten years from the date of
    grant.

The Company also has a restricted stock program (as part of the
    1995 Plan and the 2005 Plan), under which common stock of the
    Company may be granted at no cost to certain officers and key
    employees. In general, restrictions limit the sale or transfer
    of these shares during a two or three year period, and
    restrictions lapse proportionately over the two or three year
    period. Restricted shares granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
    6,000, 4,000, and 6,000, respectively.

In addition, the Company has a stock compensation plan under
    which non-employee directors are granted shares of Dover’s
    common stock each year as more than half of their compensation
    for serving as directors. During 2005, the Company issued an
    aggregate of 12,860 shares of its common stock to ten
    outside directors (after withholding an aggregate of 3,790
    additional shares to satisfy tax obligations), as partial
    compensation for serving as directors of the Company during
    2005. During 2004, the Company issued an aggregate of
    9,120 shares of its common stock to eight outside directors
    (after withholding an aggregate of 3,904 additional shares to

The Company has loss carryovers for federal and foreign purposes
    as of December 31, 2005 of $46.3 million and
    $184.5 million, respectively, and as of December 31,
    2004 of $50.8 and $243.7 million, respectively. The 2005
    federal loss carryover relates to Knowles’ estimated
    pre-acquisition losses which are available for use against the
    Company’s consolidated federal taxable income. The Company
    utilized $50.8 million of the 2004 federal loss carryover
    in the 2001 carryback period. The entire balance of the foreign
    losses is available to be carried forward, with
    $66.5 million of these losses beginning to expire during
    the years 2006 through 2012. The remaining $118.0 million
    of such losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
    Knowles’ pre-acquisition foreign tax credit carryovers of
    $26.4 million are available for use by the Company between
    2007 and 2015. The Company maintains valuation allowances by
    jurisdiction against the deferred tax assets related to these
    carry forwards, as utilization of these tax benefits is not
    assured for certain jurisdictions.

The Company has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes
    or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings of its
    international subsidiaries because such earnings are reinvested
    and it is currently intended that they will continue to


DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

be reinvested indefinitely. At December 31, 2005, the
    Company has not provided for federal income taxes on earnings of
    approximately $98.7 million from its international
    subsidiaries.

On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”). The Act creates a
    temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
    accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent
    dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
    controlled foreign corporations. During the second half of 2005,
    the Company recorded a net U.S. tax provision of
    $9.5 million related to the repatriation of
    $373.7 million of foreign dividends under the provisions of
    the Act.

During 2005, the Company recognized a $25.5 million tax
    benefit, primarily related to the resolution of U.S. tax
    issues, including $5.5 million related to a favorable tax
    court decision.

Dover is continuously undergoing examination of its federal
    income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (the
    “IRS”). The Company and the IRS have settled tax years
    through 1997. The Company expects to resolve open years in
    litigation

(1998-2002)

in the near future, all within the amounts paid

and/or

reserved for these liabilities. The IRS is currently examining
    the Company’s 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns.
    Additionally, the Company is routinely involved in state and
    local income tax audits, and on occasion, foreign jurisdiction
    tax audits.

11.

Commitments
    and Contingent Liabilities

A few of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal
    proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites
    identified under Federal and State statutes which provide for
    the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible
    parties.” In each instance, the extent of the
    Company’s liability appears to be very small in relation to
    the total projected expenditures and the number of other
    “potentially responsible parties” involved and is
    anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few
    of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing
    remedial activities at certain plant sites, in cooperation with
    regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been
    established.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to
    a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their
    businesses. These proceedings primarily involve claims by
    private parties alleging injury arising out of use of the
    Company’s products, exposure to hazardous substances or
    patent infringement, litigation and administrative proceedings
    involving employment matters, and commercial disputes.
    Management and legal counsel periodically review the probable
    outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably
    expected to be incurred, the availability and extent of
    insurance coverage, and established reserves. While it is not
    possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal
    actions or any need for additional reserves, in the opinion of
    management, based on these reviews, it is very unlikely that the
    disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned
    above will have a material adverse effect on the financial
    position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive
    position of the Company.

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
    operating leases, many of which contain renewal options. Total
    rental expense, net of insignificant sublease rental income, on
    all operating leases was $61.1 million, $42.5 million
    and $41.7 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
    Contingent rentals under the operating leases were not
    significant.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company has defined benefit and defined contribution pension
    plans (the “Plans”) covering substantially all
    employees of the Company and its domestic and international
    subsidiaries. The defined benefit plans’ benefits are
    generally based on years of service and employee compensation.
    The Company’s funding policy is consistent with the funding
    requirements of ERISA and applicable foreign law. Dover uses a
    measurement date of September 30th for the majority of its
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

The Company is responsible for overseeing the management of the
    investments of the defined benefit Plans’ assets and
    otherwise ensuring that the Plans’ investment programs are
    in compliance with ERISA, other relevant legislation, and
    related plan documents. Where relevant, the Company has retained
    professional investment managers to manage the Plans’
    assets and implement the investment process. The investment
    managers, in implementing their investment processes, have the
    authority and responsibility to select appropriate investments
    in the asset classes specified by the terms of their applicable
    prospectus or investment manager agreements with the Plans.

The primary financial objective of the Plans is to secure
    participant retirement benefits. Accordingly, the key objective
    in the Plans’ financial management is to promote stability
    and, to the extent appropriate, growth in funded status. Related
    and supporting financial objectives are established in
    conjunction with a review of current and projected Plan
    financial requirements.

The assets of the Plans are invested to achieve an appropriate
    return for the Plans consistent with a prudent level of risk.
    The asset return objective is to achieve, as a minimum over
    time, the passively managed return earned by market index funds,
    weighted in the proportions outlined by the asset class
    exposures identified in the Plans’ strategic allocation.


DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Expected Return on Asset Assumption used for pension expense
    was developed through analysis of historical market returns,
    current market conditions, and the past experience of plan asset
    investments. In developing the Expected Return on Asset
    Assumption, estimates of future market returns by asset category
    are less than actual long-term historical returns in order to
    best anticipate future experience. Overall, it is projected that
    the investment of Plan assets will achieve an 8.5% net return
    over time, from the asset allocation strategy.

Dover’s discount rate assumption is determined by
    constructing a portfolio of bonds to match the expected benefit
    stream to be paid from the Company’s pension plans. The
    benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons
    and maturities, as well as interest on the excess cash flows
    from the bond portfolio.

The Company also provides, through non-qualified plans,
    supplemental retirement benefits in excess of qualified plan
    limits imposed by Federal tax law. These plans are funded from
    the general assets of the Company.

Dover has reflected the acquisition of the Knowles Electronics
    Holdings Inc. defined benefit plan and its liabilities,
    effective September 27, 2005. In accordance with purchase
    accounting rules, the unfunded Pension Benefit Obligation
    (“PBO”) as of the merger date was $96.2 million
    along with related plan assets of $68.5 million. Subsequent
    to the acquisition date of the defined benefit plan, Dover made
    a contribution of $18.0 million in the third quarter of
    2005.

During 2003, two plan amendments created an increase in the
    benefit obligations of the Company’s principal
    non-qualified supplemental pension benefit plan. A change in
    early retirement factors under the supplemental benefit plan
    allows for employees who are 62 and have 10 years of
    service with the Company to retire with unreduced benefits
    between the ages of 62 and 65. The second amendment provides
    partial prior service credit to executives who are hired at or
    after age 40 and are eligible to participate in this plan.

Pension cost for all defined contribution and defined benefit
    plans was $53.7 million for 2005, $39.3 million for
    2004, and $28.4 million for 2003.

For post-retirement benefit measurement purposes, an 11% annual
    rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits
    (i.e., health care cost trend rates) was assumed for 2006; the
    rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 4.50% by the year
    2013 and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost
    trend rate assumption can have an effect on the amounts
    reported. For example, increasing (decreasing) the assumed
    health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each
    year would increase (decrease) the accumulated post-retirement
    benefit obligation as of December 31, 2005, by
    $1.4 million ($1.4 million) and the net
    post-retirement benefit cost for 2005 by approximately
    $0.1 million ($0.1 million).

The post-retirement benefit plans cover approximately 2,200
    participants, approximately 825 of whom are eligible for medical
    benefits. The plans are closed to new entrants. The
    post-retirement benefit obligation amounts for 2005 and 2004
    include approximately $6 million in obligations recorded in
    discontinued operations.

Segment
    Data

On January 1, 2005, the Company realigned its segment
    structure from four to six segments. All years presented have
    been conformed to the current year presentation.


DOVER
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Dover identifies its operating segments through the underlying
    management reporting structure related to its operating
    companies and through commonalities related to products,
    processes, distribution,

and/or

markets served. The Company’s segment structure allows the
    management of each segment to focus its attention on particular
    markets and provide oversight capacity to acquire additional
    businesses.

Dover’s six reportable segments are briefly described below:

Diversified builds sophisticated products for use in the
    defense, aerospace and automotive industries, heat transfer
    equipment, specialized bearings, construction and agricultural
    cabs, as well as color measurement and control systems for
    printing presses.

Electronics manufactures advanced micro-component products for
    the hearing aid and consumer electronics industries, quick
    disconnect couplings for a wide variety of biomedical and
    commercial applications, high frequency capacitors,
    microwave electro-magnetic switches, radio frequency and
    microwave filters, electromagnetic products, and frequency
    control/select components. In addition, this segment
    manufactures ATM hardware and software for retail and financial
    institutions and chemical proportioning and dispensing systems
    for the food service, health care, supermarket, industrial and
    other various markets.

Industries makes equipment and components for use in waste
    handling, bulk transport, automotive service, and construction
    equipment industries.

Resources manufactures products primarily for the automotive,

Revenue is attributed to regions based on the location of the
    Company’s customer, which in some instances is an
    intermediary and not necessarily the end user. Long-lived assets
    are comprised of net property, plant and equipment.

The Company’s operating companies are based primarily in
    the United States of America and Europe. Dover’s businesses
    serve thousands of customers, none of which accounted for more
    than 10% of consolidated revenue. Accordingly, it is
    impracticable to provide revenue from external customers for
    each product and service sold by segment.

Changes

    Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31,
    2005 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
    Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
    Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and
    communicated to the Company’s management, including its
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure. During the fourth quarter of 2005, there were no
    changes in the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
    likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations Over Internal Controls

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that:

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that the Company’s receipts and
    expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of the Company’s management and
    directors; and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Management’s report on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the
    Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all
    errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
    are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
    the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
    of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
    of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance
    that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have
    been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those
    internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company has three compensation plans under which equity
    securities of the Company have been authorized for issuance and
    have been issued to employees and to non-employee directors.
    These plans are described below. The table above does not
    reflect shares eligible for issuance under the 1996 Non-Employee
    Directors’ Stock Compensation Plan, which does not specify
    a maximum number of shares issuable under it.


The
    1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan and 1995 Cash Performance
    Program

The Company’s 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan and 1995
    Cash Performance Program (the “1995 Plan”), adopted in
    1995 (replacing the 1984 Plan which expired in January 1995),
    provided for stock options, restricted stock awards and cash
    performance awards. The 1995 Plan expired in January 2005, but
    Column A of the table above includes options that remain
    outstanding under it.

The 1995 Plan was intended to promote the medium-term and
    long-term success of Dover by providing salaried officers and
    other key employees of Dover and its subsidiaries with
    medium-range and long-range inducements to remain with Dover and
    to encourage them to increase their efforts to make Dover
    successful. Options granted under the 1995 Plan were all
    designated as non-qualified stock options.

The exercise price of options is the fair market value on the
    date of grant as determined in good faith by the Compensation
    Committee. Options granted under this plan may not be sold,
    transferred, hypothecated, pledged or otherwise disposed of by
    any of the holders except by will or by the laws of descent and
    distribution except that a holder may transfer any non-qualified
    option granted under this plan to members of the holder’s
    immediate family, or to one or more trusts for the benefit of
    such family members provided that the holder does not receive
    any consideration for the transfer.

The information above summarizes the material aspects of the
    1995 Plan. The rights and obligations of participants are
    determined by the provisions of the plan document itself.

The
    2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan

The Company’s 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the
    “2005 Plan”) was approved by the shareholders of the
    Company on April 20, 2004. The 2005 Plan became effective
    on February 1, 2005, and replaced the 1995 Plan, which
    expired on January 30, 2005, and is intended to allow the
    Company to continue to provide to key personnel the types of
    rewards available under the 1995 Plan. Participation in the 2005
    Plan is limited to a group of salaried officers and other key
    employees of Dover and its subsidiaries who are in a position to
    affect materially the profitability and growth of the Company
    and its subsidiaries and on whom major responsibility rests for
    the present and future success of the Company. The Board of
    Directors and management believe that the 2005 Plan will provide
    these key employees with medium-range and long-range inducements
    to remain with Dover and to encourage them to increase their
    efforts to make Dover and its subsidiaries successful. The 2005
    Plan provides for stock option grants, grants of stock
    appreciation rights settled in stock (“SSARs”) and
    restricted stock and cash incentive awards. Options granted
    under the 2005 Plan may be either non-qualified stock options or
    incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422
    of the Internal Revenue Code. Options and SSARs will have a term
    not exceeding ten years and will become exercisable after not
    less than three years. The option and SSAR exercise price will
    be fixed by the Compensation Committee and may be equal to or
    more than (but not less than) the “fair market value”
    of a share of Dover common stock on the date the option or SSAR
    is granted. No single recipient may be granted options or SSARs
    for more than 600,000 shares in any year. Stock options are
    not transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and
    distribution, except for non-qualified options which may be
    transferred to members of the holder’s immediate family (or
    a trust for the benefit of one or more of such family members),
    but such transferred options cannot be further transferred by
    the transferee during the transferee’s lifetime. SSARs are
    non-transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and
    distribution.

The information above summarizes material aspects of the 2005
    Plan. The rights and obligations of participants are determined
    by the provisions of the plan document itself.

    1996 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Compensation
    Plan

The Dover Corporation 1996 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock
    Compensation Plan (the “Directors’ Plan”)
    provides the majority of the compensation to non-employee
    directors of the Company for their service as directors. Under
    the Directors’ Plan, Directors receive annual compensation
    in an amount set by the Board, payable partly in cash and partly
    in Dover’s common stock, subject to adjustment by the Board
    of Directors of the compensation amount and allocation, and the
    Directors’ Plan’s limitations on the maximum number of
    shares that may be granted to any Director in any year (10,000).
    Annual compensation for 2004 was $90,000, payable 25% in cash
    and 75% in


common stock, and was paid by $22,500 in cash and
    1,628 shares, based on the fair market value of common
    stock on November 15, 2004. On November 4, 2004, the
    Board of Directors approved the recommendations of its
    Compensation Committee to (1) increase the annual
    compensation of non-employee directors from $90,000 to $120,000,
    effective January 1, 2005, and (2) decrease the
    percentage of such compensation paid in stock from 75% to 60%,
    with a corresponding increase in the amount of such compensation
    paid in cash from 25% to 40%. Annual compensation for 2005 was
    $120,000, payable 40% in cash and 60% in common stock, and was
    paid by $48,000 in cash and 1,800 shares, based on the fair
    market value of Dover’s common stock on November 15,
    2005. If any Director serves for less than a full calendar year,
    the Compensation Committee will prorate the Director’s
    compensation for the year (including the number of shares to be
    granted) as the Committee deems appropriate. The shares granted
    under the Directors’ Plan may be treasury shares or newly
    issued shares, but in either case they will be listed on the New
    York Stock Exchange.

The information above summarizes the material aspects of the
    Directors’ Plan. The rights and obligations of participants
    are determined by the provisions of the plan document itself.
