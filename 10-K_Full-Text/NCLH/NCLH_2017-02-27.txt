PART I

Item 1. Business

History and Development of the Company

NCLH is a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian
Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. We have 24 ships with approximately 46,500 Berths and plan to
introduce eight additional ships through 2025 with an option to introduce two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027.

Norwegian commenced operations from Miami in 1966. In February 2000,
Genting HK acquired control of and subsequently became the sole owner of the Norwegian operations.

In January 2008, the Apollo Holders acquired 50% of the outstanding
ordinary share capital of NCLC. As part of this investment, the Apollo Holders assumed control of NCLC’s Board of Directors.
Also, in January 2008, the TPG Viking Funds acquired, in the aggregate, 12.5% of NCLC’s outstanding share capital from the
Apollo Holders.

In January 2013, NCLH completed its IPO, pursuant to which it sold
27,058,824 ordinary shares for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses, of approximately
$473.9 million.

In November 2014, we completed the Acquisition of Prestige. We believe
that the combination of Norwegian and Prestige creates a cruise operating company with a rich product portfolio and strong market
presence.

The Sponsors have completed numerous Secondary Equity Offerings
and as of December 31, 2016 have reduced their ownership to 29.4% of NCLH’s ordinary shares.

Corporate Reorganization

In February 2011, NCLH, a Bermuda limited company, was formed with
the issuance to the Sponsors of, in aggregate, 10,000 ordinary shares, with a par value of $.001 per share. In connection with
the consummation of the IPO, the Sponsors’ ordinary shares in NCLC were exchanged for the ordinary shares of NCLH, and NCLH
became the owner of 100% of the ordinary shares and parent company of NCLC (the “Corporate Reorganization”). At the
same time, NCLH contributed $460.0 million to NCLC and the historical financial statements of NCLC became those of NCLH. The Corporate
Reorganization was effected solely for the purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure. NCLH had not, prior to the completion
of the Corporate Reorganization, conducted any activities other than those incidental to its formation and to prepare for the Corporate
Reorganization and the IPO.

NCLC was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
and the terms of the partnership (including the economic rights with respect thereto) were set forth in an amended and restated
tax agreement for NCLC. Economic interests in NCLC were represented by the partnership interests established under the tax agreement,
which we refer to as “NCL Corporation Units.”

In connection with the Corporate Reorganization, NCLC’s outstanding
profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement to management (or former management) of NCLC were exchanged for an
economically equivalent number of NCL Corporation Units. We refer to the NCL Corporation Units exchanged for profits interests
granted under the profits sharing agreement as Management NCL Corporation Units. As a result of the Corporate Reorganization, the
Management NCL Corporation Units created a non-controlling interest within NCLH. The Management NCL Corporation Units received
upon the exchange of outstanding profits interests were subject to the same time-based vesting requirements and performance-based
vesting requirements applicable to the profits interests for which they were exchanged. The Management NCL Corporation Units issued
in exchange for the profits interests represented a 2.7% economic interest in NCLC as of the consummation of the IPO.

Subject to certain procedures and restrictions (including the vesting
schedules applicable to the Management NCL Corporation Units and any applicable legal and contractual restrictions), each holder
of Management NCL Corporation Units had the right to cause NCLC and NCLH to exchange the holder’s Management NCL Corporation
Units for ordinary shares of NCLH at an exchange rate equal to one ordinary share for every Management NCL Corporation Unit (or,
at NCLC’s election, a cash payment equal to the value of the exchanged Management NCL Corporation Units), subject to customary
adjustments for stock splits, subdivisions, combinations and similar extraordinary events.

When a holder of a Management NCL Corporation Unit exchanged such
unit for one of NCLH’s ordinary shares (or a cash payment equal to the value of one of such ordinary shares), the relative
economic interests of the exchanging NCL Corporation Unit holder and the holders of ordinary shares of NCLH were not altered. As
a result of the Corporate Reorganization, a non-controlling interest was created within NCLH and NCLH’s financial statements
and financial results differed from NCLC’s in certain respects.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, all Management NCL Corporation Units
were exchanged for NCLH ordinary shares and restricted shares. NCLH became the sole member and 100% owner of the economic interests
in NCLC and the non-controlling interest no longer exists. Accordingly, NCLC is now treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. No new NCLC profits



interests or Management NCL Corporation Units will be issued; however,
NCLH has granted, and expects to continue to grant, equity to its employees and members of its Board of Directors under its long-term
incentive plan.

Our Company

Business Overview

We are a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian
Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. We have 24 ships with approximately 46,500 Berths. We plan
to introduce eight additional ships through 2025 and we have an option to introduce two additional ships for delivery in 2026
and 2027. Norwegian Joy, a ship tailored for Chinese travelers, is on order for delivery in the spring of 2017. Norwegian Bliss
and an additional Breakaway Plus Class Ship are on order for delivery in the spring of 2018 and fall of 2019. We have an Explorer
Class Ship on order for delivery in the winter of 2020. Project Leonardo consists of four ships on order with expected delivery
dates through 2025 with an option for two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027, subject to certain conditions. These
additions to our fleet (exclusive of the option for two additional ships) will increase our total Berths to approximately 72,100.
Our brands offer itineraries to worldwide destinations including Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Africa,
Canada, Bermuda, Caribbean, Alaska and Hawaii. Norwegian’s U.S.-flagged ship, Pride of America, provides the industry’s
only entirely inter-island itinerary in Hawaii.

All of our brands offer an assortment of features, amenities and
activities, including a variety of accommodations, multiple dining venues, bars and lounges, spa, casino and retail shopping areas
and numerous entertainment choices. All brands also offer a selection of shore excursions at each port of call as well as hotel
packages for stays before or after a voyage.

Norwegian is an innovator in cruise travel with 14 ships that have
been purpose-built to consistently deliver the “Freestyle Cruising” product, which offers freedom, flexibility and
choice to our guests who prefer to dine when they want, with whomever they want and without having to dress formally. Certain ships
in Norwegian’s fleet offer The Haven by Norwegian (“The Haven”), a luxurious, key-card access enclave that has
spacious accommodations with suites as large as 1,345 square feet and offers a “ship within a ship” experience. The
Haven includes two decks of suites, a private pool with multiple hot tubs and sundeck, a private fitness center and steam rooms,
fine dining in a private restaurant, casual outdoor dining, 24-hour concierge service and personal butlers. The additional ships
that we plan to add to our fleet as part of Project Leonardo will introduce additional innovative features that we believe will
further elevate the guest experience. Norwegian Cruise Line has been named “North America’s Leading Cruise Line”
for the first time, along with being honored as the “Caribbean’s Leading Cruise Line” for the fourth consecutive
year and World’s Leading Large Ship Cruise Line for the fifth straight year at the 2016 World Travel Awards. In 2016, Norwegian
also received awards for “Europe’s Leading Cruise Line” for the ninth consecutive year, “Europe’s
Responsible Tourism Award” for the second consecutive year and the award for “World’s Best Cruise Spa”
for the Mandara Spa® on board Norwegian Cruise Line.

Oceania Cruises offers the finest cuisine at sea and immersive destination
experiences with destination-rich itineraries spanning the globe. Oceania Cruises operates a fleet of six mid-size ships, including
two 1,250-Berth O-Class ships, and four 684-Berth R-Class ships. Oceania Cruises is ranked as one of the world’s best cruise
lines by Condé Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure. Oceania Cruises’ ships received “Best in Cuisine,”
from Cruise Critic Cruisers’ Choice Awards in 2016 and 2015, “Best Public Rooms” and “Best Cabins”
from Cruise Critic Cruisers’ Choice Awards in 2015,“Best Food” from Travel Weekly - Readers’ Choice Awards
and “Best Dining” from 2016 Town & Country Cruise Awards.

Regent Seven Seas Cruises is an all-inclusive cruise line which
provides all-suite accommodations, round-trip air transportation, highly personalized service, acclaimed cuisine, fine wines and
spirits, Wi-Fi, sightseeing excursions in every port and other amenities included in the cruise fare. The brand operates four award-winning

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that the following business strengths will enable us
to execute our strategy:

Rich Stateroom Mix

The Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent fleets offer an attractive
mix of staterooms, suites and villas. Norwegian’s accommodations include the groundbreaking Studio staterooms designed for
solo travelers centered around the Studio Lounge, a private lounge area solely for Studio guests, as well as ocean views, balconies,
and connecting accommodations to meet the needs of all types of cruisers. Norwegian’s suites range from two bedroom family
suites to penthouses and owner suites, as well as three bedroom Garden Villas measuring up to 6,694 square feet. In addition, eight
of Norwegian’s ships offer The Haven, a key-card access enclave on the upper decks with luxurious suite accommodations, exclusive
amenities, and 24/7 butler and concierge service. The Haven suites surround a private courtyard with pool, hot tubs, sundeck, fitness
center and steam rooms. Onboard Norwegian Epic and Breakaway Class Ships, The Haven also includes a private lounge and fine dining
restaurant. Norwegian Escape, the newest and first



of the Breakaway Plus Class Ships, offers the largest Haven complex
to date with new outdoor fine dining providing expansive ocean views. The spacious and elegant accommodations on Oceania Cruises’
six award-winning ships, the 684-Berth Regatta, Insignia and Nautica, and the 1,250-Berth Marina and Riviera, range from
160-square foot inside staterooms to opulent 2,030-square foot Owner’s Suites. Oceania Cruises added a fourth 684-Berth ship
with Sirena being placed in service in the spring of 2016. The Regent fleet is comprised of four ships — Seven Seas Voyager
and Seven Seas Mariner feature all-suite, all-balcony accommodations; Seven Seas Navigator has accommodations with a majority including
balconies; and Seven Seas Explorer, delivered in the summer of 2016, features all-suite, all-balcony accommodations with sophisticated
designer suites ranging from 300 to 4,443 square feet that are amongst the highest space-to-guest and crew-to-guest ratios in the
industry.

High-Quality Service

The Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent brands all offer a high
level of onboard service. We collaborate amongst the brands to provide an enhanced guest experience across all brands. Norwegian
offers Freestyle Cruising with numerous dining venues. Oceania Cruises and Regent are known for their quality of service, including
some of the highest crew-to-guest ratios in the industry and a staff trained to deliver personalized and attentive service in a
country club, casual setting.

Diverse Selection of Premium Itineraries

We have expanded our already broad range of premium itineraries.
Our fleet has a worldwide deployment, offering one to 180-day itineraries, including destinations in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean,
the Greek Isles, Alaska, Canada and New England, Asia, Tahiti and the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, Africa, India,
South America, the Panama Canal, and the Caribbean. We introduced a new destination, Harvest Caye, in November 2016. This destination
in Southern Belize features Belize’s only cruise ship pier, expansive seven acre white sand beach, 15,000 sq. ft. pool with
swim up bar, multiple dining options and a nature center with wildlife experiences plus adventure tours.

Strong Cash Flow

We believe our business model will generate a significant amount
of cash flow with high revenue visibility. All three of our brands afford the ability to pre-sell tickets, receive customer deposits
and sell onboard activities in advance with long lead times ahead of sailing. In terms of newbuild capital expenditures, the cash
flow impact is mitigated by export credit financing for all newbuild ships expected to be delivered through 2025 to fund approximately
80% of the contract price of each ship.

Highly Experienced Management Team

Our senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive
experience in the cruise, travel, leisure and hospitality-related industries. Frank J. Del Rio is our President and Chief Executive
Officer of NCLH. He has been successful in leading the integration of Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent brands. Prior to this,
he has been responsible for the financial and strategic development of Prestige. Mr. Del Rio founded Oceania Cruises in October
2002 and played a vital role in the development of Renaissance Cruises from 1993 to 2001. Andrew Stuart is our President and Chief
Executive Officer of our Norwegian brand. Mr. Stuart joined Norwegian in 1988 and has held several Senior Management positions
in Sales, Marketing and Passenger Services during his tenure before becoming President and Chief Executive Officer. Robert Binder
is our Vice Chairman for the Oceania Cruises and Regent brands and President and Chief Executive Officer, Oceania Cruises brand
and Jason M. Montague is our President and Chief Executive Officer for the Regent brand. Mr. Binder and Mr. Montague were instrumental
in launching Oceania Cruises in 2002 and are widely regarded as its co-founders. Wendy Beck is our Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Beck has been with NCLH since 2010 and was instrumental in consummation of the IPO. For more on our
senior management, see “Executive Officers” below.

Our Business Strategies

Driving Demand

We seek to attract vacationers to our products and services in several
ways, including:

·

delivering an enhanced, value-added vacation experience to our guests relative to other vacation alternatives via our market-to-fill
strategy;

·

creating diverse and unique itineraries in new and existing markets for our current and upcoming ships;

·

utilizing effective marketing and sales force initiatives; and

·

expanding internationally.



Our market-to-fill strategy, itinerary diversification, marketing
and sales force initiatives and international expansion strategies contribute to driving increased revenues for our fleet.  Our
market-to-fill strategy maintains pricing integrity by offering both the best price early in the booking cycle and value-added
promotions when necessary to mitigate the need to compromise on price.

Diversification of deployment is achieved by our destination management
team which reviews deployments across the fleet, either repositioning ships to new destinations or fine-tuning itineraries, with
the goal of creating scarcity which, in turn, leads to higher pricing.

We also seek to increase demand through effective marketing campaigns
across various channels such as branding campaigns on nationwide television or targeted mail campaigns aimed at supporting seasonal
deployments. Our sales forces are also drivers of demand, particularly in terms of educating travel agents on our products and
services in order for them to better sell to potential vacationers.

Lastly, our international expansion efforts are aimed at increasing
brand awareness across the globe.  We maintain numerous sales offices which support sales and marketing efforts in various
markets outside of North America including the United Kingdom, Europe, China, Australia, Brazil, India, Japan and Singapore. 
We are also growing our deployment footprint by positioning our upcoming ship, Norwegian Joy, to sail year round voyages from China
in a product designed for Chinese guests.

Leveraging Scale to Suppress Costs

We continue to leverage the combined purchasing power of our three
brands to reduce costs throughout the organization.  This initiative is bolstered by our Supply Chain and Logistics Management
function which supports our three brands as well as our corporate and international offices.

Enhanced Product Offerings and Guest Experience

Norwegian’s ships offer up to 28 dining options, a diverse
range of accommodations and what we believe is the widest array of entertainment at sea. Oceania Cruises’ award-winning onboard
dining, with multiple open seating dining venues, is a central highlight of its cruise experience. Regent’s all-inclusive
offering includes air transportation, shore excursions, hotel packages, specialty restaurants, premium spirits and fine wines,
gratuities, wi-fi and other amenities.

Maximize Revenue

We focus on growing revenue through various initiatives aimed at
increasing ticket prices and Occupancy Percentages as well as onboard spending to drive higher overall revenue. Our specific initiatives
include:

Strategic Relationships.

We have strategic relationships
with travel agencies and tour operators who commit to purchasing a certain level of inventory with long lead times.

Meetings, Incentives and Charters.

We maintain
our focus on the meetings, incentives and charters channel, which typically books very far in advance and can represent a significant
portion of the ship, or even an entire sailing, in one transaction.

Promotional Strategy.

With our Norwegian brand,
we utilize a more inclusive product offering on certain sailings and in certain cabin selections which provides guests a choice
of one to five onboard amenities.

Casino Player Strategy.

We have non-exclusive arrangements
with over 100 casino partners worldwide whereby loyal gaming guests are offered cruise reward certificates redeemable for cruises.
Through property sponsored events and joint marketing programs, we have the opportunity to market cruises to these guests. These
arrangements with casino partners have the dual benefit of filling open inventory and reaching guests expected to generate above
average onboard revenue through the casino and other onboard spending.

Optimization of Deployment.

We manage our ships’
deployment to promote better breadth of itineraries and to offer sailings further in advance.

Disciplined Fleet Expansion

We have Norwegian Joy, Norwegian Bliss and one additional Breakaway
Plus Class Ship on order for delivery in the spring of 2017, spring of 2018 and the fall of 2019, respectively. These ships will
be the largest in our fleet, each reaching approximately 164,600 Gross Tons. With approximately 3,770 to 4,000 Berths
each, they will be similar in design to our first Breakaway Plus Class Ship, Norwegian Escape, which was delivered in October
2015 and will include additional innovative features. We also have a contract to build a second Explorer Class Ship to be delivered
in the winter of 2020. Project Leonardo consists of four ships on order with



expected delivery dates through 2025 with an option for two additional
ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027, subject to certain conditions. These four ships are each 140,000 gross tons with approximately
3,300 Berths. We have obtained export credit financing for the ships to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship
expected to be delivered through 2025, subject to certain conditions. We believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding
the reach of our brands, positioning us for accelerated growth and providing an optimized return on invested capital.

Expand and Strengthen Our Product Distribution Channels

As part of our growth strategy, we continually look for ways to
deepen and expand our sales channels. We continue to invest in our brands by enhancing websites and passenger services departments
through which travel agents and guests have the ability to book cruise vacations.

We focus on distribution through our three primary channels: “Retail/Travel
Agent,” “International,” and “Meetings, Incentives and Charters.”

Retail/Travel Agent.

The retail/travel agent channel
represents the majority of our ticket sales. Our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately 23,000
independent travel agencies including brick and mortar, internet-based and home-based operators located in North America, South
America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. We have made substantial investments with improvements in booking technologies, transparent
pricing strategies, effective marketing tools, improved communication and cooperative marketing initiatives. We have expanded sales
force teams who work closely with our travel agency partners on maximizing their marketing and sales effectiveness across all three
of our brands. Our focused account management is designed to create solutions catered to the individual retailer through product
and sales training. This education creates a deeper understanding of all our offerings.

International.

We continue to accelerate our international
expansion efforts, building on initiatives rolled out in 2015 that focused on increasing our presence in the fast growing Asia
Pacific region. We announced the re-deployment of Norwegian Star and later Norwegian Jewel to the Australasia region, along with
the opening of our sales office in Sydney, Australia which services the growing demand from the Asia Pacific region for cruises
across our three brands.

Our entry into the Chinese market includes a multi-pronged
strategy to expand our presence in what we believe is positioned to become the world’s second largest cruise market. We began
with the opening of sales and marketing offices in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong that will serve dual purposes. These offices
will look to source Chinese guests for international cruises across our three brands, which together combine to form a broad portfolio
of voyages and itineraries to every corner of the globe that a Chinese cruiser would look to sail. These offices will support our
travel partners to source locally for our China-dedicated venture, Norwegian Joy, being launched in the spring of 2017, which will
be purpose-built for Chinese consumers. The ship will be designed to deliver a blend of the Norwegian brand’s offering of
freedom and flexibility with amenities and features that will resonate with Chinese guests.

For information regarding risks associated with our international
operations, see Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor titled “Conducting
business internationally may result in increased costs and risks.”

Meetings, Incentives and Charters.

This channel
focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meetings and incentive travel. These sales often have very long lead times and
can fill a significant portion of the ship’s capacity, or even an entire sailing, in one transaction. The acquisition of
Sixthman in 2012, a company specializing in developing and delivering music-oriented charters, opened up a new market for travel
partners enabling travel partners to sell high-quality music experiences at sea to guests.

Itineraries

We offer cruise itineraries ranging from one to 180-days calling
on worldwide locations, including destinations in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, the Greek Isles, Alaska, Canada and New
England, Asia, Tahiti and the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, Africa, India, South America, the Panama Canal, and the
Caribbean. We have developed, and are continuing to develop, innovative itineraries to position our ships in new and niche markets
as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the Americas and Europe.

We believe that these destination-focused itineraries, complemented
by a comprehensive shore excursion program (which is included in the all-inclusive fare for cruises on the Regent ships), differentiate
our brands from many of our competitors. We call on varied destinations, many of which include overnight stays in port, allowing
guests to have more in-depth experiences than would otherwise be possible in only a single day port call.

For some of our longer itineraries, we strive to maximize profitability
by selling segments of the longer itineraries as shorter cruises (i.e., which last 7 to 20 days) in order to capture more time-constrained
customers. We believe the deployment flexibility created by the use of longer itineraries translates off-peak seasons into more
profitable portions of longer cruises.



We have bolstered our presence internationally by opening sales
offices in Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo and Mumbai which will further increase sourcing from these source
markets for all three brands.

In addition to expanding our international sourcing efforts, we
are in the process of deploying our vessels to new destinations around the world. Norwegian Star and Norwegian Jewel will homeport
year-round in the Asia Pacific region with itineraries that include many of the region’s ports.

Additionally, all three of our brands have received approval from
the government of the Republic of Cuba to operate cruises to the island beginning in 2017. These historic sailings will begin in
March 2017, and offer U.S. travelers the opportunity to visit the culturally and historically rich country on select Caribbean
sailings that include calls in the historic city of Havana through December 2017.

Passenger Ticket Revenue

We offer our guests a wide variety of cruise fare options when booking
a cruise. Our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities, including
meals and entertainment. In some instances, cruise ticket prices include round-trip airfare to and from the port of embarkation,
complimentary beverages, unlimited shore excursions and pre-cruise hotel packages. Prices vary depending on the particular cruise
itinerary, stateroom category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place.

Onboard and Other Revenue

All three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional
products and services which are not included in the cruise fare, including casino operations, certain food and beverage, gift shop
purchases, spa services, photo services and other similar items. Food and beverage, casino operations and shore excursions are
generally managed directly by us while retail shops, spa services, art auctions and some internet services may be managed through
contracts with third-party concessionaires. These contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage for the gross sales derived
from these concessions. Norwegian’s ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations, meals in certain dining facilities
and many onboard activities such as entertainment, pool-side activities and various sports programs. Norwegian generates additional
revenue on our ships from casino operations, food and beverage, shore excursions, gift shop purchases, spa services, photo services
and other similar items. To maximize onboard revenue, Norwegian uses various cross-marketing and promotional tools which are supported
by point-of-sale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these products and services. Oceania Cruises’
offerings may include air transportation and certain other amenities. Regent’s offerings typically include air transportation,
a pre-cruise hotel night stay (for concierge level and above), premium wines and top shelf liquors, gratuities and unlimited shore
excursions. Both Regent and Oceania Cruises generate additional revenue from casino operations, gift shop purchases, premium shore
excursions and spa services.

Onboard and other revenue accounted for 30%, 28% and 30% of our
consolidated revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Revenue Management Practices

Our revenue management function performs extensive analyses in order
to determine booking history and trends by sailing, stateroom category, travel partner, market segment, itinerary and distribution
channel in order to determine cruise ticket pricing. We concentrate on improving early booking occupancy rates to drive higher
Net Yields. We execute targeted and high-frequency marketing campaigns that communicate a message of a value-packed cruise offering
in both North American and select international markets. To increase the effectiveness of these targeted marketing programs, we
emphasize communication to keep the travel agents engaged and informed and utilize call centers focusing on both inbound calls
and outbound calls to high potential targeted customers. This marketing strategy assists in maximizing the revenue potential from
each customer contact generated by various marketing campaigns. We believe these strategies and other initiatives executed by our
distribution channels will drive sustainable growth in the number of guests carried and in Net Yields achieved.

Seasonality

Our revenue is seasonal and based on the demand for cruises. Historically,
the seasonality of the North American cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the Northern
Hemisphere’s summer months. This predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in our revenue
and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled
Dry-docks, which we typically schedule during non-peak demand periods.

Competition

Our primary competition includes operators such as Carnival Corporation
& Carnival plc, which owns and operates Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises and Seabourn Cruise Line,
among others, and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which



owns and operates Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises
and Azamara Club Cruises, among others, as well as other cruise lines such as Crystal Cruises, Silversea Cruises and Viking Ocean
Cruises. In addition, we compete with land-based vacation alternatives, such as hotels and resorts, vacation ownership properties,
casinos, and tourist destinations throughout the world.

Sales of cruises and onboard offerings are subject to consumer discretionary
spending levels and may be influenced by geopolitical events and economic conditions generally.

Marketing Strategy

Our marketing teams work to enhance brand awareness and increase
levels of understanding and consideration of our products and services among consumers and trade and travel partners with the ultimate
goal of driving sales. We utilize a multi-channel strategy that may include a combination of print, television, radio, website/e-commerce,
direct mail, social media, mobile and e-mail campaigns, partnerships, customer loyalty initiatives, market research, and business-to-business
events.

Building customer loyalty among our past guests is an important
element of our marketing strategy. We believe that attending to the needs and motivations of our past guests creates a cost-effective
means of attracting business, particularly to our new ships and itineraries, because past guests are familiar with our brands,
products and services and often return to cruise with us. We have shared customer databases across our brands to further enhance
our communications with our past guests who receive newsletters and mailings with informative destination and product information
and promotional amenities. Continued investments in our websites is also key to ensuring the optimal pre-cruise planning experience
offering guests the ability to shop, reserve and purchase a breadth of onboard products and services. We have a strong communications
stream that provides customized pre-cruise information to help guests maximize their cruise experience as well as a series of communications
to welcome them home and ultimately engage them in booking another cruise.

Travel agents are crucial to our marketing and distribution efforts.
We provide robust marketing support and enhanced tools for our travel agent partners through a variety of programs. Our travel
partners can benefit from our online travel partner education programs that include a wide variety of courses about our ships,
itineraries and other best-selling practices. Agents can also easily customize a multitude of consumer marketing materials for
their use in promoting our products through our online platform.

Guest feedback is also a critically important element in the development
of our overall marketing and business strategies. We regularly initiate guest feedback studies among both travel partners and consumers
to assess the impact of various programs and/or to solicit information that helps shape future direction.

Ship Operations and Cruise Infrastructure

Ship Maintenance and Logistics

Sophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support
the technical superiority and modern look of our fleet. In addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing
basis and in accordance with applicable requirements, each of our ships is generally taken out of service, approximately every
24 to 60 months, for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work, repairs and improvements performed in Dry-dock.
Dry-dock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under IMO requirements reflected in chapters of the International Convention
of the Safety of Life at Seas (“SOLAS”) and to some extent the International Load Lines Convention. Under these regulations,
it is required that a passenger ship Dry-dock once in five years (depending on age of vessel), twice in 5 years (depending on flag
state and age of vessel) and the maximum interval between each Dry-dock cannot exceed 3 years (depending age of vessel and flag
state). However, most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the Bahamas and/or Marshall Islands
(flag state), as applicable, after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to Dry-dock once every 5 years.
To the extent practical, each ship’s crew, catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the Dry-dock period and assist
in performing repair and maintenance work. Accordingly, Dry-dock work is typically performed during non-peak demand periods to
minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service. Dry-docks are typically scheduled in spring
or autumn and depend on shipyard availability.

Suppliers

Our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition.
Our largest operating expenditures are for payroll and related (including our contract with a third party who provides certain
crew services), fuel, food and beverage, advertising and marketing and travel agent services. Most of the supplies that we require
are available from numerous sources at competitive prices. In addition, owing to the large quantities that we purchase, we can
obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies. Our purchases are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. Payment terms granted
by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry.

Crew and Staff

Best-in-class guest service levels are paramount in the markets
in which we operate, where travelers have discriminating tastes and high expectations for service quality. We have dedicated increasing
attention and resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests. Among other initiatives,
we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs, with a focus on career development. We believe that our dedication to anticipating
and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew,
helping to build customer loyalty.



We place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew.
We operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of SOLAS and International Management Code for the Safe Operation
of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (“ISM Code”), the international safety standards which govern the cruise industry.
Every crew member is well trained in the Company’s stringent safety protocols, participating in regular safety trainings,
exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships.

Our captains are experienced seafarers. We further ensure that our
captains regularly undergo rigorous training on navigation and bridge operations. To assist our captains and officers while at
sea, we have extensive navigation protocols in place. Our bridge operations are based on robust navigational procedures and risk
analysis. Our bridge teams follow pre-set voyage plans which are thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team
prior to port departures and arrivals. In addition, all of our ships employ the latest state-of-the-art navigational equipment
and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have the most accurate data regarding the planned itinerary.

Prior to every cruise setting sail or upon departure, we hold a
mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated. We also show an extensive
safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions. Our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire
prevention and control systems. In recent years, our ships have continuously been upgraded and include internal and external regulatory
audits.

We have developed Safety Management Systems (“SMS”),
which establish policies, procedures, training, qualification, quality, compliance, audit and self-improvement standards for all
employees, both shipboard and shoreside. SMS also provides real-time reports and information to support the fleet and risk management
decisions. Through these systems, our senior managers, as well as ship management, can focus on consistent, high quality operation
of the fleet. Our SMS are approved and audited regularly by our classification society, Lloyds Register, and they also undergo
regular internal audits as well as annual/semiannual inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard, flag state and other port and state authorities.
We screen and train our crew to ensure crew familiarity and proficiency with the safety equipment onboard. Various safety measures
have been implemented on all of our ships and additional personnel have been appointed in our ship operations departments.

Insurance

We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, which
are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship. The coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies
is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the European and U.S. insurance markets.

In addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery
of our ships, we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels
to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business. The insurance we carry includes:

·

Protection and indemnity insurance (coverage for passenger, crew and third-party liabilities), including insurance against risk of pollution liabilities;

·

War risk insurance, including terrorist risk insurance. The terms of our war risk policies include provisions where underwriters can give seven days’ notice to the insured that the policies will be cancelled in the event of a change of risk which is typical for policies in the marine industry. Upon any proposed cancellation the insurer shall, before expiry of the seven day period, submit new terms; and

·

Insurance for our shoreside property and general liability risks.

We believe that all of our insurance coverage, including those noted
above, is subject to market-standard limitations, exclusions and deductible levels.

The Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and
Their Luggage by Sea (1974) (the “Athens Convention”) and the Protocol to the Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage
of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea (1976) (the “1976 Protocol”) are generally applicable to passenger ships. The
U.S. has not ratified the Athens Convention; however, with limited exceptions, the 1976 Protocol may be contractually enforced
with respect to cruises that do not call at a U.S. port. The IMO Diplomatic Conference agreed to a new protocol to the Athens Convention
on November 1, 2002 (the “2002 Protocol”). The 2002 Protocol, which took effect on April 23, 2014, establishes
for the first time a level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators with a right of direct
action against the insurer. In addition, on December 31, 2012, the European Union (“EU”) Passenger Liability Regulation
became effective and requires us to carry a minimum level of financial responsibility per passenger per incident. We believe the
amount of our protection and indemnity policy coverage provides the compulsory insurance; however, no assurance can be given that
affordable and secure insurance markets will remain available to provide the level and type of coverage required.

Trademarks

Under the Norwegian brand, we own a number of registered trademarks
relating to, among other things, the names “NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE,” “FEEL FREE,” “CRUISE LIKE A NORWEGIAN,”
the names of our ships (except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending), incentive programs and
specialty services rendered on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “THE HAVEN BY NORWEGIAN.” In addition,
we own registered trademarks relating to the



“FREESTYLE” family of names, including, “FREESTYLE
CRUISING,” “FREESTYLE DINING” and “FREESTYLE VACATION.” We believe that these trademarks are widely
recognized throughout North America, Europe and other areas of the world and have considerable value.

Under the Oceania Cruises brand, we own a number of registered trademarks
relating to, among other things, the names “OCEANIA CRUISES” and its logo, “REGATTA,” “INSIGNIA,”
and “YOUR WORLD. YOUR WAY.”

Under the Regent brand, we own registered trademarks relating to,
among other things, the names “SEVEN SEAS CRUISES,” those of our ships and “LUXURY GOES EXPLORING.” We
also claim common law rights in trade names used in conjunction with our ships, incentive programs, customer loyalty program and
specialty services rendered onboard our ships.

The Regent ships have been operating under the Regent brand since
2006. We entered into a trademark license agreement with Regent Hospitality Worldwide, Inc., which we amended in February 2011,
granting us the right to use the “Regent” brand family of marks. The amended trademark license agreement allows Regent
to use the Regent trade name, in conjunction with cruises, in perpetuity, subject to the terms and conditions in the agreement.

Regulatory Issues

Registration of Our Ships

Sixteen of the ships that we currently operate are registered in
the Bahamas. One of our ships, Pride of America, is a U.S.-flagged ship. Seven of our ships are registered in the Marshall Islands.
Our ships registered in the Bahamas and the Marshall Islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to Bahamian and Marshall
Islands requirements and are subject to International laws and regulations and to various U.S. federal regulatory agencies, including,
but not limited to, the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. Our U.S.-registered ship is subject to laws and regulations
of the U.S. federal government, including, but not limited to, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Coast
Guard and U.S. Department of Labor. The international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and other legal requirements
applicable to our operations change regularly, depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited.

Our ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities
in the various countries that they visit. Such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety, security,
environmental, customs, immigration, health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements.

Environmental Protection

Our ships are subject to various international, national, state
and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those that govern air emissions, waste discharge,
water management and disposal, and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals, solvents and paints. Under such
laws and regulations, we are prohibited from discharging certain materials, such as petrochemicals and plastics, into waterways,
and we must adhere to various air quality-related requirements.

The International Maritime Organization’s convention entitled
Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”) specifies requirements for Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”)
with stricter limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas. Ships operating in the Baltic Sea ECA, the North Sea/English Channel
ECA, the North American ECA and the U.S. Caribbean Sea ECA are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 0.1%
or use approved alternative emission reduction methods. Other additional ECAs may also be established in the future, with areas
around Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, the Mediterranean Sea and Mexico being considered.

The MARPOL global limit on fuel sulfur content, established
by the IMO, when vessels are outside of ECAs will be reduced to 0.5% from the current 3.5% global limit beginning January 2020.
The 0.5% global limit was reviewed to determine the availability of fuel oil to comply with this standard. This review
took into account supply and demand in the global fuel oil market, an analysis of trends in fuel oil markets and other relevant
issues. The result of the review, was to confirm the date of implementation as January 2020. The European Union Parliament
and Council has set January 2020 as the final date for the 0.5% fuel sulfur limit to enter force prior to the IMO review.

Starting September 8, 2017, the MARPOL Ballast Water Management
Convention (“The Convention”) will govern the discharge of ballast water from ships. Ballast water, which is seawater
held onboard ships and used for stabilization, can contain a variety of marine species. The Convention is designed to regulate
the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species to new, different, or potentially unsuitable
environments.

Recently adopted amendments to MARPOL will make the Baltic Sea a
“Special Area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be prohibited. Stricter discharge restrictions are
currently in effect for new passenger ships whose construction began after January 1, 2016, and for existing passenger ships starting
in 2018. The underlying requirements may impact our operations unless



suitable port waste facilities are available, or new technologies
for onboard waste treatment are developed. Accordingly, the cost of complying with these requirements is not determinable at this
time.

In the U.S., the Clean Water Act of 1972, and other laws and regulations,
provide the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental
discharges of ballast water, bilge water, gray water, anti-fouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a
vessel is on inland waters, within three nautical miles of land, and in designated federally protected waters. The U.S. National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”), authorized by the Clean Water Act, was established to reduce pollution
within U.S. territorial waters. For our affected ships, all of the NPDES requirements are set forth in the EPA’s Vessel General
Permit (“VGP”). The VGP establishes effluent limits for 27 specific discharges incidental to the normal operation of
a vessel. In addition to these discharge and vessel specific requirements, the VGP includes requirements for inspections, monitoring,
reporting and recordkeeping.

The U.S. Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, which implements the
MARPOL, provides for severe civil and criminal penalties related to ship-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within
three nautical miles of land and, in some cases, within the 200-nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”).

The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) provides
for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200-nautical mile EEZ of the U.S., subject to defined
monetary limits. OPA 90 requires that in order for us to operate in U.S. waters, we must have Certificates of Financial Responsibility
(“COFR”) from the U.S. Coast Guard for each ship that operates in these waters.  Our continued OPA 90 certification
signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related OPA 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous
substance.

Many coastal U.S. states have also enacted environmental regulations
that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance.
These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law and in some cases have no statutory limits of liability. The State of Alaska
enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored
to verify compliance with the established standards. The legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could
be prohibited from operating in Alaskan waters.

The European Union (“EU”) has adopted a substantial
and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at improving the quality of the environment. To support the implementation and
enforcement of European environmental legislation, the EU has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as
well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections.

With regard to air emissions from seagoing ships, the European Commission’s
(“EC”) strategy is to require the use of low sulfur (less than 0.1%) marine gas oil in EU ports. Passenger ships on
regular service to EU ports are required to use fuels containing a maximum sulfur content of 1.5%.

In addition to the existing legal requirements, we are committed
to helping to preserve the environment, because a clean, unspoiled environment is a key element that attracts guests to our ships.
Furthermore, NCL (Bahamas) Ltd. and NCL (America) LLC are certified under the International Organization for Standardization’s
14001 Standard. This voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental
management system which we have adopted for our operations. Currently we operate under an Environmental Management System that
is incorporated into the Company’s SMS.

If we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws, regulations
or treaties, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other
expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws, regulations and treaties. Any fines or other sanctions for violation or
failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, cash flow or financial condition.

Permits for Glacier Bay, Alaska

In connection with certain Alaska cruise operations, we rely on
concession permits from the U.S. National Park Service to operate our ships in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. We currently
hold a concession permit allowing for 22 calls per summer cruising season through September 30, 2019. However, there can be
no assurance that such permit will be renewed when necessary or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permit will remain
unchanged in the future.

Passenger Well-Being

In the U.S., we must meet the U.S. Public Health Service’s
requirements, which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the Vessel Sanitation Program of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (“CDC”) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We rate at the top of the range
of CDC and FDA scores achieved by the major cruise lines. In addition, the cruise industry and the



U.S. Public Health Service have agreed on regulations for food,
water and hygiene, aimed at proactively protecting the health of travelers and preventing illness transmission to U.S. ports.

Security and Safety

The IMO has adopted safety standards as part of the SOLAS convention,
which apply to all of our ships. SOLAS establishes requirements for vessel design, structural features, construction methods and
materials, refurbishment standards, life-saving equipment, fire protection and detection, safe management and operation and security
in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew. All of our crew undergo regular safety training exercises
that meet all international and national maritime regulations.

SOLAS requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety
procedures that comply with the requirements of the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution
Prevention (“ISM Code”). All of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ISM Code. Each such certificate is
granted for a five-year period and is subject to periodic verification.

The SOLAS requirements are amended and extended by the IMO from
time to time. For example, the International Port and Ship Facility Code (“ISPS Code”) was adopted by the IMO in December
2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments, port authorities and shipping
companies.

Amendments to SOLAS required that ships constructed in accordance
with pre-1974 SOLAS requirements install automatic sprinkler systems. IMO adopted an amendment to SOLAS which requires partial
bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of non-combustible construction. The SOLAS regulation implemented Long-Range Identification
and Tracking. All of our ships are in compliance with the requirements of SOLAS as amended and/or as applicable to the keel-laying
date.

In addition to the requirements of the ISPS Code, the U.S. Congress
enacted the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) which implements a number of security measures at
ports in the U.S. including measures that apply to ships registered outside the U.S. while docking at ports in the U.S. The U.S.
Coast Guard has published MTSA regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the U.S.,
provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification
of crew members on such ships. The Transportation Workers Identification Credential is a U.S. requirement for accessibility into
and onto U.S. ports and U.S.-flagged ships.

Maritime-Labor

In 2006, the International Labor Organization (“ILO”),
an agency of the United Nations that develops and oversees international labor standards, adopted a new Consolidated Maritime Labor
Convention (“MLC 2006”). MLC 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already
found in 68 maritime labor Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO since 1920. MLC 2006 includes a broad range of requirements,
such as a broader definition of a seafarer, minimum age of seafarers, medical certificates, recruitment practices, training, repatriation,
food, recreational facilities, health and welfare, hours of work and rest, accommodations, wages and entitlements. MLC 2006 added
requirements not previously in effect, in the areas of occupational safety and health. MLC 2006 became effective in certain countries
commencing August 2013. The Standard of Training Certification and Watch Keeping for Seafarers (“STCW”), as amended,
establishes minimum standards relating to training, certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers.

Financial Requirements

The Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”) requires evidence
of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of U.S. ports to indemnify passengers
in the event of non-performance of the transportation. Accordingly, each of our three brands are required to maintain a $30.0 million
third-party performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations to passengers.
The guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price index-based adjustments. Also, our brands have a legal requirement
to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the U.K. As of December 31, 2016, approximately British
Pound Sterling 10.5 million was in place as a security guarantee. We also are required to establish financial responsibility by
other jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of non-performance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions.

From time to time, various other regulatory and legislative changes
have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the U.S. and the cruise industry in general.

For information regarding risks associated with our compliance with
legal and regulatory requirements, see Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor
titled “We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, which could adversely
affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue.”



Taxation

U.S. Income Taxation

The following discussion is based upon current provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which
are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially
from the consequences described below.

Exemption of International Shipping Income under Section 883
of the Code

Under Section 883 of the Code (“Section 883”) and the
related regulations, a foreign corporation will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation on its U.S.-source income derived from
the international operation of ships (“shipping income”) if: (a) it is organized in a qualified foreign country, which
is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the U.S. in respect of each category
of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883; and (b) either: (1) more than 50% of the value of its
stock is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified shareholders, which includes individuals who are “residents”
of a qualified foreign country; (2) one or more classes of its stock representing, in the aggregate, more than 50% of the combined
voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities
markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the U.S. (the “publicly traded test”); or (3) it is a “controlled
foreign corporation” (a “CFC”) for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50% of its stock is owned
by qualified U.S. persons for more than half of the taxable year (the “CFC test”). In addition, U.S. Treasury Regulations
require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting
requirements.

NCLH is incorporated in Bermuda, a qualified foreign country which
grants an equivalent exemption, and NCLH meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares are primarily and regularly
traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, which is considered to be an established securities market in the U.S. Therefore, we
believe that NCLH qualifies for the benefits of Section 883.

We believe and have taken the position that substantially all of
NCLH’s income, including the income of its ship-owning subsidiaries, is properly categorized as shipping income, and that
we do not have a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that the IRS interpretation of shipping income
could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify (or will not qualify) as shipping income.
Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under Section 883.
There are factual circumstances beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH’s ordinary
shares, which could cause NCLH or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under Section 883. Further, any changes
in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income, and we can give no assurances on this
matter.

Under certain circumstances, changes in the identity, residence
or holdings of NCLH’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause NCLH’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded
on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under Section 883. Therefore, as a precautionary matter,
NCLH has provided protections in its bye-laws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly traded
test by prohibiting any person, other than the Sponsors, from owning, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 4.9% of
NCLH’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by NCLH’s Board of Directors (the “4.9% limit”).
Any outstanding shares held in excess of the 4.9% limit will be transferred to and held in a trust.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, Regent and its non-U.S. subsidiaries
are disregarded as entities separate from their immediate foreign parent (PCH) and Oceania Cruises is treated as a corporation.
For 2015 and 2016, both Regent and Oceania Cruises relied on NCLH’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify
for the benefits of Section 883 as discussed above. For 2014, both Regent and Oceania Cruises relied on PCH’s ability to
meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of Section 883. PCH is organized as a company in Panama, which grants
an equivalent tax exemption to U.S. corporations, and is thus classified as a qualified foreign country for purposes of Section
883. PCH was classified as a CFC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2014, and we believe PCH met the ownership and substantiation
requirements of the CFC test under the regulations for that year.

Taxation of International Shipping Income Where Section 883 of
the Code is Inapplicable

Unless exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, a foreign corporation
is subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the U.S.
If we fail to qualify for the exemption under Section 883 in respect of our U.S. sourced shipping income, or if the provision was
repealed, then we will be subject to taxation in the U.S. on such income.

Generally, “shipping income” is any income that is derived
from the use of vessels, from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time, voyage or Bareboat Charter basis or from the
performance of services directly related to those uses. For these purposes, shipping income attributable to transportation that
begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the U.S., which we refer to as “U.S.- source shipping income,”
will be considered to be 50% derived from sources within the U.S.

If we do not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if the
provision was repealed, then any U.S.-sourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected
income would be subject to federal corporate income taxation on a net basis (generally at a 35% rate) and state and local taxes,
and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30%, unless a lower
treaty rate applies (the “Net Tax Regime”). Our U.S. source shipping income is



considered effectively connected income if we have, or are considered
to have, a fixed place of business in the U.S. involved in the earning of U.S. source shipping income, and substantially all of
our U.S. source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows
a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the U.S.

If we do not have a fixed place of business in the U.S. or substantially
all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation, the income will generally not be considered to be effectively
connected income. In that case, we would be subject to a special 4% tax on our U.S. source shipping income (the “4% Tax Regime”).

Other United States Taxation

U.S. Treasury Regulations list several items of income which are
not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and, to the extent derived from U.S. sources, are subject
to U.S. federal income taxes under the Net Tax Regime discussed above. Income items considered non-incidental to the international
operation of ships include income from the sale of single-day cruises, shore excursions, air and other transportation, and pre-
and post-cruise land packages. We believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation
of ships is shipping income.

Income from U.S.-flagged Operation under the NCL America

Income derived from our U.S.-flagged operation generally will be
subject to U.S. corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels.  We expect that such income will not be subject
to U.S. branch profits tax nor a U.S. dividend withholding tax under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty.

U.K. Income Taxation

As a result of a restructuring, NCLH and NCLC became tax residents
of the U.K. and are subject to normal U.K. corporation tax.

U.S. Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels

Gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt from
tax under Section 883 provided NCLH qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 in respect of our shipping income. If, however,
our gain does not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if the provision was repealed, then such gain could be subject to
either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Tax Regime.

Certain State, Local and Non-U.S. Tax Matters

We may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income
taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file
tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal
income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property, or operations
involving foreign property may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.

Changes in Tax Laws

The various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result
in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. For example, legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from
U.S. federal income tax under Section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the U.S. Moreover,
we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or
future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty on income
derived in respect of our U.S.-flagged operation.

Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 3,000 full-time
employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 27,000 shipboard employees. Regent and Oceania Cruises’
ships also utilize a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant employees onboard. We refer you to “Risk Factors—Amendments
to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely
affect our financial results” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining
agreements that are currently in place.

Ports and Facilities

We own a private island in the Bahamas, Great Stirrup Cay, which
we utilize as a port-of-call on certain itineraries. We have also developed a cruise destination in Belize, Harvest Caye, which
we introduced in November 2016. In addition, we have entered into various agreements relating to port or berthing rights for our
ships, which include the following:

·

an agreement with the Government of Bermuda whereby we are permitted weekly calls in Bermuda through 2022 from Boston and New
York.



·

a contract with the New York City Economic Development Corporation pursuant to which we receive preferential berthing rights
at the Manhattan Cruise Terminal.

·

contracts with the Port of New Orleans, the Port of Miami, Port Canaveral and the Port of Tampa pursuant to which we receive
preferential Berths to the exclusion of other vessels for certain specified days of the week at the cities’ cruise ship terminals.

·

a concession permit with the U.S. National Park Service whereby our ships are permitted to call on Glacier Bay during each
summer cruise season through September 30, 2019.

·

an agreement with the British Virgin Islands Port Authority granting priority berthing rights for a 15-year term with two options
to extend the agreement for additional five year terms.

·

an agreement with the West Indian Company Limited granting priority berthing rights in St. Thomas for a 10-year term with an
option to extend the agreement for an additional five years.

·

a 15-year lease agreement with the Port of Seattle where we have committed to a capital investment to develop the port for
approximately $30 million and the port has committed to reimburse $15 million.

Segment Reporting

We have concluded that our business has a single reportable segment.
Each brand, Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available
and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment. Our operating
segments have similar economic and qualitative characteristics, including similar long-term margins and similar products and services;
therefore, we aggregate all of the operating segments into one reportable segment.

Although we sell cruises on an international basis, our passenger
ticket revenue is primarily attributed to U.S.-sourced guests who make reservations in the U.S. Revenue attributable to U.S.-sourced
guests was 81%, 75 % and 73% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No other individual country’s
revenues exceeded 10% in any of our last three years.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information contained in this annual
report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business. If any of the risks discussed
in this annual report actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In connection with the forward-looking statements
that appear in this annual report, you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “Cautionary
Statement Concerning Forward–Looking Statements.”

Risks Related to the Company

The adverse impact of general economic and related factors,
such as fluctuating or increasing levels of unemployment, underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices, declines in the securities
and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer
confidence. The demand for cruises is affected by international, national and local economic conditions.

The demand for cruises is affected by international, national and
local economic conditions. Adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in North America or globally, such as the
volatility of fuel prices, higher interest rates, stock and real estate market declines and/or volatility, more restrictive credit
markets, higher unemployment or underemployment rates, higher taxes and changes in governmental policies could reduce the level
of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests. Consequently, this may negatively
affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries, which are a discretionary purchase. Decreases in demand for cruise vacations
could result in price discounting, which, in turn, could reduce the profitability of our business. In addition, these conditions
could also impact our suppliers, which could result in disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us.

Terrorist acts, armed conflict and threats thereof, acts of
piracy, and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises.

The threat or possibility of future terrorist acts, an outbreak
of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility or fear of such events, political unrest and instability, the issuance
of travel advisories or elevated national threat warnings by national governments,



an increase in the activity of pirates, and other geo-political
uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises, and consequently,
the pricing for cruises. Decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely affect our
business by reducing our profitability.

Conducting business internationally may result in increased
costs and risks.

We operate our business internationally and plan to continue to
develop our international presence. Operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks, including political risks, risks
of increases in duties and taxes, risks relating to anti-bribery laws, as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising,
vacation or maritime businesses, or governing the operations of foreign-based companies may change. Additional risks include imposition
of trade barriers, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries
and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures, including value added taxes. If we are unable to address these risks
adequately, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Operating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes
conflicting legal and regulatory requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in
the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. We have implemented safeguards and policies
to prevent violations of various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments
and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards
and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct
prohibited by our policies, but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible. If our employees or agents violate our policies,
if we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we
fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil
sanctions and penalties.

We have operations in and source passengers from the United Kingdom
and other member countries of the European Union. On June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum
to withdraw from the European Union. The proposed withdrawal has resulted in increased volatility in the global financial markets
and caused severe volatility in global currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar
against foreign currencies, such as the euro, in which we do business. The proposed withdrawal could potentially adversely affect
tax, legal and regulatory regimes to which our business in the region is subject. The withdrawal could also, among other potential
outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Further, uncertainty
around these issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the United Kingdom and the other economies in which we operate
making it more difficult to source passengers from these regions. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Our expansion into and investments in new markets may not
be successful.

We believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our passenger
sourcing into major markets, such as Europe and Australia, as well as into emerging markets in the Asia Pacific region and to expand
our itineraries into new markets, such as Cuba, and we are in the process of such expansion efforts. Expansion into new markets
requires significant levels of investment and attention from management. There can be no assurance that these markets will develop
as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment spent
to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets, which could adversely impact our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information
technology and other networks could impair our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

The integrity and reliability of our information technology systems
and other networks are crucial to our business operations. Disruptions to these networks could impair our operations and have an
adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand. In addition, certain networks
are dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
Among other things, actual or threatened natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires, floods) or similar
events, information systems failures, computer viruses, denial of service attacks and other cyber-attacks may cause disruptions
to our information technology, telecommunications and other networks. While we have and continue to invest in business continuity,
disaster recovery, data restoration plans and data and information technology security, we cannot completely insulate ourselves
from disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results. We carry limited business interruption
insurance for certain shoreside operations, subject to limitations, exclusions and deductibles.

We have also made significant investments in our information technology
systems to optimize booking procedures, enhance the marketing power of our websites and control costs. Any unauthorized use of
our information systems to gain access to sensitive information, corrupt data or create general disturbances in our operations
systems could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation. If our security systems were breached, we could
be exposed to cyber-related risks and malware, and credit card and other sensitive data could be at risk. For example, in the processing
of our guest transactions and as part of our ordinary business operations, we and certain of our third-party service providers
collect, process, transmit and store a large volume of



personally identifiable information, including email addresses and
home addresses and financial data such as credit card information. The security of the systems and network where we and our service
providers store this data is a critical element of our business, and these systems and our network may be vulnerable to computer
viruses, hackers and other security issues. We cannot assure you that the precautions we have taken to avoid an unauthorized incursion
of our information systems are either adequate or implemented properly to prevent a data breach and its adverse financial and reputational
consequences to our business. We are also subject to laws relating to privacy of personal data. The compromise of our information
systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to the personally identifiable information of our guests,
prospective guests or employees could result in governmental investigation, civil liability or regulatory penalties under laws
protecting the privacy of personal information, any or all of which could disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect
our business. Additionally, any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry
security requirements or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit
cards as a form of payment.

In the event of a data security breach of our systems and/or third-party
systems, we may incur costs associated with the following: breach response, notification, forensics, regulatory investigations,
public relations, consultants, credit identity monitoring, credit freezes, fraud alert, credit identity restoration, credit card
cancellation, credit card reissuance or replacement, regulatory fines and penalties, vendor fines and penalties, legal fees and
damages. Denial of service attacks may result in costs associated with, among other things, the following: response, forensics,
public relations, consultants, data restoration, legal fees and settlement. In addition, data security breaches or denial of service
attacks may cause business interruption, information technology disruption, disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation,
digital asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data, damage to our reputation, damages to intangible property and other intangible
damages, such as loss of consumer confidence, all of which could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial
results.

Epidemics and viral outbreaks could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Public perception about the safety of travel and adverse publicity
related to passenger or crew illness, such as incidents of viral illnesses, stomach flu or other contagious diseases, may impact
demand for cruises and result in cruise cancellations and employee absenteeism. If any wide-ranging health scare should occur,
our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.

Adverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused
by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters, including, but not limited to, oil spills and other environmental mishaps,
fire, mechanical failure, collisions, human error, war, terrorism, piracy, political action, civil unrest and insurrection in various
countries and other circumstances or events. Any such event may result in loss of life or property, loss of revenue or increased
costs. The operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port, including missing guests,
inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes, which may bring into question passenger safety, may adversely affect
future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us. Although we place passenger safety as the highest priority in
the design and operation of our fleet, we have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships and there can
be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future. It is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or
a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased port-related and other costs resulting from such adverse events. Any
such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety
or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight. An adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing
claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us. Anything that damages our reputation (whether or not justified),
including adverse publicity about passenger safety, could have an adverse impact on demand, which could lead to price discounting
and a reduction in our sales and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If there is
a significant accident, mechanical failure or similar problem involving a ship, we may have to place a ship in an extended Dry-dock
period for repairs. This could result in material lost revenue and/or expenditures.

Changes in fuel prices and/or other cruise operating costs
would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations.

Fuel expense is a significant cost for our Company. Future increases
in the cost of fuel globally or regulatory requirements which require us to use more expensive types of fuel would increase the
cost of our cruise ship operations. In addition, we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces
and economic or political instability beyond our control. Despite any fuel hedges we are currently a party to, or may enter into
in the future, increases in fuel prices or other cruise operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations if we are unable to recover these increased costs through price increases charged to our guests.

An impairment of our tradenames or goodwill could adversely
affect our financial condition and operating results.

We evaluate tradenames and goodwill for impairment on an annual
basis, or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. Several
factors, including a challenging operating environment, impacts affecting consumer demand or spending, the deterioration of general
macroeconomic conditions, or other factors could result in a change to the future cash flows we expect to derive from our operations.
Reductions of the cash flows used in the impairment analyses



may result in the recording of an impairment charge to a reporting
unit’s tradename or goodwill, which could adversely impact our results of operations.

Our hedging strategies may not be cost-effective or adequately
protect us from increased costs related to changes in fuel prices.

In order to manage risks associated with the variable market prices
of fuel, we routinely hedge a portion of our future fuel requirements. However, our hedging program may not be successful in mitigating
higher fuel costs, and any price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions, including choice of hedging instruments,
breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties. To the extent
that we use hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly,
such hedge contracts may limit our ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future. There can be no assurance that
our hedging arrangements will be cost-effective, will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or
that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedging arrangements. Additionally, deterioration in our financial condition
could negatively affect our ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future.

Our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

There can be no assurance that all of our risks are fully insured
against or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance. Such losses, to the extent they are not adequately covered
by contractual remedies or insurance, could affect our financial results. In addition, we have been and continue to be subject
to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on our own claim records, but also the claim records of all other members of the
protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability. Our payment of these calls
and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us. If we were to sustain significant losses in the future, our
ability to obtain insurance coverage at all or at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected. Moreover,
irrespective of the occurrence of such events, there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance
coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all.

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability
to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent
us from making debt service payments.

Our level of indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our
operations and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, prospects and flexibility. Our substantial
indebtedness could:

·

limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, debt service requirements, strategic initiatives or other purposes;

·

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness;

·

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;

·

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;

·

make us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;

·

make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, the economy or the industry in which we operate;

·

restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities;

·

restrict us from taking certain actions by means of restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness;

·

make our credit card processors seek more restrictive terms in respect of our credit card arrangements; and

·

expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain borrowings are (and may be in the future) at a variable rate of interest.

We also may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness
at any time in the future. Although the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability
to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the
indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash
to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness,
including refinancing our indebtedness, that may not be successful. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates
and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.



The agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions
that limit our flexibility in operating our business.

The agreements governing our indebtedness contain, and any instruments
governing future indebtedness of ours may contain, covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us,
including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to, among other things:

·

incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preference shares;

·

pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital or make other restricted payments, including the ability of NCLH’s subsidiaries, including NCLC, to pay dividends or make distributions to NCLH;

·

repurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness;

·

make certain investments or acquisitions;

·

transfer or sell certain assets;

·

create liens on certain assets;

·

consolidate or merge with, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to, other companies;

·

enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;

·

pledge the capital stock of any guarantors of our indebtedness; and

·

designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.

As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in
which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or
capital needs.

We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral
under our existing debt agreements. If any of the holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness, there
can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness.

Under our existing debt agreements, we are required to satisfy and
maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and
there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios. A failure to comply with the covenants contained in our existing debt
agreements could result in an event of default under such agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of any default under our existing debt agreements,
the holders of our indebtedness thereunder:

·

will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us, if applicable;

·

could elect to declare all indebtedness outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, if applicable; and/or

·

could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay such indebtedness.

Such actions by the holders of our indebtedness could cause cross
defaults under our other indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the holders of our secured indebtedness could
proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.

If the indebtedness under our existing debt agreements were to be
accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.

The impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit
and financial markets may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks, including those
under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow additional
money on terms as favorable as our current debt, on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Economic downturns, including failures
of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis, can disrupt the capital and credit markets. Such disruptions could
cause counterparties under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress
payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them,
which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts
that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements. Also, we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts
due to our counterparties under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements. If we were
to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments, we would likely incur
significant costs to replace the counterparty. Any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in
additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument.



Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely
affect our financial results.

We earn revenues, pay expenses, purchase and own assets and incur
liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar; most significantly a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated
in foreign currencies, particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, euro and Australian dollar. Because our consolidated financial
statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S.
dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against
our other major currencies may adversely affect our U.S. dollar financial results and will reduce the U.S. dollar amount received
upon conversion of these currencies into U.S. dollars.

We have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction
contracts denominated in euros or other foreign currencies. While we have entered into foreign currency derivatives to manage a
portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts, we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions
of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged. Additionally, if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related
ship construction contract, any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated.

Overcapacity in key markets or globally could adversely affect
our operating results.

We continue to expand our fleet through our newbuild program and
may add up to ten additional ships to our fleet through 2027. Our competitors have also announced similar expansions to their fleets.
These increases in capacity in the cruise industry globally and potential overcapacity in certain key markets may cause us to lower
pricing, which would reduce profitability and adversely affect our results of operations.

Our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or
the loss of key personnel may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our success is dependent upon our personnel and our ability to recruit
and retain high quality employees. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees in order to
maintain our current business and support our projected growth.  We need to hire and train a considerable number of qualified
crew members to staff the ships that will be joining our fleet in the coming years. This may require significant efforts on the
part of our management team, and our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified crew members would adversely affect our
business.

Our executive officers and other members of senior management have
substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. The unexpected
loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us.

We rely on external distribution channels for passenger bookings,
and major changes in the availability of external distribution channels could undermine our customer base.

The majority of our guests book their cruises through independent
travel agents, wholesalers and tour operators. In the event that these distribution channels are adversely impacted by an economic
downturn, or by other factors, this could reduce the distribution channels available for us to market and sell our cruises and
we could be forced to increase the use of alternative distribution channels we are not accustomed to. If this were to occur, it
could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, independent travel agents, wholesalers and tour operators
generally sell and market our cruises on a non-exclusive basis. Although we offer commissions and other incentives to them for
booking our cruises, there can be no guarantee that our competitors will not offer higher commissions and incentives in the future.
Travel agents may face increasing pressure from our competitors, particularly in the North American market, to sell and market
our competitors’ cruises exclusively. If such exclusive arrangements were introduced, there can be no assurances that we
will be able to find alternative distribution channels to ensure that our customer base would not be affected.

We rely on third parties to provide hotel management services
for certain ships and certain other services, and we are exposed to risks facing such providers. In certain circumstances, we may
not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us.

We rely on external third parties to provide hotel management services
for certain ships and certain other services that are vital to our business. If these service providers suffer financial hardship
or are otherwise unable to continue providing such services, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such service providers
in a timely manner, which may cause an interruption in our operations. To the extent that we are able to replace such service providers,
we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services. Both the interruption of operations and the replacement of the
third-party service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Delays in our shipbuilding program and ship repairs, maintenance
and refurbishments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The new construction, refurbishment, repair and maintenance of our
cruise ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction,
refurbishment and repair projects. Our ships are subject to



the risk of mechanical failure or accident, which we have occasionally
experienced and have had to repair. If there is a mechanical failure or accident in the future, we may be unable to procure spare
parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense or suspension of service, especially if a problem affects
certain specialized maritime equipment, such as the radar, a pod propulsion unit, the electrical/power management system, the steering
gear or the gyro system.

In addition, availability, work stoppages, insolvency or financial
problems in the shipyards’ construction, refurbishment or repair of our ships, or other “force majeure” events
that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors, could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery,
refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships. Any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result
in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us, potential claims and impairment of losses. A significant
delay in the delivery of a new ship, or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have
an adverse effect on our business. The consolidation of the control of certain European cruise shipyards could result in higher
prices for refurbishment and repairs due to reduced competition. Also, the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result
in the inability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis. These potential events and the associated losses, to the extent
that they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance, could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

We rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger
and crew connections. Increases in the price of, or major changes or reduction in, commercial airline services could undermine
our customer base or disrupt our operations.

A number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial
airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises. Increases in the price of airfare due to increases
in fuel prices, fuel surcharges, changes in commercial airline services as a result of strikes, weather or other events, or the
lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could adversely affect our ability to deliver
guests and crew to or from our cruise ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which would, in turn, have an adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our revenue is seasonal, owing to variations in passenger
fare rates and occupancy levels at different times of the year. We may not be able to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover
our expenses during certain periods of the year.

The demand for our cruises is seasonal, with the greatest demand
for cruises generally occurring during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. This seasonality in demand has resulted in
fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out
of service for Dry-docks, which we typically schedule during off-peak demand periods for such ships. Accordingly, seasonality in
demand and Dry-dock periods could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover the expenses we incur during
certain periods of the year.

A failure to keep pace with developments in technology could
impair our operations or competitive position.

Our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems
and technology. These systems and technologies must be refined, updated and replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis
in order for us to meet our customers’ demands and expectations. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable
cost parameters, or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems, our business
could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology, such as fuel abatement
technologies, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results.

Amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew
members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results.

Currently, we are a party to eight collective bargaining agreements.
Three of these agreements are in effect through 2017 and four through 2018. The remaining one is set to expire in 2020. Any future
amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our
labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition. In addition, although our collective bargaining agreements have
a no-strike provision, they may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future. Any such disruptions in work could
have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

Unavailability of ports of call may materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason
why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation. The availability of ports, including the specific port
facility at which our guests will embark and disembark, is affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, existing
capacity constraints, security, safety and environmental concerns, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, financial
limitations on port development, political instability, exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors, local
governmental regulations and fees, local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities
from additional tourists and sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Treasury
Department or other regulatory bodies. Any limitations on the availability of ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions
and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Litigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could
adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation.

Our business is subject to various U.S. and international laws and
regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and
damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and/or lead to litigation or legal
proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. In certain circumstances, it
may not be economical to defend against such matters, and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter.
Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

As a result of any ship-related or other incidents, litigation claims,
enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations, including, but not limited to, those arising from personal injury,
loss of life, loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal
waters and the surrounding area, may be asserted or brought against various parties, including us and/or our cruise brands. The
time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims, actions and investigations. Subject to applicable
insurance coverage, we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims, actions and investigations and for any judgments,
fines, civil or criminal penalties if such claims, actions or investigations are adversely determined.

Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment in Which We Operate

Future changes in applicable tax laws, or our inability to
take advantage of favorable tax regimes, could increase the amount of taxes we must pay.

We believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered
to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income
(“shipping income”), is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes under Section 883, based upon certain assumptions as
to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “Item 1—Business—Taxation.” The provisions
of Section 883 are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.

We believe and have taken the position that substantially all of
our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have
a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify
(or will not qualify) as shipping income. Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which NCLH
will satisfy complex stock ownership tests or the publicly traded test under Section 883 as described in “Item 1—Business—
Taxation—Exemption of International Shipping Income under Section 883 of the Code.” There are factual circumstances
beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH’s ordinary shares, which could cause us or
our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption. Finally, any changes in our operations could significantly increase
our exposure to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Regime (each as defined in “Item 1—Business—Taxation”),
and we can give no assurances on this matter.

If we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption
under Section 883, our or such subsidiary’s U.S.-source income would be subject to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Regime
(each as defined in “Item 1— Business— Taxation). As of the date of this filing, we believe that NCLH and its
subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly traded test imposed under Section 883 and therefore believe that NCLH will qualify for the
exemption under Section 883. However, as discussed above, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause NCLH
to not meet the stock ownership or publicly traded tests. Therefore, we can give no assurances on this matter. We refer you to
“Item 1—Business—Taxation.”

We may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income
taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file
tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal
income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations
involving foreign property that may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.

The various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result
in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. For example, legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from
U.S. federal income tax under Section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the U.S. Moreover,
we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or
future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the U.S. – U.K. Income Tax Treaty on
income derived in respect of our U.S.–flagged operation.

We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including
environmental laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations
could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue

Some environmental groups have lobbied for more extensive oversight
of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact. Increasingly stringent
federal, state, local and international laws and regulations on environmental protection and health and safety of workers could
affect our operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the IMO (a United Nations agency with responsibility for the safety
and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships), the Council of the European Union and individual countries
and U.S. states are considering, as well as implementing, new laws



and rules to manage cruise ship operations and waste. In addition,
many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to governmental regulation by the U.S. Coast Guard as well as international treaties
such as SOLAS, an international safety regulation, MARPOL, an international environmental regulation, and STCW and its conventions
in ship manning.

The U.S. and various state and foreign government and regulatory
agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies, including those aimed at reducing the threat
of invasive species in ballast water, requiring the use of low-sulfur fuels, increasing fuel efficiency requirements and further
restricting emissions, including those of green-house gases, and improving sewage and greywater-handling capabilities. Compliance
with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures which
could adversely impact our operations as well as our competitors’ operations.

Among the laws impacting cruise ship operations are a 2006 ballot
measure approved by Alaskan voters requiring that cruise ships meet Alaska Water Quality Standards (“WQS”). The law
was relaxed in 2013, allowing ship operators to apply for mixing zones in discharge permits, an option that may ease compliance
with certain WQS, and reducing the need to remove ammonia, copper, zinc, and nickel from wastewater. The International Labor Organization’s
Maritime Labor Convention, 2006 went into force on August 20, 2013. The Convention regulates many aspects of maritime crew labor
and impacts the worldwide sourcing of new crew members. MARPOL regulations have established special ECAs with stringent limitations
on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions. Ships operating in designated ECAs (which include the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English
Channel, and many of the waters within 200 nautical miles of the U.S. and Canadian coasts including the Hawaiian Islands; waters
surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have been included as of January 2014) are generally expected to meet the new
sulfur oxide emissions limits through the use of low-sulfur fuels.

These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area
of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of
cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future. By virtue of our operations in the U.S., the
FMC requires us to maintain a third-party performance guarantee on our behalf in respect of liabilities for non-performance
of transportation and other obligations to guests. The FMC has proposed rules that would significantly increase the amount of
our required guarantees and accordingly our cost of compliance. There can be no assurance that such an increase in the amount
of our guarantees, if required, would be available to us. For additional discussion of the FMC’s proposed requirements,
we refer you to “Item 1—Business—Regulatory Issues.”

In 2007, the state of Alaska implemented taxes, some of which were
rolled back in 2010, which have impacted the cruise industry operating in Alaska. It is possible that other states, countries or
ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically
applicable to the cruise industry and its employees and/or guests, which could increase our operating costs and/or could decrease
the demand for cruises.

Risks Related to NCLH’s Ordinary Shares

Shareholders of NCLH may have greater difficulties in protecting
their interests than as shareholders of a U.S. corporation.

We are a Bermuda exempted company. The Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda
(the “Companies Act”), which applies to NCLH, differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations
and their shareholders. Taken together with the provisions of NCLH’s bye-laws, some of these differences may result in you
having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of NCLH than you would have as a shareholder of a U.S.
corporation. This affects, among other things, the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are
voidable, whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our Company, what
approvals are required for business combinations by our Company with a large shareholder or a wholly-owned subsidiary, what rights
you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the Companies Act or NCLH’s bye-laws, and the circumstances
under which we may indemnify our directors and officers.

NCLH does not have current plans to pay dividends on its ordinary
shares.

NCLH does not currently intend to pay dividends to its shareholders
and NCLH’s Board of Directors may never declare a dividend. Our existing debt agreements restrict, and any of our future
debt arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of NCLH’s subsidiaries, including NCLC, to pay distributions
to NCLH and NCLH’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. In addition, any determination to pay dividends in
the future will be entirely at the discretion of NCLH’s Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations,
cash requirements, financial condition, business opportunities, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law
and other factors that NCLH’s Board of Directors deems relevant. We are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends.
In addition, NCLH is a holding company and would depend upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to NCLH to
finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of NCLH. Investors seeking dividends should not purchase NCLH’s ordinary
shares.



Provisions in NCLH’s constitutional documents may prevent
or discourage takeovers and business combinations that NCLH’s shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.

NCLH’s bye-laws contain provisions that may delay, defer,
prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that its shareholders consider to be in their best interests. As a result,
these provisions may prevent NCLH’s shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of NCLH’s shares offered
by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect
the prevailing market price of NCLH’s shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. These provisions
include (subject to the shareholders’ agreement):

·

the ability of NCLH’s Board of Directors to designate one or more series of preference shares and issue preference shares without shareholder approval;

·

a classified board of directors;

·

the sole power of a majority of NCLH’s Board of Directors to fix the number of directors;

·

the power of NCLH’s Board of Directors to fill any vacancy on NCLH’s Board of Directors in most circumstances, including when such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise; and

·

advance notice requirements for nominating directors or introducing other business to be conducted at shareholder meetings.

Additionally, NCLH’s bye-laws contain provisions that prevent
third parties, other than the Apollo Holders, the TPG Viking Funds and Genting HK, from acquiring beneficial ownership of more
than 4.9% of its outstanding shares without the consent of NCLH’s Board of Directors and provide for the lapse of rights,
and sale, of any shares acquired in excess of that limit. The effect of these provisions as well as the significant ownership of
ordinary shares by our Sponsors may preclude third parties from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in NCLH in transactions
that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price
for their shares.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

Not applicable.

Item 2. Properties

Information about our cruise ships may be found under “Item
1. Business—Our Fleet” and “Item. 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

NCLH’s principal executive offices are located in Miami, Florida
where we lease approximately 313,600 square feet of facilities. We also have a lease of approximately 77,500 square feet for Prestige’s
former executive offices in Miami, Florida which we have subleased to a third party. We lease approximately (i) 24,300 square feet
of office space in Sunrise, Florida for sales; (ii) 25,600 square feet of office space in Honolulu, Hawaii for administrative purposes;
(iii) 10,300 square feet of office space in Southampton, England for sales and marketing in the U.K. and Ireland; (iv) 11,000 square
feet of office space in Wiesbaden, Germany for sales and marketing in Europe; (v) 31,000 square feet of office space in Phoenix,
Arizona for a call center; (vi) 17,600 square feet in Omaha, Nebraska for a call center; and (vii) 46,000 square feet of warehouse
space in Tampa, Florida for entertainment theatrical production.

Additionally, we lease a number of international offices throughout
Europe, Asia, South America and Australia to administer our brand operations globally. Norwegian owns a private island in the Bahamas,
Great Stirrup Cay, which we utilize as a port-of-call on some of our itineraries. We developed a cruise destination in Belize,
Harvest Caye, which was introduced in November 2016.

We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs,
and that we are capable of obtaining additional facilities as necessary.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of our business, various claims and lawsuits
have been filed or are pending against us. Most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and, accordingly, the maximum
amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount.

Nonetheless, the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits that
are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time. We have evaluated our overall exposure with respect to all of our
threatened and pending litigation and, to the extent required, we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable losses associated
with our deemed exposure. We are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses beyond those accrued, as discovery
is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery. However, based on our
current knowledge, we do not believe that the aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these matters
will be material to our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We intend to vigorously defend our
legal position on all claims and, to the extent necessary, seek recovery.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures

None.

Holders

As of February 17, 2017, there were 273 record holders of
NCLH’s ordinary shares. Since certain of NCLH’s ordinary shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf
of shareholders, the foregoing number is not representative of the number of beneficial owners.

Dividends

We intend to retain all currently available funds and as much as
necessary of future earnings in order to fund the continued development and growth of our business. Our debt agreements also impose
restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay distributions to NCLH and NCLH’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.
Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results
of operations, financial condition, restrictions imposed by applicable law and our financing agreements and other factors that
our Board of Directors deems relevant.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer

On April 29, 2014, NCLH’s Board of Directors authorized, and
NCLH announced, a three-year share repurchase program for up to $500.0 million. NCLH may make repurchases in the open market, in
privately negotiated transactions, in accelerated repurchase programs or in structured share repurchase programs, and any repurchases
may be made pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans. There was no share repurchase activity during the three months ended December 31, 2016,
and as of December 31, 2016, $263.5 million remained available for repurchases of our outstanding ordinary shares under the share
repurchase program.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data

The following selected financial data should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The statement of operations data and the balance sheet
data for the years ended, and as of, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 are derived from NCLH’s audited financial statements. Prior
to the year ended December 31, 2013, the financial statements are those of NCLC and they should be read in conjunction with
those audited financial statements and the related notes. We have retrospectively applied the exchange of ordinary shares due to
the Corporate Reorganization as the effect is substantially the same as a stock split. The Corporate Reorganization is reflected
in NCLH’s financial statements for the first time in the quarter ended March 31, 2013. In addition, the prior comparative
period will be the activity of NCLC during such period.

The financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2014 include the financial results of Prestige commencing on November 19, 2014, the date the Acquisition of Prestige was consummated
(we refer you to the Notes to The Consolidated Financial Statements Note—4 “The Acquisition of Prestige”).

Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Financial Presentation

Revenue from our cruise and cruise-related activities are categorized
by us as “passenger ticket revenue” and “onboard and other revenue.” Passenger ticket revenue and onboard
and other revenue vary according to product offering, the size of the ship in operation, the length of cruises operated and the
markets in which the ship operates. Our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises, which has historically been strongest
during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months.

Passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations,
meals in certain restaurants on the ship, certain onboard entertainment, and includes revenue for service charges and air and land
transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us. Onboard and other revenue primarily consists
of revenue from gaming, beverage sales, shore excursions, specialty dining, retail sales, spa services, photo services as well
as certain Bareboat Charter revenue. We record onboard revenue from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed
by independent concessionaires, from which we receive a share of their revenue.

Our cruise operating expense is classified as follows:

·

Commissions, transportation and other primarily consists of direct costs associated with passenger ticket revenue. These costs include travel agent commissions, air and land transportation expenses, related credit card fees, costs associated with service charges, certain port expenses and the costs associated with shore excursions and hotel accommodations included as part of the overall cruise purchase price.

·

Onboard and other primarily consists of direct costs that are incurred in connection with onboard and other revenue. These include costs incurred in connection with gaming, beverage sales and shore excursions.

·

Payroll and related consists of the cost of wages and benefits for shipboard employees and costs of certain inventory items, including food, for a third party that provides crew and other hotel services for certain ships.

·

Fuel includes fuel costs, the impact of certain fuel hedges and fuel delivery costs.

·

Food consists of food costs for passengers and crew on certain ships.

·

Other consists of repairs and maintenance (including Dry-dock costs), ship insurance and other ship expenses.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. We rely on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and
judgments. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies
reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These critical
accounting policies, which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements, relate to ship
accounting, asset impairment and contingencies.

Ship Accounting

Ships represent our most significant assets, and we record them
at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of ships is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives
of primarily 30 years after a 15% reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship. Improvement costs that we believe add
value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives. Repairs and
maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred. We account for Dry-dock costs under the direct expense method which
requires us to expense all Dry-dock costs as incurred.



We determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on our
estimates of the average useful life of the ships’ major component systems, such as cabins, main diesels, main electric,
superstructure and hull. In addition, we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions
and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. Given the large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates
related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently
uncertain. Should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual
values, depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher. If circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making
determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance
costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we reduced our estimated average 30-year ship
service life by one year, depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have increased by $11.2 million.
In addition, if our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for the same period would have increased
by $62.2 million. We believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied. We believe
that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit
from the ships’ usage.

Asset Impairment

We review our long-lived assets, principally ships, for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped
and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of
other groups of assets. We consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment
and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the
impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. We estimate fair value based on the best information
available making whatever estimates, judgments and projections considered necessary. The estimation of fair value is generally
measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the risk involved.

We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently
when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. For
our evaluation of goodwill and tradenames we use the Step 0 Test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
In order to make this evaluation, we consider the following circumstances:

·

General macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions; limitations on accessing capital; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; or other developments in equity and credit markets;

·

Industry and market conditions such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates; an increased competitive environment; a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (in both absolute terms and relative to peers); a change in the market for an entity’s products or services; or a regulatory or political development;

·

Changes in cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows;

·

Overall financial performance (for both actual and expected performance);

·

Entity and reporting unit specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; litigation; or a change in the composition or carrying amount of net assets; and

·

Share price (in both absolute terms and relative to peers).

We believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our long-lived
assets, principally ships, and goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable. Nonetheless, if there was
a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions
or circumstances that influence such assets, we could be required to record an impairment charge. If a material change occurred,
we may conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill.
This is called the Step I Test which consists of a combined approach using the expected future cash flows and market multiples
to determine the fair value of the reporting units.

In the third quarter of 2016, based on the performance of the Oceania
Cruises reporting unit, we performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation consisting of a Step I Test. Based on that evaluation,
we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill because its fair value exceeded its carrying value. For our annual impairment
evaluation, we performed a Step 0 Test for the Norwegian reporting unit and Step I Tests for the Regent Seven Seas and the Oceania
Cruises reporting units. Based on those evaluations, we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill because the fair value
of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. However, if the fair value of any reporting unit declines in future periods,
its goodwill may become impaired at that time. As of December 31, 2016, there was $523.0 million, $462.1 million and $403.8 million
of goodwill for the Oceania Cruises, Regent Seven Seas and Norwegian reporting units, respectively. As of December 31, 2016,
our annual review consisting of the Step 0 and Step I Tests supports the carrying value of these assets.



Contingencies

Periodically, we assess potential liabilities related to any lawsuits
or claims brought against us or any asserted claims, including tax, legal and/or environmental matters. Although it is typically
very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable
that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation
of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the amount of
insurance recoveries, if any. In accordance with the guidance on accounting for contingencies, we accrue a liability when we believe
a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual
outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries, although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable,
it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimated provisions or previous
disclosures.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Net Revenue,
Adjusted Net Revenue, Net Yield, Adjusted Net Yield, Net Cruise Cost, Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel, Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS, to enable us to analyze our performance. See “Terms Used in this Annual Report”
for the definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Net Revenue and Net Yield to manage our business on a day-to-day
basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by
us net of significant variable costs. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income,
we believe changes in Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.

As our business includes the sourcing of passengers and
deployment of vessels outside of the U.S., a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies,
particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, euro and Australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency
exchange rates versus our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. In order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations, we
calculate certain non-GAAP measures on a Constant Currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in
foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period. We believe that
presenting these non-GAAP measures on both a reported and Constant Currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive
view of trends in our business. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is
used by management to assess operating performance.

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure in determining
our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general
and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA
is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not
take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and
tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.

In addition, Adjusted Net Revenue and Adjusted Net Yield, which
exclude certain business combination accounting entries, are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful as supplemental
measures in evaluating the performance of our operating business and provide greater transparency into our results of operations.
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP
net income and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe
that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and
when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal
comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive
compensation. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly,
our presentation of Adjusted Net Revenue, Adjusted Net Yield, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS may not be indicative of future
adjustments or results. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $28.0 million of amounts related to the
extinguishment of debt and $11.2 million of deferred financing fees due to the refinancing of certain credit facilities. We included
these as adjustments in the reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income since these amounts are not representative of our day-to-day
operations and we have included similar adjustments in prior periods.

You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating
our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis.
In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments
in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures
in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial
measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures
to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “Results of Operations”
section.



Summary of Significant 2016 Events

Sirena, previously under a Bareboat Charter, joined our Oceania
Cruises fleet in April 2016. This ship is approximately 30,000 Gross Tons with approximately 684 Berths.

Seven Seas Explorer was delivered in June 2016 to our Regent
fleet. This ship is approximately 55,000 Gross Tons with 750 Berths. We placed an order to build a second Explorer Class Ship
for delivery in the winter of 2020.

We introduced a new destination, Harvest Caye, in November 2016.
This destination in Southern Belize features Belize’s only cruise ship pier, expansive seven acre white sand beach, 15,000
sq. ft. pool with swim up bar, multiple dining options and a nature center with wildlife experiences plus adventure tours.

We repurchased approximately $50 million of NCLH’s outstanding
ordinary shares under our previously authorized three-year, $500 million share repurchase program.

In February 2017, we announced that we plan to introduce an additional
four ships with expected delivery dates through 2025 and we have an option to introduce two additional ships for delivery
in 2026 and 2027, subject to certain conditions. These four ships are each 140,000 gross tons with approximately 3,300 Berths.
The contract price for each of the four ships is approximately €800.0 million, subject to certain conditions, or $841.4 million
based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2016. We have obtained export credit financing for the four ships to fund approximately
80% of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2025, subject to certain conditions.

Executive Overview

Total revenue increased 12.2% to $4.9 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared to $4.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net Revenue for the year ended December 31,
2016 increased 13.8% to $3.8 billion from $3.3 billion in the same period in 2015 with an improvement in Net Yield of 2.1% and
an increase in Capacity Days of 11.4%.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had net income and diluted
EPS of $633.1 million and $2.78, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net income and diluted EPS of $427.1
million and $1.86, respectively. Operating income increased 31.7% to $925.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from
$702.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

We had Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS of $776.3 million and
$3.41, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, which includes $143.2 million of adjustments primarily consisting of
expenses related to non-cash compensation, write-offs of fees related to extinguishment of debt and refinancing of certain credit
facilities and certain other adjustments. A 17.7% improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was achieved for the same period primarily due
to the increase in net income and EBITDA. We refer you to our “Results of Operations” below for a calculation of Net
Revenue, Net Yield, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 (“2016”) Compared
to Year Ended December 31, 2015 (“2015”)

Revenue

Total revenue increased 12.2% to $4.9 billion in 2016 compared to
$4.3 billion in 2015 primarily due to an increase in Capacity Days and improved pricing. Gross Yield increased 0.7%. Net Revenue
in 2016 increased 13.8% to $3.8 billion from $3.3 billion in 2015 due to an increase in Capacity Days of 11.4% and an increase
in Net Yield of 2.1%. The increase in Capacity Days was primarily due to the delivery of Norwegian Escape in October 2015, Sirena
joining our fleet in April 2016 and the delivery of Seven Seas Explorer in June 2016. The increase in Net Yield was primarily due
to improved pricing. Adjusted Net Revenue includes a deferred revenue fair value adjustment of $32.4 million in 2015 related to
the Acquisition of Prestige. On a Constant Currency basis, Net Yield and Adjusted Net Yield increased 2.8% and 1.8%, respectively,
in 2016 compared to 2015.



Expense

Gross Cruise Cost increased 9.5% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to
an increase in total cruise operating expense and marketing, general and administrative expenses. Total cruise operating expense
increased 7.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the increase in Capacity Days as discussed above and an increase in marketing,
general and administrative expenses. Total other operating expense increased 11.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an
increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses which included an increase in marketing expenses of $38.3 million and
share-based compensation of $16.4 million. The increase was also due to income of $43.4 million related to a contingent
consideration adjustment on the Acquisition of Prestige in 2015 which did not occur in 2016. Depreciation and amortization expense
was relatively unchanged as the increase due to the addition of Norwegian Escape and ship improvement projects in 2016 was offset
by the recognition in 2015 of an incremental $51.6 million of amortization of intangible assets due to the Acquisition of Prestige.
On a Capacity Day basis, Net Cruise Cost decreased slightly on an actual and a Constant Currency basis, due to a decrease in fuel
expense partially offset by the increases in expenses discussed above. The average fuel price decreased 13.5% to $466 per metric
ton in 2016 from $539 per metric ton in 2015. Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day increased 1.5% primarily
due to the expenses discussed above (1.7% on a Constant Currency basis). We refer you to the “Results of Operations”
above for a reconciliation of Gross Cruise Cost to Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel.

Interest expense, net increased to $276.9 million in 2016 from $221.9
million in 2015 primarily due to an increase in average debt balances outstanding primarily associated with the delivery of new
ships and newbuild installments as well as from higher interest rates due to an increase in LIBOR. Additionally, in connection
with refinancings of our senior notes and certain of our credit facilities, interest expense, net included losses on extinguishment
of debt and debt modification costs of $39.2 million in 2016 and losses on extinguishment of debt of $12.6 million in 2015.

Other income (expense), net was an expense of $8.3 million
in 2016 compared to an expense of $46.7 million in 2015. In 2016, the expense was primarily related to $16.1 million of
unrealized and realized losses on fuel swap derivative hedge contracts partially offset by $4.5 million of gains on foreign currency
exchange and $3.9 million of gains on foreign currency exchange derivative hedge contracts. In 2015, the expense was primarily
related to $30.7 million of losses from the dedesignation of certain fuel swap derivative hedge contracts and the ineffectiveness
of settled fuel swaps in 2015. Also included in 2015 was an expense of $26.2 million related to the fair value adjustment of a
foreign exchange collar which does not receive hedge accounting treatment partially offset by $11.0 million of foreign currency
transaction gains.

In 2016, we had an income tax expense of $7.2 million compared to
$6.8 million in 2015.

Year Ended December 31, 2015 (“2015”) Compared
to Year Ended December 31, 2014 (“2014”)

Revenue

Total revenue increased 39.0% to $4.3 billion in 2015 compared to
$3.1 billion in 2014. Gross Yield increased 18.3%. Net Revenue increased 37.9% in 2015, primarily due to an increase in Capacity
Days of 17.5% and Net Yield of 17.4%. The increase in Capacity Days was primarily due to the Acquisition of Prestige, the delivery
of Norwegian Escape and the operation of Norwegian Getaway for the full year of 2015. The increase in Net Yield was primarily due
to an increase in passenger ticket pricing and higher onboard and other revenue. Adjusted Net Revenue for 2015 includes a deferred
revenue fair value adjustment of $32.4 million related to the Acquisition of Prestige. On a Constant Currency basis, Net Yield
and Adjusted Net Yield increased 19.4% and 20.0%, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014.

Expense

Gross Cruise Cost increased 36.6% in 2015 compared to 2014
due to an increase in total cruise operating expense and marketing, general and administrative expenses. Total cruise
operating expense increased 36.4% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in Capacity Days as discussed above.
Total other operating expense increased 46.0% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in marketing, general and
administrative expenses primarily related to the Acquisition of Prestige including certain restructuring and severance costs,
as well as amortization expense related to the Prestige intangible assets and depreciation expense related to the Prestige
ships. These increases were partially offset by the $43.4 million fair value adjustment for the contingent consideration
related to the Acquisition of Prestige. On a Capacity Day basis, Net Cruise Cost increased 14.0% (14.8% on a Constant
Currency basis) due to an increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses as discussed above and certain crew
related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in fuel expense which was primarily the result of a 13.8% decrease in the
average fuel price to $539 per metric ton in 2015 from $625 per metric ton in 2014. Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel
per Capacity Day increased 24.0% (25.0% on a Constant Currency basis) primarily due to the increase in expenses discussed
above.

Interest expense, net increased to $221.9 million in 2015 from $151.8
million in 2014 primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding in connection with the Acquisition of Prestige.



Other income (expense), net was an expense of $46.7 million in 2015
compared to an expense of $10.9 million in 2014. This increase was primarily related to an expense of $30.7 million from the dedesignation
of certain fuel swap derivative hedge contracts and the ineffectiveness of settled fuel swaps in 2015. Also included in 2015 was
an expense of $26.2 million related to the fair value adjustment of a foreign exchange collar which does not receive hedge accounting
treatment partially offset by $11.0 million of foreign currency transaction gains.

We had an income tax expense of $6.8 million in 2015 compared to
an income tax benefit of $2.3 million in 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed the implementation of a tax restructuring
which had a favorable impact on the amount of income subject to U.S. corporate tax which continued through calendar year 2014 and
2015. In addition, during the first quarter of 2014, we received information which allowed us to elect a tax method to calculate
deductible interest expense resulting in a tax benefit of $11.1 million including a $5.3 million non-recurring benefit that has
been excluded from Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

As of December 31, 2016, our liquidity was $749.3 million consisting
of $128.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $621.0 million available under our New Revolving Loan Facility. Our primary
ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital, capital expenditures and debt service.

As of December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of
$1.9 billion. This deficit included $1.2 billion of advance ticket sales, which represents the total revenue we collect in advance
of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities.
Our business model, along with our New Revolving Loan Facility, allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet
our operating, investing and financing needs.

Our existing debt agreements restrict, and any of our future debt
arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of our subsidiaries, including NCLC, to make distributions and/or to
pay dividends to NCLH and our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders. We are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries
for their ability to pay distributions to us to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of NCLH. However, we do not believe
that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations.

Sources and Uses of Cash

In this section, references to 2016 refer to the year ended
December 31, 2016, references to 2015 refer to the year ended December 31, 2015 and references to 2014 refer to the year
ended December 31, 2014.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in 2016
compared to $1.0 billion in 2015 and $635.6 million in 2014. The change in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 reflects
net income of $633.1 million, as well as timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to operating assets and liabilities
and advance ticket sales of $135.0 million. The change in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 reflects net income
of $427.1 million compared to net income of $342.6 million in 2014, as well as timing differences in cash receipts and payments
relating to operating assets and liabilities and advance ticket sales of $218.3 million in 2015 compared to $(23.9) million in
2014.

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion in 2016,
primarily related to payments for the delivery of Seven Seas Explorer, ship improvements, ships under construction and shoreside
projects. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion in 2015, primarily related to payments for our newbuild ships,
the delivery of Norwegian Escape, ship improvements and shoreside projects. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion
in 2014, primarily due to payments related to the Acquisition of Prestige, the delivery of Norwegian Getaway, and
 our Breakaway Plus Class Ships and other ship improvements and shoreside projects.

Net cash used in financing activities was $98.3 million in 2016,
primarily from the repayments of our 5.25% senior unsecured notes, net repayments of our New Revolving Loan Facility and other
loan facilities, the repurchase of our ordinary shares and deferred financing fees and other, partially offset by issuance of our
$700.0 million 4.750% senior unsecured notes. Net cash provided by financing activities was $195.2 million in 2015, primarily from
the issuance of our $600.0 million 4.625% senior unsecured notes, borrowings related to our Revolving Loan Facility and our Breakaway
three loan facility for the delivery of Norwegian Escape, partially offset by redemption of our $300.0 million 5.00% senior unsecured
notes due 2018 and repayments on our Revolving Loan Facility and other loan facilities. Net cash provided by financing activities
was $1.2 billion in 2014, primarily due to borrowings of an incremental $700.0 million under our $1.4 billion term loan facility,
our $350.0 million senior secured term loan facility and borrowings under the Breakaway two loan and credit facilities related
to our Breakaway Plus Class Ships partially offset by repayments of our Revolving Loan Facility and other borrowings. In November
2014, we also issued the $680.0 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes which have been redeemed.

Future Capital Commitments

Future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments, including
ship construction contracts, and future expected capital expenditures necessary for operations as well as our ship refurbishment
projects. As of December 31, 2016, anticipated capital



expenditures were $1.3 billion for each of the years ending December
31, 2017 and 2018 and $1.2 billion for 2019. We have export credit financing in place for the expenditures related to ship construction
contracts of $0.8 billion for 2017, $0.7 billion for 2018 and $0.6 billion for 2019. These future expected capital expenditures
will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense.

We have Norwegian Joy, Norwegian Bliss and one additional Breakaway
Plus Class Ship on order for delivery in the spring of 2017, spring of 2018 and the fall of 2019, respectively. These ships will
be amongst the largest in our fleet, each reaching approximately 164,600 Gross Tons. The combined contract price of these three
ships is approximately €2.6 billion, or $2.7 billion based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2016.
We have export credit financing in place that provides financing for 80% of their contract prices. We have an Explorer Class Ship
on order with an original contract price of approximately €422.0 million, or approximately $443.8 million based on the euro/U.S.
dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2016. We have export credit financing in place that provides financing for 80% of the contract
price. The Explorer Class Ship is expected to be delivered in the winter of 2020.

In February 2017, we announced that we plan to introduce an additional
four ships with expected delivery dates through 2025 and we have an option to introduce two additional ships for delivery
in 2026 and 2027, subject to certain conditions. These four ships are each 140,000 gross tons with approximately 3,300 Berths.
The contract price for each of the four ships is approximately €800.0 million, subject to certain conditions, or $841.4 million
based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2016. We have obtained export credit financing for the four ships to fund approximately
80% of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2025, subject to certain conditions.

In connection with the contracts to build these ships, we do not
anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellation to occur. However, if any would occur, it could result in, among other things,
the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us, subject to certain refund guarantees, and potential claims and impairment
losses which may materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014 was $33.7 million, $31.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively, primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild
ships.

Other

Certain service providers may require collateral in the normal course
of our business. The amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions.

As a routine part of our business, depending on market conditions,
exchange rates, pricing and our strategy for growth, we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building
of additional ships. We may also consider the sale of ships, potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these were
to occur, they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness, through cash flows from operations,
or through the issuance of debt, equity or equity-related securities.

Funding Sources

Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that, among other
things, require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity, as well as limit our net funded debt-to-capital ratio, maintain certain
other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends. Substantially all of our ships and other property and equipment are pledged
as collateral for certain of our debt. We believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2016.

The impact of changes in world economies and especially the global
credit markets can create a challenging environment and may reduce future consumer demand for cruises and adversely affect our
counterparty credit risks. In the event this environment deteriorates, our business, financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely impacted.

We believe our cash on hand, expected future operating cash inflows,
additional available borrowings under our existing credit facility and our ability to issue debt securities or raise additional
equity, will be sufficient to fund operations, debt payment requirements, capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants
under our debt agreements over the next twelve-month period. There is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional
financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations.

Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about
Market Risk

General

We are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal
operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives. The financial impacts of these derivative instruments are
primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching the notional,
term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or
other speculative purposes. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses.

Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2016, we had interest rate swap agreements
to hedge our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense. As of December 31, 2016, 55.0% of our
debt was fixed and 45.0% was variable, which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps. The notional amount of outstanding
debt associated with the interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2016 was $308.5 million. Based on our December 31,
2016 outstanding variable rate debt balance, a one percentage point increase in annual LIBOR would increase our annual interest
expense by approximately $29.1 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2016, we had foreign currency
derivatives to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts
denominated in euros. These derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the payments on our
ship construction contracts. The payments not hedged aggregate €146.9 million, or $154.5 million based on the
euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2016. We estimate that a 10% change in the euro as of
December 31, 2016 would result in a $15.5 million change in the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency
denominated remaining payments.

Fuel Price Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to
the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships. Fuel expense, as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense, was 11.8%,
13.5% and 16.8% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We use fuel derivative agreements to mitigate
the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of December 31, 2016, we had hedged approximately 78%, 66%, 48%
and 18% of our 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 projected metric tons of fuel purchases, respectively. We estimate that a 10% increase
in our weighted-average fuel price would increase our anticipated 2017 fuel expense by $28.5 million. This increase would be partially
offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of $17.8 million. Fair value of our derivative contracts is
derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach. These valuation models take into account the contract
terms such as maturity, as well as other inputs such as fuel types, fuel curves, creditworthiness of the counterparty and the Company,
as well as other data points.



Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on
Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of December 31, 2016. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system
of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls
and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving
their control objectives. Based upon management’s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance that the
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the

Treadway Commission (“COSO Framework”). Based on this
evaluation under the COSO Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2016.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered certified public accounting
firm, as stated in their report, which is included on page F-1.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition,
the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these
and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only the reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving
their goals under all potential future conditions.

Report of Independent Registered Certified
Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Norwegian Cruise Line
Holdings Ltd.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15 (2) presents fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial
statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits
of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1.

Description of Business and Organization

NCLH is a leading global cruise company which operates
the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. We have 24 ships with approximately 46,500 Berths
and plan to introduce eight additional ships through 2025 (we refer you to Note 16— “Subsequent Events”).

Norwegian commenced operations from Miami in 1966. In
February 2000, Genting HK acquired control of and subsequently became the sole owner of the Norwegian operations.

In January 2008, the Apollo Holders acquired 50% of
the outstanding ordinary share capital of NCLC. As part of this investment, the Apollo Holders assumed control of NCLC’s
Board of Directors. Also, in January 2008, the TPG Viking Funds acquired, in the aggregate, 12.5% of NCLC’s outstanding share
capital from the Apollo Holders.

In February 2011, NCLH, a Bermuda limited company, was
formed with the issuance to the Sponsors of, in aggregate, 10,000 ordinary shares, with a par value of $.001 per share. On January
24, 2013, NCLH consummated the IPO. In connection with the consummation of the IPO, the Sponsors’ ordinary shares in NCLC
were exchanged for the ordinary shares of NCLH at a share exchange ratio of 1.0 to 8.42565 and NCLH became the owner of 100% of
the ordinary shares and parent company of NCLC (the “Corporate Reorganization”). Accordingly, NCLH contributed $460.0
million to NCLC and the historical financial statements of NCLC became those of NCLH. The Corporate Reorganization was effected
solely for the purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure. NCLH had not prior to the completion of the Corporate Reorganization
conducted any activities other than those incidental to its formation and to preparations for the Corporate Reorganization and
IPO. The Corporate Reorganization resulted in all parties being in the same economic position as they were immediately prior to
the IPO. As the economic position of the investors did not change as part of the Corporate Reorganization it is considered a nonsubstantive
merger from an accounting perspective.

As a result of the Corporate Reorganization, NCLC was
treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the terms of the partnership (including the economic rights
with respect thereto) were set forth in an amended and restated tax agreement for NCLC. Economic interests in NCLC were represented
by the partnership interests established under the tax agreement, which we refer to as “NCL Corporation Units.” The
NCL Corporation Units held by NCLH (as a result of its ownership of 100% of the ordinary shares of NCLC) represented a 97.3% economic
interest in NCLC as of the consummation of the IPO. The remaining 2.7% economic interest in NCLC as of the consummation of the
IPO was in the form of Management NCL Corporation Units held by management (or former management).

In November 2014, we completed the Acquisition of Prestige.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, all Management NCL Corporation
Units were exchanged for NCLH ordinary shares and restricted shares. NCLH became the sole member and 100% owner of the economic
interests in NCLC and the non-controlling interest no longer exists. Accordingly, NCLC is now treated as a disregarded entity for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. No new NCLC profits interests or Management NCL Corporation Units will be issued; however, NCLH
has granted, and expects to continue to grant, equity to its employees and members of its Board of Directors under its long-term
incentive plan.

The Sponsors have completed numerous Secondary Equity
Offerings and as of December 31, 2016 have reduced their ownership to 29.4% of NCLH’s ordinary shares (we refer you to Note
8— “Related Party Disclosures”).

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and contain all normal recurring adjustments
necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. Estimates are required for the preparation of consolidated
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and actual results could differ from these estimates.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassification

Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified
to conform to the current period presentation. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we combined liabilities that were previously
reflected in accounts payable with accrued liabilities in our consolidated

F-



balance sheets to better reflect
all accruals in one caption. This change was applied retrospectively.  As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued
liabilities increased and accounts payable decreased by $7.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively. This change does not impact
net working capital movements, operating cash flows or total current liabilities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, and
include cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less at acquisition and also include amounts due from
credit card processors.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of cash collateral in respect
of certain agreements and is included in prepaid expenses and other assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance
sheets.

Accounts Receivable, Net

Accounts receivable are shown net of an allowance
for doubtful accounts of $4.7 million and $3.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories mainly consist of provisions, supplies
and fuel and are carried at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method of accounting.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred except
for those that result in tangible assets, including brochures, which are treated as prepaid expenses and charged to expense as
consumed. Advertising costs of $1.3 million and $3.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
are included in prepaid expenses and other assets. Expenses related to advertising costs totaled $270.5 million, $232.2 million
and $122.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Earnings Per Share

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable
to Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. by the basic weighted-average number of shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS
is computed by dividing net income by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. A reconciliation between basic and diluted EPS
was as follows (in thousands, except share and per share data):

shares outstanding because the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive.

Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Major
renewals and improvements that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as a cost of the ship while costs of repairs and
maintenance, including Dry-dock costs, are charged to expense as incurred. During ship construction, certain interest is capitalized
as a cost of the ship. Gains or losses on the sale of property and equipment are recorded as a component of operating income (expense)
in our consolidated statements of operations.

Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets and after a 15% reduction for the estimated residual values of ships as follows:

F-



Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the lease term or related asset life.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment, based
on estimated future cash flows, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely
independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. We consider historical performance and future estimated results in our
evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected
to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows,
we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. We estimate fair value
based on the best information available making whatever estimates, judgments and projections are considered necessary. The estimation
of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the risk involved.

Goodwill and Tradenames

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the
fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets, principally tradenames, are reviewed for impairment
on an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of these
assets could not be fully recovered. We use the Step 0 Test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether
it is more likely than not (i.e., more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In order
to make this evaluation, we consider the following circumstances as well as others:

·

General macroeconomic
conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions; limitations on accessing capital; fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates; or other developments in equity and credit markets;

·

Industry and market conditions
such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates; an increased competitive environment; a decline in market-dependent
multiples or metrics (in both absolute terms and relative to peers); a change in the market for an entity’s products or
services; or a regulatory or political development;

·

Changes in cost factors
that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows;

·

Overall financial performance
(for both actual and expected performance);

·

Entity and reporting
unit specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; litigation; or a change in the composition
or carrying amount of net assets; and

·

Share price (in both
absolute terms and relative to peers).

We also may conduct a quantitative assessment comparing
the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. This is called the Step I Test which consists
of a combined approach using the expected future cash flows and market multiples to determine the fair value of the reporting units.
Our discounted cash flow valuation reflects our projection for growth and profitability, taking into account our assessment of
future market conditions and demand, as well as a determination of a cost of capital that incorporates both business and financial
risks. We believe that the combined approach is the most representative method to assess fair value as it utilizes expectations
of long-term growth as well as current market conditions.

In the third quarter of 2016, based on the performance
of the Oceania Cruises reporting unit, we performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation consisting of a Step I Test. Based
on that evaluation, we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill because its fair value exceeded its carrying value.
For our annual impairment evaluation, we performed a Step 0 Test for the Norwegian reporting unit and Step I Tests for the Regent
Seven Seas and the Oceania Cruises reporting units. Based on those evaluations, we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill
because the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. However, if the fair value of any reporting unit declines
in future periods, its goodwill may become impaired at that time. As of December 31, 2016, there was $523.0 million, $462.1 million
and $403.8 million of goodwill for the Oceania Cruises, Regent Seven Seas and Norwegian reporting units, respectively. As of December 31,
2016, our annual review consisting of the Step 0 and Step I Tests supports the carrying value of these assets.

F-



We have concluded that our business has three reporting
units. Each brand, Oceania Cruises, Regent and Norwegian, constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available
and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment.

Revenue and Expense Recognition

Deposits received from guests for future voyages
are recorded as advance ticket sales and are subsequently recognized as passenger ticket revenue along with onboard and other
revenue, and all associated direct costs of a voyage are recognized as cruise operating expenses on a pro-rata basis over the
period of the voyage. Guest cancellation fees are recognized in passenger ticket revenue in the month of the cancellation.
Certain of our product offerings are accounted for under the guidance included within multi-element arrangements and result in
an allocation of the fair value between passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue.

Revenue and expenses include port fees and taxes.
The amounts included on a gross basis are $286.6 million, $243.8 million and $240.7 million for the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs related to a recognized
debt liability are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount
of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. For line of credit arrangements and for those debt facilities not fully
drawn we defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset. These deferred issuance costs are amortized over the life
of the loan agreement. The amortization of deferred financing fees is included in depreciation and amortization expense in
the consolidated statements of cash flows; however, for purposes of the consolidated statements of operations it is included in
interest expense, net.

Foreign Currency

The majority of our transactions are settled in
U.S. dollars. We translate assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet
date. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in other currencies are recognized in our consolidated statements
of operations within other income (expense), net and such gains were approximately $4.5 million, $11.0 million and $6.0 million
for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity

We enter into derivative contracts to reduce our
exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices. The criteria used to determine whether
a transaction qualifies for hedge accounting treatment includes the correlation between fluctuations in the fair value of the hedged
item and the fair value of the related derivative instrument and its effectiveness as a hedge. As the derivative is marked to fair
value, we elected an accounting policy to net the fair value of our derivatives when a master netting arrangement exists with our
counterparties.

A derivative instrument that hedges a forecasted
transaction or the variability of cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability may be designated as a cash flow hedge.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings. To the extent that an instrument
is not effective as a hedge, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.
Realized gains and losses related to our effective fuel hedges are recognized in fuel expense. For presentation in our consolidated
statements of cash flows, we have elected to classify the cash flows from our cash flow hedges in the same category as the cash
flows from the items being hedged.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

We monitor concentrations of credit risk associated
with financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business. Credit risk, including but not limited to counterparty
non-performance under derivative instruments, our New Revolving Loan Facility and new ship progress payment guarantees, is not
considered significant, as we primarily conduct business with large, well-established financial institutions and insurance companies
that we have well-established relationships with and that have credit risks acceptable to us or the credit risk is spread out among
a large number of creditors. We do not anticipate non-performance by any of our significant counterparties.

Insurance

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance
for a number of risks including claims related to crew and guests, hull and machinery, war risk, workers’ compensation, property
damage, employee healthcare and general liability. Liabilities associated with certain of these risks, including crew and passenger
claims, are estimated actuarially based upon known facts, historical trends and a reasonable estimate of future expenses. While
we believe these accruals are adequate, the ultimate losses incurred may differ from those recorded.

F-



Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated
in accordance with the liability method. Deferred taxes are recorded using the currently enacted tax rates that apply in the periods
that the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred taxes are not discounted.

We provide a valuation allowance on deferred tax
assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. With respect to acquired deferred tax assets, future
reversals of the valuation allowance will first be applied against goodwill and other intangible assets before recognition of a
benefit in our consolidated statements of operations.

Share-Based Compensation

We recognize expense for our share-based compensation
awards using a fair-value-based method. Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards
that are based on a service period and not contingent upon any future performance. We refer you to Note 10—“Employee
Benefits and Share-Based Compensation.”

Segment Reporting

We have concluded that our business has a single
reportable segment. Each brand, Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent constitutes a business for which discrete financial information
is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment.
Our operating segments have similar economic and qualitative characteristics, including similar long-term margins and similar products
and services; therefore, we aggregate all of the operating segments into one reportable segment.

Although we sell cruises on an international basis,
our passenger ticket revenue is primarily attributed to U.S.-sourced guests who make reservations in the U.S. Revenue attributable
to U.S.-sourced guests was 81%, 75% and 73% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No other individual
country’s revenues exceeded 10% in any of our last three years.

of $7.1 billion and $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have seven ships with Marshall Island registry
with a carrying value of $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 and six ships with Marshall Island registry with a carrying
value of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2015. We also have one ship with U.S. registry with a
carrying value of $0.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Recently Issued Accounting Policies

In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-04 which simplifies the test for goodwill
impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the
implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The guidance is effective for
annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim
or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not expect to early adopt this guidance.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 which amends Topic 230 (Statement
of Cash Flows) to eliminate discrepancies in reporting certain items in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted.
The transition should be made using a retrospective approach. We do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will be material
to our consolidated statements of cash flows.

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 which
addresses improvements to the guidance on revenue from contracts from customers regarding collectability, noncash consideration,
and completed contracts at transition. Additionally, it provides a

F-



practical expedient for contract modifications at
transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from
customers. The effective date of this guidance is upon adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 which is presented below. We are currently evaluating
the impact of the adoption of this guidance to our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11 which
is a rescission of Securities and Exchange Commission guidance related to the issuance of ASU No. 2014-09 which is presented below.
The effective date of this guidance is upon adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of this guidance to our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 which
does not change the core principle of the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 but clarifies two aspects: identifying performance obligations
and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The effective date of this guidance
is upon adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance to our consolidated
financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 to
improve multiple aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted. We do
not believe that the adoption of this guidance will be material to our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract
(i.e. lessees and lessors). The ASU requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights
and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The ASU further modifies lessors’ classification
criteria for leases and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The ASU will also require qualitative and
quantitative disclosures designed to give financial statement users additional information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty
of cash flows arising from leases. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual
periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The ASU is to be applied using a modified retrospective
approach.  We are currently reviewing our existing leases to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance to
our consolidated financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11 to
simplify the measurement of inventory for all entities. This applies to all inventory that is measured using either the first-in,
first-out or average cost method. The guidance requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable
value. The guidance must be applied prospectively and will be effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We have evaluated
the impact of the adoption of this guidance to our consolidated financial statements and there will not be a material impact to
our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05 to
clarify a customer’s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amendments provide guidance to customers
about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license or if the arrangement should be accounted for as a service
contract. This guidance will impact the accounting of software licenses but will not change a customer’s accounting for service
contracts. The guidance will be effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning
after December 15, 2015. We have adopted this guidance and there has not been an impact to our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 which
requires entities to recognize revenue through the application of a five-step model, including identification of the contract,
identification of the performance obligations, determination of the transaction price, allocation of the transaction price to the
performance obligation and recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligations. Entities have the option
of using either a full retrospective or a modified approach to adopt the guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14
deferring the effective date for one year. We can elect to adopt the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09 for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period or we can elect to early adopt the guidance as of
the original effective date. We expect to adopt a modified retrospective application for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017. We have initiated an assessment of our systems, data and processes related to the implementation of this guidance. This
assessment is expected to be completed during 2017. Additionally, we are currently evaluating our performance obligations and believe
that our application of the guidance will not result in a material change to our revenue recognition.

The Acquisition of Prestige

On September 2, 2014, NCLH entered into an
agreement with funds affiliated with Apollo and other owners to acquire 100% of the equity of Prestige. On November 19, 2014, we
completed the Acquisition of Prestige.

The Acquisition of Prestige and the principal factors
that contributed to the recognition of goodwill are enhancements of our financial profile which created a company with increased
economies of scale, greater operating leverage and synergies. These synergies include revenue enhancements and opportunities for
savings in various areas. The Acquisition of Prestige also created a company with greater cash flow generation, accelerating the
ability to delever our balance sheet.

Consideration for the Acquisition of Prestige consisted
of $1.1 billion in cash and non-cash considerations of 19,969,889 NCLH ordinary shares valued at $834.1 million based on the closing
market price of NCLH’s shares as of November 18, 2014 and contingent consideration valued at $43.4 million. In addition,
we assumed debt of $1.6 billion from Prestige. The contingent consideration arrangement subjected NCLH to an additional cash payment
of up to $50 million upon achievement of certain 2015 revenue milestones. The contingent consideration was valued using various
projected 2015 revenue scenarios weighted by the likelihood of each scenario occurring. The probability weighted payout was then
discounted at an appropriate discount rate commensurate for the risk of meeting the probabilistic cash flows. For more on the contingent
consideration valuation, we refer you to “Valuation of Contingent Consideration” below.

F-



Prestige is reported in our results of operations
from the acquisition date which includes approximately $111.7 million of revenue and approximately $19.7 million of operating loss
related to Prestige for the period ended December 31, 2014.

The excess of the cost of acquisition over the net
of amounts assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill, which is not
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Based on this fair valuation, the purchase price
was allocated as follows (in thousands):

related to the backlog intangible asset in the year ended December 31, 2013.

Valuation of Contingent Consideration

The contingent consideration was valued using various
projected 2015 Net Revenue scenarios weighted by the likelihood of each scenario occurring. The probability-weighted payout was
then discounted at an appropriate discount rate commensurate for

F-



the risk of meeting the probabilistic cash flows.
As the fair value was measured based upon significant inputs that are unobservable in the market, it was classified as Level 3
in the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 consists of significant unobservable inputs we believe market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability based on the best information available. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement
of the Company’s contingent consideration are the estimated annual Net Revenue and the probabilities associated with attaining
the threshold and target Net Revenue as defined by the Merger Agreement. A significant increase in the estimated Net Revenue or
an increase in the probability associated with reaching the target could have resulted in a significantly higher fair value measurement.
The maximum fair value would not be able to exceed $50 million, while an amount of Net Revenue less than 98% of target would result
in no payout. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the fair value of the contingent consideration was reduced to zero based upon
updates to the probability-weighted assessment of various projected revenue scenarios. The Net Revenue target was not met, and
accordingly, we recognized a $43.4 million fair value adjustment during the year ended December 31, 2015, which was included in
marketing, general and administrative expense.

value of the contingent consideration liability (in thousands):

The increase in ships was primarily due
to the additions of Seven Seas Explorer and Sirena. Depreciation and amortization
expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $432.5 million, $432.1 million and $273.1 million, respectively.
Repairs and maintenance expenses including Dry-dock expenses were $155.4 million, $124.8 million and $69.9 million for the years
ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively and were recorded within other cruise operating expense.

Ships under construction include progress payments
to the shipyard, planning and design fees, loan interest and commitment fees and other associated costs. The interest costs capitalized
were primarily associated with the construction or revitalization of ships which amounted to $33.7 million, $31.9 million and $22.0
million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

In June 2016, NCLC and Voyager Vessel Company, LLC,
subsidiaries of NCLH, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility”)
with a syndicate of banks which restates the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2014 (the “Existing
Senior Secured Credit Facility”). The Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility amends the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility
to, among other things, (i) (a) increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the Revolving Loan Facility from $625.0 million
to $750.0 million (the “New Revolving Loan Facility”) and (b) increase the aggregate principal amount outstanding under
the $1.38 billion term loan facility from $1.16 billion to $1.51 billion (the “New Term Loan A Facility”) and (ii)
extend the maturity of the New Term Loan A Facility and the New Revolving Loan Facility to June 2021 (the “Extended Maturity
Date”). The agreement incorporates a springing maturity date for the New Term Loan A Facility and the New Revolving Loan
Facility such that both mature on the earlier date that is 91 days prior to the final maturity date of NCLC’s $600.0 million
aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the “4.625% Notes”) if on such date (x) the 4.625%
Notes have not been repaid (or refinanced with indebtedness maturing after the Extended Maturity Date) by such date and (y) free
liquidity does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% Notes by at least $50.0 million. NCLC used proceeds
of approximately $1.59 billion from the New Term Loan A Facility and the New Revolving Loan Facility to prepay the entire outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Loan Facility, the $1.38 billion term loan facility and the $350.0 million term loan facility.

The New Term Loan A Facility and New Revolving Loan
Facility bear interest at a rate per annum of (a) an adjusted LIBOR rate or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the greatest
of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate in effect on such day and (iii) the adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1%,
in each case plus an applicable margin that is determined by reference to a total leverage ratio, with an applicable margin of
between 2.25% and 1.50% with respect to Eurocurrency loans and between 1.25% and 0.50% with respect to base rate loans. The initial
applicable margin for borrowings is 2.25% with respect to Eurocurrency borrowings and 1.25% with respect to base rate borrowings.
The New Term Loan A Facility is paid in quarterly installments which commenced in September 2016, in a principal amount equal to
(a) in the case of installments payable on or prior to June 6, 2018, 1.25% of the loans outstanding immediately after the closing
date under the New Term Loan A Facility and (b) in the case of installments payable after June 6, 2018, 2.50% of the loans outstanding
immediately after the closing date under the New Term Loan A Facility, with the remaining unpaid principal amount of loans under
the New Term Loan A Facility due and payable in full at maturity on June 6, 2021. Principal amounts outstanding under the New Revolving
Loan Facility are due and payable in full at maturity on June 6, 2021, subject to earlier repayment pursuant to the springing maturity
date described above.

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal
under the borrowings, we are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee at a rate determined by reference to a total leverage
ratio, with a maximum commitment fee of 40% of the applicable margin for Eurocurrency loans.

In July 2016, Breakaway Four, Ltd., as borrower,
and NCLC, as guarantor, entered into a Supplemental Agreement, which amended the Breakaway four loan to, among other things, increase
the aggregate principal amount of commitments under the multi-draw term loan credit facility from €590.5 million to €729.9
million.

In June 2016, we took delivery of Seven Seas Explorer.
To finance the payment due upon delivery, we had export credit financing in place for 80% of the contract price. The associated
$373.6 million term loan bears interest at 3.43% with a maturity date of June 30, 2028. Principal and interest payments shall be
paid semiannually.

In December 2016, NCLC issued $700.0 million aggregate
principal amount of 4.750% senior unsecured notes due December 2021 (the “Notes”) in a private offering (the “Offering”)
at par. NCLC used the net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting

F-



the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated
fees and expenses, together with cash on hand, to purchase its outstanding 5.25% senior notes due 2019 having an aggregate outstanding
principal amount of $680 million. The redemption of the 5.25% senior notes due 2019 was completed in January 2017.

NCLC will pay interest on the Notes at 4.750% per
annum, semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2017, to holders of record at the close of
business on the immediately preceding June 1 and December 1, respectively. NCLC may redeem the Notes, in whole or part, at any
time prior to December 15, 2018, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but not including, the redemption date and a “make-whole premium.” NCLC may redeem the Notes, in whole
or in part, on or after December 15, 2018, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Notes. At any time
(which may be more than once) on or prior to December 15, 2018, NCLC may choose to redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 104.750% of the face amount thereof with an amount equal to the net proceeds
of one or more equity offerings, so long as at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued remains outstanding
following such redemption. The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that limit NCLC’s ability (and its restricted
subsidiaries’ ability) to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred
shares; (ii) pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments; (iii) create restrictions on the payment of dividends or
other distributions to NCLC from its restricted subsidiaries; (iv) create liens on certain assets to secure debt; (v) make certain
investments; (vi) engage in transactions with affiliates; (vii) engage in sales of assets and subsidiary stock; and (viii) transfer
all or substantially all of its assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions. The indenture governing the Notes also
provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium (if any), interest
and other monetary obligations on all of the then-outstanding Notes to become due and payable immediately.

Interest expense, net for the year ended December
31, 2016 was $276.9 million which included $34.7 million of amortization of deferred financing fees and a $27.7 million loss on
extinguishment of debt. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $221.9 million which included $36.7
million of amortization of deferred financing fees and a $12.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt. Interest expense, net for
the year ended December 31, 2014 was $151.8 million which included $32.3 million of amortization of deferred financing fees and
$15.4 million of expenses related to financing transactions in connection with the Acquisition of Prestige.

Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants
that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity, as well as limit our net funded debt-to-capital
ratio, maintain certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends. Substantially all of our ships and other property
and equipment are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt. We believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of December
31, 2016.

In December 2015, we repurchased 348,553 ordinary
shares under NCLH’s repurchase program as a part of a Secondary Equity Offering by the Apollo Holders and Genting HK for
approximately $20.0 million.

In September 2014, NCLH entered into the Merger
Agreement with funds affiliated with Apollo and other owners for total consideration of $3.025 billion (including assumption of
debt) in cash and stock. On November 19, 2014, we completed the Acquisition of Prestige.

In June 2012, we exercised our option with Genting
HK to purchase Norwegian Sky. The purchase price was $259.3 million, which consisted of a $50.0 million cash payment and a $209.3
million payable to Genting HK, $79.7 million of such amount was paid to Genting HK within fourteen days of the consummation of
the IPO, together with accrued interest thereon, and the remaining balance was repaid over seven equal semi-annual payments the
first of which was due and paid in June 2013 and had a weighted-average interest rate of 1.52% through maturity. The fair value
of the payable was $205.5 million based on discounting the future payments at an imputed interest rate of 2.26% per annum,
which was commensurate with the Company’s borrowing rate for similar assets. The payable was collateralized by a mortgage
and an interest in all earnings, proceeds of insurance and certain other interests related to the ship and is included in the balance
sheet caption “Due to Affiliate” on our consolidated balance sheets. We have paid the total amount of $259.3 million
to Genting HK in connection with the Norwegian Sky Purchase Agreement through December 31, 2016 and no further payments are
due.

Fair Value Measurements
and Derivatives

Fair value is defined as the price at which an orderly
transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under
current market conditions (that is, an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds
the asset or owes the liability).

Fair Value Hierarchy

The following hierarchy for inputs used in measuring
fair value should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most
observable inputs be used when available:

Level 1

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement dates.

Level 2

Significant other observable inputs that are used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources.

Level 3

Significant unobservable inputs we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available.

Derivatives

We are exposed to market risk attributable to changes
in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of
our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives. We assess whether derivatives used in hedging
transactions are “highly effective” in offsetting changes in the cash flow of our hedged forecasted transactions. We
use regression analysis for this hedge relationship and high effectiveness is achieved when a statistically valid relationship
reflects a high degree of offset and correlation between the fair values of the derivative and the hedged forecasted transaction.
Cash flows from the derivatives are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying hedged transaction. The
determination of ineffectiveness is based on the amount of dollar offset between the cumulative change in fair value of the derivative
and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged transaction at the end of the reporting period. If it is determined that
a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, then
the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is released to earnings. In addition, the ineffective portion
of our highly effective hedges is recognized in earnings immediately and reported in other income (expense), net in our consolidated
statements of operations. There are no amounts

F-



excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
and there are no credit-risk-related contingent features in our derivative agreements.

We monitor concentrations of credit risk associated
with financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business. Credit risk, including but not limited to counterparty
non-performance under derivatives and our New Revolving Loan Facility, is not considered significant, as we primarily conduct business
with large, well-established financial institutions that we have established relationships with and that have credit risks acceptable
to us or the credit risk is spread out among a large number of creditors. We do not anticipate non-performance by any of our significant
counterparties.  The following table sets forth our derivatives measured at fair value and discloses the balance sheet location

The fair values of swap and forward contracts are
determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly
quoted markets. The Company determines the value of options and collars utilizing an option pricing model based on inputs
that are either readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets. The
option pricing model used by the Company is an industry standard model for valuing options and is used by the broker/dealer community.
The inputs to this option pricing model are the option strike price, underlying price, risk-free rate of interest, time to expiration,
and volatility. The fair value of option contracts considers both the intrinsic value and any remaining time value associated with
those derivatives that have not yet settled. The Company also considers counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk in its
determination of all estimated fair values. Our derivatives and financial instruments were categorized as Level 2 in the fair value
hierarchy, and we had no derivatives or financial instruments categorized as Level 1 or Level 3.

Our derivative contracts include rights of offset
with our counterparties. We have elected to net certain assets and liabilities within counterparties when the rights of offset
exist. We are not required to post cash collateral related to our derivative instruments.

Foreign Currency Options

We had foreign currency options that matured which
consisted of call options with deferred premiums. These options were used to mitigate the financial impact of volatility in foreign
currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros. If the spot rate at the date the ships
were delivered was less than the strike price under these option contracts, we would have paid the deferred premium and would not
exercise the foreign currency options.

The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated
balance sheets of all other financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value.

Long-Term Debt

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair
value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $6,525.7 million and $6,495.5 million, respectively, which was
$11.6 million higher and $6.6 million lower, respectively, than the carrying values. The difference between the fair value and
carrying value of our long-term debt is due to our fixed and variable rate debt obligations carrying interest rates that are above
or below market rates at the measurement dates. The fair value of our long-term debt was calculated based on estimated rates for
the same or similar instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities resulting in Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.
Market risk associated with our long-term variable rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in
interest rates. The calculation of the fair value of our long-term debt is considered a Level 2 input.

Non-recurring Measurements of Non-financial
Assets

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets, principally
tradenames, are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would
indicate that the carrying value of these assets could not be fully recovered.

We believe our estimates and judgments with respect
to our long-lived assets, principally ships, and goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable. Nonetheless,
if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in
the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets, we could be required to record an impairment charge. We estimate fair
value based on the best information available making whatever estimates, judgments and projections considered necessary. For our
Step I Test, the estimation of fair value measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with
the risk involved are considered Level 3 inputs. As of December 31, 2016, our annual review supports the carrying value of
these assets.

Employee Benefits and
Share-Based Compensation

Management NCL Corporation Units

In 2009, we adopted a profits sharing
agreement which authorized us to grant profits interests in the Company to certain key employees. These interests generally
vested with the holders based on a combination of performance-based and time-based vesting metrics, each as specified in the
profits sharing agreement and each holder’s award agreement. Genting HK, the Apollo Holders and the TPG Viking Funds
were entitled to initially receive any distributions made by the Company, pro-rata based on their shareholdings in the
Company. Once Genting HK, the Apollo Holders and the TPG Viking Funds received distributions in excess of certain hurdle
amounts specified in the profits sharing agreement and each holder’s award agreement, each vested profits interest
award generally entitled the holder of such award to a portion of such excess distribution amount. In connection with the
Corporate Reorganization, NCLC’s outstanding profits interests granted under its profits sharing agreement to
management (or former management) of NCLC were exchanged for an economically equivalent number of NCL Corporation Units. We
refer to the NCL Corporation Units exchanged for profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement as
“Management NCL Corporation Units.” The Management NCL Corporation Units received upon the exchange of
outstanding profits interests were subject to the same time-based vesting requirements and performance-based vesting
requirements applicable to the profits interests for which they were exchanged.

We accounted for the exchange of the outstanding
profits interests for the economically equivalent number of Management NCL Corporation Units and share-based option awards as an
award modification. An award modification requires that the fair value of the awards immediately before the modification and immediately
after the modification be determined. We engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist in the completion of a valuation which
was derived using a binomial lattice model. It was determined that the post-modification award value derived greater value versus
the pre-modification award value, resulting in the recognition of incremental compensation expense. At the date of award modification,
approximately $5.5 million of incremental cost associated with vested awards was charged to share-based compensation, with the
remaining unvested portion to be charged over the remaining vesting period.

The Management NCL Corporation Units, generally
consisted of fifty percent of “Time-Based Units” (“TBUs”) and fifty percent of “Performance-Based
Units” (“PBUs”). The TBUs generally vested over five years and upon a distribution event, the vesting amount
of the PBUs was based on the amount of proceeds that are realized above certain hurdles.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, all Management NCL
Corporation Units were exchanged for NCLH ordinary shares and restricted shares under a management exchange agreement (the “Management
Exchange Agreement”). NCLH became the sole member and 100% owner of the economic interests in NCLC and the non-controlling
interest no longer exists as of December 31, 2014. Accordingly, NCLC is now treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. No new NCLC profits interests or Management NCL Corporation Units will be issued; however, NCLH has granted, and
expects to continue to grant, equity to its employees and members of its Board of Directors under its long-term incentive plan.
The exchange for NCLH ordinary

F-



shares and restricted shares, per the Management
Exchange Agreement, resulted in no incremental expense after applying the modification accounting treatment as substantially all
key terms and conditions remained consistent.

As a result of a Secondary Equity Offering during
August 2015, the last hurdle amount specified in the profits sharing agreement was reached and as such all outstanding PBUs vested.

The termination of employment may result in forfeiture
of any non-vested TBUs. TBUs that were vested can be either continued by the Company or cancelled and paid to the employee. Cancellation
could take place any time after termination but not before two years after the grant date.

Amended and Restated 2013 Performance Incentive
Plan (“Restated 2013 Plan”)

In January 2013, the Company adopted the 2013 Performance
Incentive Plan which provided for the issuance of up to 15,035,106 of NCLH’s ordinary shares pursuant to awards granted under
the plan, with no more than 5,000,000 shares being granted to one individual in any calendar year. In May 2016, the plan was amended
and restated pursuant to approval from the Board of Directors and Company’s shareholders. Among other things, under the Restated
2013 Plan, the number of the Company’s ordinary shares that may be delivered pursuant to all awards granted under the plan
was increased by an additional 12,430,000 shares to a new maximum aggregate limit of 27,465,106 shares. Additionally, the expiration
date of the Restated 2013 Plan was extended to March 30, 2026. Share options under the plan are granted with an exercise price
equal to the closing market price of NCLH shares at the date of grant. The vesting period for time-based options is typically set
at 3, 4 or 5 years with a contractual life ranging from 7 to 10 years. The vesting period for time-based restricted share units
is generally 3 years. In connection with an amendment to our President and Chief Executive Officer’s employment agreement
in August 2015, the Company awarded time-based, performance-based and market-based options and restricted stock unit awards to
our President and Chief Executive Officer which vest upon the satisfaction of the specified performance period or the achievement
of certain performance and market-related metrics during the term of the award agreements. Forfeited awards will be available for
subsequent awards under the Restated 2013 Plan.

Share Option Awards

In March 2016, we granted 1.0 million share option
awards to our employees at an exercise price of $50.31 with a contractual term of ten years. The share options vest equally over
three years.

The fair value of each time-based option award is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The estimated fair value of the share options, less
estimated forfeitures, is amortized over the vesting period using the straight-line vesting method. The assumptions used within
the option-pricing model for the time-based awards are as follows:

6.25 years

Expected volatility was determined based on the historical
share prices in our industry. The risk-free rate was based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the
expected option term at grant date. The expected term was calculated under the simplified method. Our forfeiture assumption is
derived from historical turnover rates and those estimates are revised as appropriate to reflect the actual forfeiture results.

The performance-based awards awarded to our President
and Chief Executive Officer are subject to performance conditions such that the number of awards that ultimately vest depends on
the adjusted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”) and adjusted return on invested capital (“Adjusted ROIC”)
achieved by the Company during the performance period compared to targets established at the award date. Because the terms of the
performance-based awards provide discretion to make certain adjustments to the performance calculation, the service inception date
of these awards precedes the grant date. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense beginning on the service inception
date and remeasures the fair value of the awards until a grant date is established. The estimate of the awards’ fair value
will be fixed in the period in which the grant date occurs, and cumulative compensation expense will be adjusted based on the fair
value calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the grant date. The fair value for the option awards for which
a grant date has not been established is estimated on the last date of the reporting period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The estimated fair value of the share options is amortized over the requisite service period using the straight-line vesting
method. The assumptions used within the option-pricing model for the performance-based awards for which share-based compensation
expense was recognized during 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

Expected volatility was determined based on the historical

expected option term at grant date. The expected term was calculated under the simplified method.

The fair value of the market-based share option
awards awarded to our President and Chief Executive Officer is estimated using a Monte-Carlo model which values financial instruments
whose value is dependent on share price by sampling random paths for share price. The key inputs for the simulation include current
share price, risk free rate, and share price volatility. For each simulated path, the model checks if the simulated share price
reaches the vesting threshold during the performance period. For each path that reaches the vesting threshold, the payoff upon
vesting is calculated. The fair value of the equity grant is determined by averaging the expected payoff across all simulated paths
and discounting the average to the valuation date.

the Monte-Carlo simulation:

Agreement, which maintain their original vesting conditions of time and performance, vest in substantially equal quarterly installments
over 1 or 2 years or in annual installments over 4 years. The total fair value of shares vested during 2016, 2015, and 2014 was
$1.1 million, $40.9 million, and $0.7 million, respectively.

Restricted Share Units (“RSUs”)

In March 2016, we granted 1.2 million restricted share
unit awards to our employees which vest equally over three years.

The fair value of the time-based and performance-based
RSUs is equal to the closing market price of NCLH shares at the date of grant.  The performance-based RSUs awarded to our
President and Chief Executive Officer are subject to performance conditions such that the number of awards that ultimately vest
depends on the Adjusted EPS and Adjusted ROIC achieved by the Company during the performance period compared to targets established
at the award date. Because the terms of the performance-based awards provide discretion to make certain adjustments to the performance
calculation, the service inception date of these awards precedes the grant date. Accordingly, the Company recognizes share-based
compensation expense beginning on the service inception date and remeasures the fair value of the awards until a grant date occurs.
The estimate of the awards’ fair value will be fixed in the period in which the grant date occurs, and cumulative share-based
compensation expense will be adjusted based on the fair value at the grant date.

The fair value of the market-based RSUs awarded
to our President and Chief Executive Officer is estimated using a Monte-Carlo model which values financial instruments whose value
is dependent on share price by sampling random paths for share price. The key inputs for the simulation include current share price,
risk free rate, and share price volatility. For each simulated path, the model checks if the simulated share price reaches the

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)

In April 2014, the Company’s shareholders approved
the ESPP. The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to purchase NCLH’s ordinary shares
at a favorable price and upon favorable terms in consideration of the participating employees’ continued services. A maximum
of 2,000,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares may be purchased under the ESPP. To be eligible to participate in an offering
period, on the Grant Date of that period, an individual must be customarily employed by the Company or a participating subsidiary
for more than twenty hours per week and for more than five months per calendar year. Participation in the ESPP is also subject
to certain limitations. The ESPP is considered to be compensatory based on: a) the 15% purchase price discount and b) the look-back
purchase price feature. Since the plan is compensatory, compensation expense must be recorded in the consolidated statements of
operations on a straight-line basis over the six-month withholding period. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a $1.3 million
and $1.1 million liability, respectively, for payroll withholdings received.

The compensation expense recognized for share-based
compensation for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows:

Employee Benefit Plans

We maintain annual incentive bonus plans for our
executive officers and other key employees. Bonuses under these plans become earned and payable based on the Company’s performance
during the applicable performance period and the individual’s continued employment. Company performance criteria include
the attainment of certain financial targets and other strategic objectives.

Certain employees are employed pursuant to agreements
that provide for severance payments. Severance is generally only payable upon an involuntary termination of the employment by us
without cause or a termination by the employee for good reason. Severance generally includes a series of cash payments based on
the employee’s base salary (and in some cases, bonus), and our payment of the employee’s continued medical benefits
for the applicable severance period.

We maintain a 401(k) Plan for our shoreside employees,
including our executive officers. Participants may contribute up to 100% of eligible compensation each pay period, subject to certain
limitations. We make matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 3% and 50% of amounts greater than 3% to and including 10%
of each participant’s contributions subject to certain limitations. In addition, we may make discretionary supplemental contributions
to the Plan, which shall be allocated to each eligible participant on a pro-rata basis based on the compensation of the participant
to the total compensation of all participants. Our matching contributions are vested according to a five-year schedule. The 401(k)
Plan is subject to the provisions of ERISA and is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
(the “Code”).

Our contributions are reduced by contributions forfeited
by those employees who leave the 401(k) Plan prior to vesting fully in the contributions. Forfeited contributions of $0.1 million,
$0.4 million and $0.1 million were utilized in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

We maintained a Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan (“SERP”), which is a legacy unfunded defined contribution plan for certain executives who were employed by the
Company in an executive capacity prior to 2008. The SERP was frozen to future

F-



participation following that date. The SERP provided
for Company contributions on behalf of the participants to compensate them for the benefits that are limited under the 401(k) Plan.
We credited participants under the SERP for amounts that would have been contributed by us to the Company’s previous Defined
Contribution Retirement Plan and the former 401(k) Plan without regard to any limitations imposed by the Code. Participants did
not make any elective contributions under this plan. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the aggregate balance of participants’
deferred compensation accounts under the SERP Plan was $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively. We have discontinued this plan
following the 2015 contributions and will pay the deferred contributions to participants in early 2017 following the expiration
of the required twelve month period.

We recorded expenses related to the above 401(k)
Plan and SERP of $6.4 million, $5.3 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

We maintained a Senior Management Retirement Savings
Plan (“SMRSP”), which was a legacy unfunded defined contribution plan for certain employees who were employed by the
Company prior to 2001. The SMRSP provided for Company contributions on behalf of the participants to compensate them for the difference
between the qualified plan benefits that were previously available under the Company’s cash balance pension plan and the
redesigned 401(k) Plan. We credited participants under the SMRSP Plan for the difference in the amount that would have been contributed
by us to the Company’s previous Norwegian Cruise Line Pension Plan and the qualified plan maximums of the new 401(k) Plan.
We have discontinued this plan following the 2015 contributions and will pay the deferred contributions to participants in early
2017 following the expiration of the required twelve month period.

Effective January 2009, we implemented the Shipboard
Retirement Plan which computes benefits based on years of service, subject to eligibility requirements of the Shipboard Retirement
Plan. The Shipboard Retirement Plan is unfunded with no plan assets. The current portion of the projected benefit obligation of
$1.2 million and $1.1 million was included in accrued expenses and other liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively
and $21.4 million and $20.0 million was included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The amounts related to the Shipboard Retirement Plan were as follows (in thousands):

loss is amortized over 18.89 years. The discount rate is used to measure and recognize obligations, including adjustments to other
comprehensive income (loss), and to determine expense during the periods. It is determined by using bond indices which reflect
yields on a broad maturity and industry universe of high-quality corporate bonds.

Income Taxes

We are incorporated in Bermuda. Under current Bermuda
law, we are not subject to tax on income and capital gains. We have received from the Minister of Finance under The Exempted Undertakings
Tax Protection Act 1966, as amended, an assurance that, in the event that Bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on profits,
income, any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance, then the imposition of
any such tax shall not be applicable to us or to any of our operations or shares, debentures or other obligations, until March 31,
2035.

We have U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of
$256.3 million and $197.0 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which begin to expire in 2023.
We have state net operating loss carryforwards of $12.4 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, which expire in the years 2025 through 2035. In 2016, based on the weight of available evidence, we reversed a valuation
allowance in the amount of $3.6 million with respect to the U.S. deferred tax assets of one of our U.S. subsidiaries.

Included above are deferred tax assets associated
with our operations in Norway for which we have provided a full valuation allowance. We have Norway net operating loss carryforwards
of $22.9 million and $35.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which can be carried forward indefinitely.

Included above are deferred tax assets associated
with our branch operations in the U.K. for which we have provided a full valuation allowance. We have U.K. net operating loss carryforwards
of $9.5 million and $12.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which can be carried forward indefinitely.

On November 19, 2014, we acquired the stock of Prestige.
Included above are deferred tax assets associated with Prestige, including net operating loss carryforwards of $151.2 million and
$126.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which begin to expire in 2023. In 2014, we recorded
a valuation allowance of $36.5 million with respect to the Prestige deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence.
Section 382 of the Code may limit the amount of taxable income that can be offset by the Prestige NOL carryforwards.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the
total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):

If the $11.1 million unrecognized tax benefits at
December 31, 2016 were recognized, our effective tax rate would be affected. We believe it is reasonably possible that the
expiration of statute of limitations could result in significant reductions to our unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of
the reporting date. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction,
various U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. We are generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local,
or non-U.S. income tax examinations by authorities for years prior to 2011, except for years in which NOLs generated prior to 2011
are utilized.

Due to our international structure as well as the
existence of international tax treaties that exempt taxation on certain activities, the repatriation of earnings from our subsidiaries
would have no tax impact.

We derive our income from the international operation
of ships. We are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. and receive income from sources within the U.S. Under Section 883,
certain foreign corporations are exempt from U. S. federal income or branch profits tax on U.S.-source income derived from or incidental
to the international operation of ships. Applicable U.S. treasury regulations provide that a foreign corporation will qualify for
the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part: (i) the foreign country in which the corporation is organized grants an equivalent
exemption for income from the operation of ships of sufficiently broad scope to corporations organized in the U.S., and (ii) the
foreign corporation has one or more classes of stock that are “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities
market” in the U.S. or another qualifying country. We believe that we qualify for the benefits of Section 883 because we
are incorporated in qualifying countries and our ordinary shares are primarily and regularly traded on an established securities
market in the U.S.

Commitments and Contingencies

Operating Leases

Total expense under non-cancelable operating lease
commitments, primarily for offices, motor vehicles and office equipment was $15.0 million, $12.6 million and $9.2 million for the
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, minimum annual rentals for non-cancelable
leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands):

Ship Construction Contracts

We have Norwegian Joy, Norwegian Bliss and one additional
Breakaway Plus Class Ship on order for delivery in the spring of 2017, spring of 2018 and the fall of 2019, respectively. These
ships will be amongst the largest in our fleet, each reaching approximately 164,600 Gross Tons. The combined contract price of
these three ships is approximately €2.6 billion, or $2.7 billion based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December
31, 2016. We have export credit financing in place that provides financing for 80% of their contract prices. We have an Explorer
Class Ship on order with an original contract price of approximately €422.0 million, or approximately $443.8 million based
on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2016. We have export credit financing in place that provides financing
for 80% of the contract price. The Explorer Class Ship is expected to be delivered in the winter of 2020.

In connection with the contracts to build the ships,
we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellation to occur. However, if any would occur, it could result in, among
other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially
impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Other Commitments

The FMC requires evidence of financial responsibility
for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of U.S. ports to indemnify passengers in the event of non-performance
of the transportation. Accordingly, each of our three brands are required to maintain a $30.0 million third-party performance guarantee
in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations to passengers. The guarantee requirements
are subject to additional consumer price index-based adjustments. Also, our brands have a legal requirement to maintain a security
guarantee based on cruise business originated from the U.K. As of December 31, 2016, approximately British Pound Sterling 10.5
million was in place as a security guarantee. We also are required to establish financial responsibility by other jurisdictions
to meet liability in the event of non-performance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions.

From time to time, various other regulatory and
legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the U.S. and the cruise
industry in general.

F-



Litigation

In the normal course of our business, various claims
and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us. Most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and, accordingly,
the maximum amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount.

Nonetheless, the ultimate outcome of these claims
and lawsuits that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time. We have evaluated our overall exposure with respect
to all of our threatened and pending litigation and, to the extent required, we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable
losses associated with our deemed exposure. We are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses beyond those
accrued, as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery.
However, based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that the aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses with
respect to these matters will be material to our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We intend
to vigorously defend our legal position on all claims and, to the extent necessary, seek recovery.

13.

Other Income (Expense),
Net

Other income (expense), net was $8.3 million in 2016,
$46.7 million in 2015 and $10.9 million in 2014. In 2016, the expense was primarily related to $16.1 million of unrealized and
realized losses on fuel swap derivative hedge contracts partially offset by $4.5 million of gains on foreign currency exchange
and $3.9 million of gains on foreign currency exchange derivative hedge contracts. In 2015, the expense was primarily related to
$30.7 million of losses from the dedesignation of certain fuel swap derivative hedge contracts and the ineffectiveness of settled
fuel swaps in 2015. Also included in 2015 was an expense of $26.2 million related to the fair value adjustment of a foreign exchange
collar which does not receive hedge accounting treatment partially offset by $11.0 million of foreign currency transaction gains.
In 2014, the expense was primarily related to $7.2 million of losses on foreign currency exchange derivative hedge contracts and
the fair value adjustment of a foreign exchange collar which does not receive hedge accounting treatment, $6.9 million of losses
related to fuel swap derivative hedge contracts and $3.0 million of losses related to a deferred revenue adjustment partially offset
by $6.0 million of gains on foreign currency exchange.

14.

Concentration Risk

We contract with a single vendor to provide many of our hotel and restaurant services including both food and labor costs. We incurred expenses of $137.2 million, $122.4 million and $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are recorded in payroll and related in our consolidated statements of operations.

15.

Supplemental Cash Flow
Information

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014, we paid interest and related fees of $303.2 million, $218.3 million and $233.5 million, respectively. For the year ended
December 31, 2016, we had non-cash investing activities in connection with property and equipment of $26.7 million and for the
year ended December 31, 2015, we had non-cash investing activities in connection with capital leases of $31.1 million. For the
year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 we had non-cash investing activities for capital expenditures of $41.1 million and $13.0
million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had a non-cash investing and financing activity related to a seller
financed capital expenditure of $82.0 million. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid income taxes of $8.8
million, $10.3 million and $9.8 million, respectively.

16.

Subsequent Events

In February 2017, we announced that we plan to introduce an additional four ships with expected delivery dates through
    2025 and we have an option to introduce two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027, subject to certain conditions.
    These four ships are each 140,000 gross tons with approximately 3,300 Berths. The contract price for each of the four ships
    is approximately €800.0 million, subject to certain conditions, or $841.4 million based on the exchange rate as of December
    31, 2016. We have obtained export credit financing for the four ships to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each
    ship expected to be delivered through 2025, subject to certain conditions.

The seasonality of the North American cruise industry
generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. This predictable seasonality
in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due
to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled Dry-docks, which we typically scheduled during non-peak demand periods.
