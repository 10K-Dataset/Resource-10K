PART I

Item 1. Business

History and Development of the Company

We are a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian
Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. As of December 31, 2017, we had 25 ships with approximately
50,400 Berths. We plan to introduce seven additional ships through 2025 and we have an option to introduce two additional ships
for delivery in 2026 and 2027, subject to certain conditions.

Norwegian commenced operations from Miami in 1966. In February
2000, Genting HK acquired control of and subsequently became the sole owner of the Norwegian operations.

In January 2008, the Apollo Holders acquired 50% of the outstanding
ordinary share capital of NCLC. As part of this investment, the Apollo Holders assumed control of NCLC’s Board of Directors.
Also, in January 2008, the TPG Viking Funds acquired, in the aggregate, 12.5% of NCLC’s outstanding share capital from the
Apollo Holders.

In February 2011, NCLH, a Bermuda limited company, was formed
with the issuance to the Sponsors of, in aggregate, 10,000 ordinary shares, with a par value of $.001 per share. In January 2013,
NCLH completed its IPO, pursuant to which it sold 27,058,824 ordinary shares for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and expenses, of approximately $473.9 million. In connection with the consummation of the IPO, the Sponsors’
ordinary shares in NCLC were exchanged for the ordinary shares of NCLH, and NCLH became the owner of 100% of the ordinary shares
and parent company of NCLC (the “Corporate Reorganization”). At the same time, NCLH contributed $460.0 million to NCLC
and the historical financial statements of NCLC became those of NCLH. The Corporate Reorganization was effected solely for the
purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure. NCLH had not, prior to the completion of the Corporate Reorganization, conducted
any activities other than those incidental to its formation and to prepare for the Corporate Reorganization and the IPO.

In November 2014, we completed the Acquisition of Prestige.
We believe that the combination of Norwegian and Prestige creates a cruise operating company with a rich product portfolio and
strong market presence.

The Sponsors have completed numerous Secondary Equity Offerings
and as of December 31, 2017 have reduced their ownership to 16.8% of NCLH’s ordinary shares.

Additional Information

NCLH is a Bermuda exempted company formed as a holding company
in 2011, with predecessors dating from 1966. Our registered offices are located at Walkers Corporate (Bermuda) Limited, Park Place,

Our Company

Business Overview

We are a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian
Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. As of December 31, 2017, we had 25 ships with approximately
50,400 Berths. We plan to introduce seven additional ships through 2025 and we have an option to introduce two additional ships
for delivery in 2026 and 2027, subject to certain conditions. Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Encore are on order for delivery in
the spring of 2018 and fall of 2019, respectively. We also have an Explorer Class Ship, Seven Seas Splendor, on order for delivery
in the winter of 2020. Project Leonardo will introduce an additional four ships with expected delivery dates through 2025. These
additions to our fleet (exclusive of the option for two additional ships) will increase our total Berths to approximately 72,300.
Our brands offer itineraries to worldwide destinations including Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Africa, Canada,
Bermuda, Caribbean, Alaska and Hawaii. Norwegian’s U.S.-flagged ship, Pride of America, provides the industry’s only
entirely inter-island itinerary in Hawaii.

All of our brands offer an assortment of features, amenities
and activities, including a variety of accommodations, multiple dining venues, bars and lounges, spa, casino and retail shopping
areas and numerous entertainment choices. All brands also offer a selection of shore excursions at each port of call as well as
hotel packages for stays before or after a voyage.

An innovator in cruise travel, Norwegian operates 15 ships that
have been purpose-built to offer guests the freedom and flexibility to design their ideal cruise vacation on their schedule. Norwegian
invites guests to enjoy a relaxed, resort style cruise vacation on some of the newest and most contemporary ships at sea with a
wide variety of accommodation options, including, on certain ships, The Haven by Norwegian®, a luxury enclave with suites,
private pools and dining, concierge service and personal butlers, that offers a



“ship within a ship” experience. The additional
ships that we plan to add to our Norwegian fleet as part of Project Leonardo will introduce additional innovative features that
we believe will further elevate the guest experience. Norwegian has been named “North America’s Leading Cruise Line”
for the second time, along with being honored as the “Caribbean’s Leading Cruise Line” for the fifth consecutive
year and “Europe’s Leading Cruise Line” for the tenth consecutive year at the 2017 World Travel Awards. In 2016,
Norwegian also received awards for “World’s Leading Large Ship Cruise Line” for the fifth consecutive year and
“Europe’s Responsible Tourism Award” for the second consecutive year and the award for “World’s Best
Cruise Spa” for the Mandara Spa® on board Norwegian Cruise Line.

Oceania Cruises offers the finest cuisine at sea and immersive
destination experiences with destination-rich itineraries spanning the globe. Oceania Cruises operates a fleet of six mid-size
ships, including two 1,250-Berth O-Class Ships, and four 684-Berth R-Class Ships. Oceania Cruises is ranked as one of the world’s
best cruise lines by Condé Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure. Oceania Cruises was awarded “Best Cabins,” “Best
Dining,” “Best Fitness & Recreation,” “Best Public Rooms” and “Best Service” in the
Cruise Critic Cruisers’ Choice Awards for 2017 and “Best Luxury Cruise Line for Dining” in Cruise Critic Cruisers’
2016 Editors’ Picks along with “Best for Food,” “Best for On-Shore Excursions” and “Best for
Suites” in the 2016 Town & Country Cruise Awards. Also in 2017, Ensemble Travel ® Group awarded Oceania Cruises “Cruise
Partner of the Year” and “Marketing Partner of the Year.”

Regent Seven Seas Cruises is an all-inclusive cruise
line which provides all-suite accommodations, round-trip air transportation, highly personalized service, specialized
cuisine, fine wines and spirits, unlimited internet access, sightseeing excursions in every port and other amenities included
in the cruise fare. The brand operates four award-winning ships, totaling 2,640 Berths. Condé Nast Traveler named
Regent Seven Seas Cruises on its 2017 Gold List and among the World’s Best Medium- and Small-Ships Cruise Lines in its
2016 Readers’ Choice Awards. Regent Seven Seas Cruises also consistently places in Travel + Leisure’s top 5 Best
Ocean Cruise Lines with Midsized Ships and tops U.S. News & World Report’s best cruise lines rankings. In 2016,
Cruise Critic recognized Seven Seas Explorer as the Best New Luxury Ship and Porthole Cruise Magazine recognized Seven Seas
Explorer as the Best Luxury Ship. In 2017, TravAlliance recognized Seven Seas Explorer as the Best Luxury Ship.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that the following business strengths will enable
us to execute our strategy:

Rich Stateroom Mix

The Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent fleets offer an attractive
mix of staterooms, suites and villas. Norwegian’s accommodations include the groundbreaking Studio staterooms designed for
solo travelers centered around the Studio Lounge, a private lounge area solely for Studio guests, as well as ocean views, balconies,
and connecting accommodations to meet the needs of all types of cruisers. Norwegian’s suites range from two bedroom family
suites to penthouses and owner suites, as well as three bedroom Garden Villas measuring up to 6,694 square feet. In addition, nine
of Norwegian’s ships offer The Haven, a key-card access enclave on the upper decks with luxurious suite accommodations, exclusive
amenities, and 24/7 butler and concierge service. The Haven suites surround a private courtyard with pool, hot tubs, sundeck, fitness
center and steam rooms. Onboard Norwegian Epic, the Breakaway Class Ships and the Breakaway Plus Class Ships, The Haven also includes
a private lounge and fine dining restaurant.

The spacious and elegant accommodations on Oceania Cruises’
six award-winning ships, the 684-Berth Regatta, Insignia, Sirena and Nautica, and the 1,250-Berth Marina and Riviera,
range from 160-square foot inside staterooms to opulent 2,030-square foot owner suites. The Regent fleet is comprised of four ships
— Seven Seas Voyager, Seven Seas Mariner and Seven Seas Explorer feature all-suite, all-balcony accommodations and a majority
of the accommodations on Seven Seas Navigator include balconies.

High-Quality Service

The Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent brands all offer a
high level of onboard service. We collaborate amongst the brands to provide an enhanced guest experience across all brands. Norwegian
offers guests the freedom and flexibility to design their ideal cruise vacation on their schedule with no set dining times, a variety
of entertainment options and no formal dress codes. Oceania Cruises and Regent are known for their quality of service, including
some of the highest crew-to-guest ratios in the industry and a staff trained to deliver personalized and attentive service in a
country club, casual setting.

Diverse Selection of Premium Itineraries

We have expanded our already broad range of premium
itineraries. Our fleet has a worldwide deployment, offering a few days to 180-day itineraries, including destinations
in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, the Greek Isles, Alaska, Canada and New England, Asia, Tahiti and the South
Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, Africa, India, South America, the Panama Canal, and the Caribbean. We introduced a
new destination, Harvest Caye, in November 2016. This destination in Southern Belize features Belize’s only cruise
ship pier, expansive seven acre white sand beach, 15,000 sq. ft. pool with swim up bar, multiple dining options and a
nature center with wildlife experiences plus adventure tours.

Strong Cash Flow

We believe our business model will generate a significant amount
of cash flow with high revenue visibility. All three of our brands afford the ability to pre-sell tickets, receive customer deposits
and sell onboard activities in advance with long lead times ahead of sailing. In terms of newbuild capital expenditures, the cash
flow impact is mitigated as we have obtained export credit financing for the ships which is expected to fund approximately 80%
of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2025, subject to certain conditions.



Highly Experienced Management Team

Our senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive
experience in the cruise, travel, leisure and hospitality-related industries. Frank J. Del Rio is our President and Chief Executive

Our Business Strategies

Driving Demand

We seek to attract vacationers to our products and services
in several ways, including:

·

delivering an enhanced, value-added vacation experience to our guests relative to other vacation alternatives via our market-to-fill strategy;

·

creating diverse and unique itineraries in new and existing markets for our current and upcoming ships;

·

utilizing effective marketing and sales force initiatives; and

·

expanding internationally.

Our market-to-fill strategy, itinerary diversification, marketing
and sales force initiatives and international expansion strategies contribute to driving increased revenues for our fleet.  Our
market-to-fill strategy maintains pricing integrity by offering both the best price early in the booking cycle and value-added
promotions when necessary to mitigate the need to compromise on price.

Diversification of deployment is achieved by our destination
management team which reviews deployments across the fleet, either repositioning ships to new destinations or fine-tuning itineraries,
with the goal of creating product scarcity which, in turn, leads to higher pricing.

We also seek to increase demand through effective marketing
campaigns across various channels such as branding campaigns on nationwide television or targeted mail campaigns aimed at supporting
seasonal deployments. Our sales forces are also drivers of demand, particularly in terms of educating travel agents on our products
and services in order for them to better sell to potential vacationers.

Lastly, our international expansion efforts are aimed at increasing
brand awareness across the globe which allows us to diversify our guest sourcing.  We maintain numerous sales offices which
support sales and marketing efforts in various markets outside of North America including the United Kingdom, Europe, China, Australia,
Brazil, India, Japan and Singapore.

Leveraging Scale to Suppress Costs

We continue to leverage the combined purchasing power of our
three brands to reduce costs throughout the organization.  This initiative is bolstered by our Supply Chain and Logistics
Management function which supports our three brands as well as our corporate and international offices.

Enhanced Product Offerings and Guest Experience

Norwegian’s ships offer up to 28 dining options, a diverse
range of accommodations and what we believe is the widest array of entertainment at sea. Oceania Cruises’ award-winning onboard
dining, with multiple open seating dining venues, is a central highlight of its cruise experience. Regent’s all-inclusive
offering includes air transportation, shore excursions, hotel packages, specialty restaurants, premium spirits and fine wines,
gratuities, wi-fi and other amenities.

Maximize Revenue

We focus on growing revenue through various initiatives aimed
at increasing ticket prices and Occupancy Percentages as well as onboard spending to drive higher overall revenue. Our specific
initiatives include:



Strategic Relationships.

We have strategic
relationships with travel agencies and tour operators who commit to purchasing a certain level of inventory with long lead times.

Meetings, Incentives and Charters.

We maintain
our focus on the meetings, incentives and charters channel, which typically books very far in advance and can represent a significant
portion of the ship, or even an entire sailing, in one transaction.

Promotional Strategy.

With our Norwegian brand,
we utilize a more inclusive product offering on certain sailings and in certain cabin selections which provides guests a choice
of one to five onboard amenities.

Casino Player Strategy.

We have non-exclusive
arrangements with over 100 casino partners worldwide whereby loyal gaming guests are offered cruise reward certificates redeemable
for cruises. Through property sponsored events and joint marketing programs, we have the opportunity to market cruises to these
guests. These arrangements with casino partners have the dual benefit of filling open inventory and reaching guests expected to
generate above average onboard revenue through the casino and other onboard spending.

Optimization of Deployment.

We manage our ships’
deployment to promote better breadth of itineraries and to offer sailings further in advance.

Ship Refurbishments.

We have invested in revitalizations
to our ships which provides a product which we believe delivers higher guest satisfaction and, in turn, higher pricing.

Disciplined Fleet Expansion

We have Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Encore on order for delivery
in the spring of 2018 and the fall of 2019, respectively. These ships will be the largest in our fleet, each reaching approximately
164,600 Gross Tons. With approximately 3,770 to 4,000 Berths each, they will be similar in design to our first Breakaway Plus Class
Ship, Norwegian Escape, which was delivered in October 2015, and will include additional innovative features. We also have a contract
to build a second Explorer Class Ship, Seven Seas Splendor to be delivered in the winter of 2020. Project Leonardo consists of
four ships on order with expected delivery dates through 2025 with an option for two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and
2027, subject to certain conditions. The four Leonardo ships are each 140,000 gross tons with approximately 3,300 Berths. We have
obtained export credit financing for the ships which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship expected
to be delivered through 2025, subject to certain conditions. We believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the
reach of our brands, positioning us for accelerated growth and providing an optimized return on invested capital.

Expand and Strengthen Our Product Distribution Channels

As part of our growth strategy, we continually look for ways
to deepen and expand our sales channels. We continue to invest in our brands by enhancing websites and passenger services departments
through which travel agents and guests have the ability to book cruise vacations.

We focus on distribution through our three primary channels:
“Retail/Travel Agent,” “International,” and “Meetings, Incentives and Charters.”

Retail/Travel Agent.

The retail/travel agent
channel represents the majority of our ticket sales. Our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately
23,000 independent travel agencies including brick and mortar, internet-based and home-based operators located in North America,
South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. We have made substantial investments with improvements in booking technologies,
transparent pricing strategies, effective marketing tools, improved communication and cooperative marketing initiatives. We have
expanded sales force teams who work closely with our travel agency partners on maximizing their marketing and sales effectiveness
across all three of our brands. Our focused account management is designed to create solutions catered to the individual retailer
through product and sales training. This education creates a deeper understanding of all our offerings.

International.

The international channel
represents an underpenetrated channel of distribution and one that we have increased focus on since 2015.  Focus on this market
accomplishes the dual objective of allowing us to grow our yields and capacity faster than if we only focused on the North American
market while also allowing us to diversify our risk.  As part of this focus, we have undertaken a three-pronged strategy of:

·

expanding the management, sales and marketing teams that oversees this area,

·

broadening our travel agency distribution to multiple partners in each region, and

·

expanding the geographic reach of our product by deploying our ships in areas that appeal to international guests and by personalizing
our product for their tastes.

As part of this strategy, we have opened offices in
Sydney, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Tokyo, and Singapore and expanded or renovated our existing offices in Southampton,
Sao Paulo and Wiesbaden.



For information regarding risks associated with our
international operations, see Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor titled
“Conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks.”

Meetings, Incentives and Charters.

This channel
focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meetings and incentive travel. These sales often have very long lead times and
can fill a significant portion of the ship’s capacity, or even an entire sailing, in one transaction. The acquisition of
Sixthman in 2012, a company specializing in developing and delivering music-oriented charters, opened up a new market for travel
partners enabling travel partners to sell high-quality music experiences at sea to guests.

Itineraries

We offer cruise itineraries ranging from a few days to 180-days
calling on worldwide locations, including destinations in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, the Greek Isles, Alaska, Canada
and New England, Asia, Tahiti and the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, Africa, India, South America, the Panama Canal,
and the Caribbean. We have developed, and are continuing to develop, innovative itineraries to position our ships in new and niche
markets as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the world.

We believe that these destination-focused itineraries, complemented
by a comprehensive shore excursion program (which is included in the all-inclusive fare for cruises on the Regent ships), differentiate
our brands from many of our competitors. We call on varied destinations, many of which include overnight stays in port, allowing
guests to have more in-depth experiences than would otherwise be possible in only a single day port call.

For some of our longer itineraries, we strive to maximize profitability
by selling segments of the longer itineraries as shorter cruises (i.e., which last 7 to 20 days) in order to capture more time-constrained
customers. We believe the deployment flexibility created by the use of longer itineraries translates off-peak seasons into more
profitable portions of longer cruises. We have bolstered our presence internationally by opening sales offices in Shanghai, Beijing,
Hong Kong, Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo and Mumbai which will further increase sourcing from these markets for all three brands.

In addition to expanding our international sourcing efforts,
we are in the process of deploying our vessels to new destinations around the world. Norwegian Joy homeports year-round in the
Asia Pacific region with itineraries that include many of the region’s ports.

Additionally, all three of our brands sail to the Republic of
Cuba. These sailings began in the spring of 2017, and offer U.S. travelers the opportunity to visit the culturally rich country
on select Caribbean sailings that include calls in the historic city of Havana.

Passenger Ticket Revenue

We offer our guests a wide variety of cruise fare options when
booking a cruise. Our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities,
as well as meals and entertainment. In some instances, cruise ticket prices include round-trip airfare to and from the port of
embarkation, complimentary beverages, unlimited shore excursions, free internet, pre-cruise hotel packages, and on some of the
exotic itineraries pre or post land packages. Prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary, stateroom category selected
and the time of year that the voyage takes place.

Onboard and Other Revenue

All three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional
products and services which are not included in the cruise fare, including casino operations, certain food and beverage, gift shop
purchases, spa services, photo services and other similar items. Food and beverage, casino operations and shore excursions are
generally managed directly by us while retail shops, spa services, art auctions and internet services may be managed through
contracts with third-party concessionaires. These contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage for the gross sales derived
from these concessions. Norwegian’s ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations, meals in certain dining facilities
and many onboard activities such as entertainment, pool-side activities, some internet services and various sports programs. Norwegian
generates additional revenue on our ships from casino operations, food and beverage, shore excursions, gift shop purchases, spa
services, photo services and other similar items. To maximize onboard revenue, Norwegian uses various cross-marketing and promotional
tools which are supported by point-of-sale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these products
and services. Oceania Cruises’ offerings may include air transportation and certain other amenities. Regent’s offerings
typically include air transportation, a pre-cruise hotel night stay (for concierge level and above), premium wines and top shelf
liquors, gratuities and unlimited shore excursions. Both Regent and Oceania Cruises generate additional revenue from casino operations,
gift shop purchases, premium shore excursions and spa services.

Onboard and other revenue accounted for 31%, 30% and 28% of
our consolidated revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Revenue Management Practices

Our revenue management function performs extensive analyses
in order to determine booking history and trends by sailing, stateroom category, travel partner, market segment, itinerary and
distribution channel in order to determine cruise ticket pricing. We concentrate on improving early booking occupancy rates to
drive higher Net Yields. We execute targeted and high-frequency marketing campaigns that communicate a message of a value-packed
cruise offering in both North American and select international markets. To increase the effectiveness of these targeted marketing
programs, we emphasize communication to keep the travel agents engaged and informed and utilize call centers focusing on both inbound
calls and outbound calls to high potential targeted customers. This



marketing strategy assists in maximizing the revenue potential
from each customer contact generated by various marketing campaigns. We believe these strategies and other initiatives executed
by our distribution channels will drive sustainable growth in the number of guests carried and in Net Yields achieved.

Seasonality

Our revenue is seasonal and based on the demand for cruises.
Historically, the seasonality of the North American cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during
the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. This predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in
our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for
regularly scheduled Dry-docks, which we typically schedule during non-peak demand periods.

Competition

Our primary competition includes operators such
as Carnival Corporation & Carnival plc, which owns and operates Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess
Cruises and Seabourn Cruise Line, among others, and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which owns and operates Royal
Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises, among others, as well as other cruise lines such as MSC
Cruises, Crystal Cruises, Silversea Cruises and Viking Ocean Cruises. In addition, we compete with
land-based vacation alternatives, such as hotels and resorts, vacation ownership properties, casinos, and tourist
destinations throughout the world.

Sales of cruises and onboard offerings are subject to consumer
discretionary spending levels and may be influenced by geopolitical events and economic conditions.

Marketing Strategy

Our marketing teams work to enhance brand awareness and increase
levels of understanding and consideration of our products and services among consumers and trade and travel partners with the ultimate
goal of driving sales. We utilize a multi-channel strategy that may include a combination of print, television, radio, website/e-commerce,
direct mail, social media, mobile and e-mail campaigns, partnerships, customer loyalty initiatives, market research, and business-to-business
events.

Building customer loyalty among our past guests is an important
element of our marketing strategy. We believe that attending to the needs and motivations of our past guests creates a cost-effective
means of attracting business, particularly to our new ships and itineraries, because past guests are familiar with our brands,
products and services and often return to cruise with us. We have shared customer databases across our brands to further enhance
our communications with our past guests who receive newsletters and mailings with informative destination and product information
and promotional amenities. Continued investments in our websites is also key to ensuring the optimal pre-cruise planning experience
offering guests the ability to shop, reserve and purchase a breadth of onboard products and services. We have a strong communications
stream that provides customized pre-cruise information to help guests maximize their cruise experience as well as a series of communications
to welcome them home and ultimately engage them in booking another cruise.

Travel agents are crucial to our marketing and distribution
efforts. We provide robust marketing support and enhanced tools for our travel agent partners through a variety of programs. Our
travel partners can benefit from our online travel partner education programs that include a wide variety of courses about our
ships, itineraries and other best-selling practices. Agents can also easily customize a multitude of consumer marketing materials
for their use in promoting our products through our online platform.

Guest feedback is also a critically important element in the
development of our overall marketing and business strategies. We regularly initiate guest feedback studies among both travel partners
and consumers to assess the impact of various programs and/or to solicit information that helps shape future direction.

Ship Operations and Cruise Infrastructure

Ship Maintenance and Logistics

Sophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems
support the technical superiority and modern look of our fleet. In addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an
ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements, each of our ships is generally taken out of service, approximately
every 24 to 60 months, for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work, repairs and improvements performed in
Dry-dock. Dry-dock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under IMO requirements reflected in chapters of the International
Convention of the Safety of Life at Seas (“SOLAS”) and to some extent the International Load Lines Convention. Under
these regulations, it is required that a passenger ship Dry-dock once in five years (depending on age of vessel), twice in 5 years
(depending on flag state and age of vessel) and the maximum interval between each Dry-dock cannot exceed 3 years (depending age
of vessel and flag state). However, most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the Bahamas and/or
Marshall Islands (flag state), as applicable, after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to Dry-dock
once every 5 years. To the extent practical, each ship’s crew, catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the Dry-dock
period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work. Accordingly, Dry-dock work is typically performed during non-peak
demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service. Dry-docks are typically
scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability.

Suppliers



Our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and
acquisition. Our largest operating expenditures are for payroll and related (including our contract with a third party who provides
certain crew services), fuel, food and beverage, advertising and marketing and travel agent services. Most of the supplies that
we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices. In addition, owing to the large quantities that we purchase,
we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies. Our purchases are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. Payment terms
granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry.

Crew and Staff

Best-in-class guest service levels are paramount in the markets
in which we operate, where travelers have discriminating tastes and high expectations for service quality. We have dedicated increasing
attention and resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests. Among other initiatives,
we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs, with a focus on career development. We believe that our dedication to anticipating
and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew,
helping to build customer loyalty.

We place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and
crew. We operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of SOLAS and International Management Code for the Safe
Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (“ISM Code”), the international safety standards which govern the cruise
industry. Every crew member is well trained in the Company’s stringent safety protocols, participating in regular safety
trainings, exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships.

Our captains are experienced seafarers. We further ensure that
our captains regularly undergo rigorous training on navigation and bridge operations. To assist our captains and officers while
at sea, we have extensive navigation protocols in place. Our bridge operations are based on robust navigational procedures and
risk analysis. Our bridge teams follow pre-set voyage plans which are thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge
team prior to port departures and arrivals. In addition, all of our ships employ the latest state-of-the-art navigational equipment
and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have the most accurate data regarding the planned itinerary.

Prior to every cruise setting sail or upon departure, we hold
a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated. We also show an
extensive safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions. Our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control
and fire prevention and control systems. In recent years, our ships have continuously been upgraded and include internal and external
regulatory audits.

We have developed Safety Management Systems (“SMS”),
which establish policies, procedures, training, qualification, quality, compliance, audit and self-improvement standards for all
employees, both shipboard and shoreside. SMS also provides real-time reports and information to support the fleet and risk management
decisions. Through these systems, our senior managers, as well as ship management, can focus on consistent, high quality operation
of the fleet. Our SMS are approved and audited regularly by our classification society, Lloyds Register, and they also undergo
regular internal audits as well as annual/semiannual inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard, flag state and other port and state authorities.
We screen and train our crew to ensure crew familiarity and proficiency with the safety equipment onboard. Various safety measures
have been implemented on all of our ships and additional personnel have been appointed in our ship operations departments.

Insurance

We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships,
which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship. The coverage for each of the hull and machinery
policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the European and U.S. insurance markets.

In addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery
of our ships, we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels
to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business. The insurance we carry includes:

·

Protection and indemnity insurance (coverage for passenger, crew and third-party liabilities), including insurance against risk of pollution liabilities;

·

War risk insurance, including
terrorist risk insurance. The terms of our war risk policies include provisions where underwriters can give seven days’
notice to the insured that the policies will be cancelled in the event of a change of risk which is typical for policies in the
marine industry. Upon any proposed cancellation the insurer shall, before expiry of the seven day period, submit new terms; and

·

Insurance for our shoreside
property and general liability risks.

We believe that all of our insurance coverage, including those
noted above, is subject to market-standard limitations, exclusions and deductible levels.

The Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers
and Their Luggage by Sea (1974) (the “Athens Convention”) and the Protocol to the Athens Convention Relating to the
Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea (1976) (the “1976 Protocol”) are generally applicable to passenger
ships. The U.S. has not ratified the Athens Convention; however, with limited exceptions, the 1976 Protocol may be contractually
enforced with respect to cruises that do not call at a U.S. port. The IMO Diplomatic Conference agreed



to a new protocol to the Athens Convention on November 1,
2002 (the “2002 Protocol”). The 2002 Protocol, which took effect on April 23, 2014, establishes for the first
time a level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators with a right of direct action against
the insurer. In addition, on December 31, 2012, the European Union (“EU”) Passenger Liability Regulation became
effective and requires us to carry a minimum level of financial responsibility per passenger per incident. We believe the amount
of our protection and indemnity policy coverage provides the compulsory insurance; however, no assurance can be given that affordable
and secure insurance markets will remain available to provide the level and type of coverage required.

Trademarks and Tradenames

Under the Norwegian brand, we own a number of registered trademarks
relating to, among other things, the names “NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE” and “FEEL FREE,” the names of our ships
(except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending), incentive programs and specialty services rendered
on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “THE HAVEN BY NORWEGIAN.” In addition, we own registered trademarks
relating to the “FREESTYLE” family of names, including, “FREESTYLE CRUISING,” “FREESTYLE DINING”
and “FREESTYLE VACATION.” We believe that these trademarks are widely recognized throughout North America, Europe and
other areas of the world and have considerable value.

Under the Oceania Cruises brand, we own a number of registered
trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “OCEANIA CRUISES” and its logo, “REGATTA,” “INSIGNIA,”
and “YOUR WORLD. YOUR WAY.”

Under the Regent brand, we own registered trademarks relating
to, among other things, the names “SEVEN SEAS CRUISES” and “LUXURY GOES EXPLORING” as well as the names
of our ships (except where trademark applications have been filed and are pending).

We also claim common law rights in trademarks and tradenames
used in conjunction with our ships, incentive programs, customer loyalty program and specialty services rendered onboard our ships
for each of our brands.

The Regent ships have been operating under the Regent brand
since 2006. We entered into a trademark license agreement with Regent Hospitality Worldwide, Inc., which we amended in February 2011,
granting us the right to use the “Regent” brand family of marks. The amended trademark license agreement allows Regent
to use the Regent tradename, in conjunction with cruises, in perpetuity, subject to the terms and conditions in the agreement.

Regulatory Issues

Registration of Our Ships

Seventeen of the ships that we currently operate are registered
in the Bahamas. One of our ships, Pride of America, is a U.S.-flagged ship. Seven of our ships are registered in the Marshall Islands.
Our ships registered in the Bahamas and the Marshall Islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to Bahamian and Marshall
Islands requirements and are subject to International laws and regulations and to various U.S. federal regulatory agencies, including,
but not limited to, the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. Our U.S.-registered ship is subject to laws and regulations
of the U.S. federal government, including, but not limited to, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Coast
Guard and U.S. Department of Labor. The international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and other legal requirements
applicable to our operations change regularly, depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited.

Our ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities
in the various countries that they visit. Such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety, security,
environmental, customs, immigration, health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements.

Environmental Protection

Our ships are subject to various international, national, state
and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those that govern air emissions, waste discharge,
water management and disposal, and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals, solvents and paints. Under such
laws and regulations, we are prohibited from discharging certain materials, such as petrochemicals and plastics, into waterways,
and we must adhere to various air quality-related requirements.

With regard to air quality requirements, the International Maritime
Organization’s (“IMO”) convention entitled Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”) has set
a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 0.5% (reduced from the current 3.5% global limit) beginning January 2020. Alternative
compliance methods, such as the use of alternative fuels, or sulfur scrubbers that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur emissions,
may also be utilized. This fuel standard was initially set in 2008 and was reviewed in 2016 to determine the availability of fuel
oil to comply with this standard. The review took into account supply and demand in the global fuel oil market, an analysis of
trends in fuel oil markets and other relevant issues. The result of the review was to confirm the date of implementation as January
2020.

MARPOL also requires stricter limitations on sulfur emissions
within designated Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”), which include the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, North
American waters and the U.S. Caribbean Sea. Ships operating in these waters are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no
more than 0.1% or use approved alternative emission reduction methods. Additional ECAs may also be established in the future, with
areas around Norway, Japan, and the Mediterranean Sea being considered.



Ballast water discharges are governed by the MARPOL Ballast
Water Management Convention, which came into force in 2017 (“The Convention”), and which governs the discharge of ballast
water from ships. Ballast water, which is seawater held onboard ships and used for stabilization, may contain a variety of marine
species. The Convention is designed to regulate the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species
to new, different, or potentially unsuitable environments.

MARPOL also sets forth requirements for discharges of garbage,
oil and sewage from ships, including regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of such discharges,
and the provision of port reception facilities for sewage handling. Ships are generally prohibited from discharging sewage into
the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land. Governments are required to ensure the provision of adequate reception
facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage, without causing delay to ships. Ships are generally required to
be equipped with either approved sewage treatment plants, disinfecting systems or sewage holding tanks.

Recently adopted amendments to MARPOL will make the Baltic Sea
a “Special Area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be prohibited. Stricter discharge restrictions will
be in effect for new passenger ships in 2019, and for existing passenger ships starting in 2021.

These requirements may impact our operations unless suitable
port waste facilities are available, or new technologies for onboard waste treatment are developed. Accordingly, the cost of complying
with these requirements is not determinable at this time.

In the U.S., the Clean Water Act of 1972, and other laws and
regulations, provide the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’
incidental discharges of ballast water, bilge water, gray water, anti-fouling paints and other substances during normal operations
while a vessel is in inland waters, within three nautical miles of land, and in designated federally-protected waters. The U.S.
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) program, authorized by the Clean Water Act, was established
to reduce pollution within U.S. territorial waters. For our affected ships, all of the NPDES requirements are set forth in the
EPA’s Vessel General Permit (“VGP”). The VGP establishes effluent limits for 26 specific discharge streams incidental
to the normal operation of a vessel. In addition to these discharge- and vessel-specific requirements, the VGP includes requirements
for inspections, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping.

The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, which implements the
MARPOL in the U.S., provides for potentially severe civil and criminal penalties related to ship-generated pollution for incidents
in U.S. waters within three nautical miles of land and, in some cases, within the 200-nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”).

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) provides
for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200-nautical mile EEZ of the U.S., subject to defined
monetary limits. OPA 90 requires that in order for us to operate in U.S. waters, we must have Certificates of Financial Responsibility
(“COFR”) from the U.S. Coast Guard for each ship.  Our continued OPA 90 certification signifies our ability to
meet the requirements for related OPA 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance.

Many coastal U.S. states have also enacted environmental regulations
that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance.
These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law and, in some cases, the laws have no statutory limits of liability. Among
the most stringent requirements are those set by the State of Alaska, which has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges
in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards.
The legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in Alaskan waters.

The European Union (“EU”) has also adopted a substantial
and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at maintaining or improving the quality of the environment. To support the implementation
and enforcement of European environmental legislation, the EU has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement
as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections.

With regard to air emissions from seagoing ships, the EU requires
the use of low sulfur (less than 0.1%) marine gas oil in EU ports. Passenger ships on regular service to EU ports (and not operating
in an ECA) are required to use fuels containing a maximum sulfur content of 1.5%. The EU has set January 2020 as the compliance
date for the 0.5% fuel sulfur limit within their jurisdictional waters.

In addition to the existing legal requirements, we are committed
to helping to preserve the environment, because a clean, unspoiled environment is a key element that attracts guests to our ships.
Furthermore, NCL (Bahamas) Ltd. and NCL (America) LLC are certified under the International Organization for Standardization’s
14001 Standard. This voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental
management system which we have adopted for our operations. Currently we operate under an Environmental Management System that
is incorporated into the Company’s SMS.

If we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws, regulations
or treaties, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other
expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws, regulations and treaties. Any fines or other sanctions for violation or
failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operations,



cash flow or financial condition.

Permits for Glacier Bay, Alaska

In connection with certain Alaska cruise operations, we rely
on concession permits from the U.S. National Park Service to operate our ships in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. We currently
hold a concession permit allowing for 22 calls per summer cruising season through September 30, 2019. However, there can be
no assurance that such permit will be renewed when necessary or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permit will remain
unchanged in the future.

Passenger Well-Being

In the U.S., we must meet the U.S. Public Health
Service’s requirements, which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the Vessel Sanitation Program of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We rate
at the top of the range of CDC and FDA scores achieved by the major cruise lines. In addition, the cruise industry and the
U.S. Public Health Service have agreed on regulations for food, water and hygiene, aimed at proactively protecting the health
of travelers and preventing illness transmission to U.S. ports.

Security and Safety

The IMO has adopted safety standards as part of the SOLAS convention,
which apply to all of our ships. SOLAS establishes requirements for vessel design, structural features, construction methods and
materials, refurbishment standards, life-saving equipment, fire protection and detection, safe management and operation and security
in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew. All of our crew undergo regular security and safety training
exercises that meet all international and national maritime regulations.

SOLAS requires that all cruise ships are certified as having
safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for
Pollution Prevention (“ISM Code”). All of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ISM Code. Each such certificate
is granted for a five-year period and is subject to periodic verification.

The SOLAS requirements are amended and extended by the IMO from
time to time. For example, the International Port and Ship Facility Code (“ISPS Code”) was adopted by the IMO in December
2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments, port authorities and shipping
companies.

Amendments to SOLAS required that ships constructed in accordance
with pre-1974 SOLAS requirements install automatic sprinkler systems. IMO adopted an amendment to SOLAS which requires partial
bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of non-combustible construction. The SOLAS regulation implemented Long-Range Identification
and Tracking. All of our ships are in compliance with the requirements of SOLAS as amended and/or as applicable to the keel-laying
date.

In addition to the requirements of the ISPS Code, the U.S. Congress
enacted the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) which implements a number of security measures at
ports in the U.S. including measures that apply to ships registered outside the U.S. while docking at ports in the U.S. The U.S.
Coast Guard has published MTSA regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the U.S.,
provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification
of crew members on such ships. The Transportation Workers Identification Credential is a U.S. requirement for accessibility into
and onto U.S. ports and U.S.-flagged ships.

Maritime-Labor

In 2006, the International Labor Organization (“ILO”),
an agency of the United Nations that develops and oversees international labor standards, adopted a new Consolidated Maritime Labor
Convention (“MLC 2006”). MLC 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already
found in 68 maritime labor Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO since 1920. MLC 2006 includes a broad range of requirements,
such as a broader definition of a seafarer, minimum age of seafarers, medical certificates, recruitment practices, training, repatriation,
food, recreational facilities, health and welfare, hours of work and rest, accommodations, wages and entitlements. MLC 2006 added
requirements not previously in effect, in the areas of occupational safety and health. MLC 2006 became effective in certain countries
commencing August 2013. The Standard of Training Certification and Watch Keeping for Seafarers (“STCW”), as amended,
establishes minimum standards relating to training, certification and watch-keeping for our seafarers.

Financial Requirements

The Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”) requires
evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of U.S. ports to indemnify
passengers in the event of non-performance of the transportation. Accordingly, each of our three brands are required to maintain
a $30.0 million third-party performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations
to passengers. The guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price index-based adjustments. Also, our brands have
a legal requirement to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the U.K. As of December 31, 2017,
approximately British Pound Sterling 11.8 million was in place as a security guarantee. We also are required to establish financial
responsibility by other jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of non-performance of our obligations to passengers from those
jurisdictions.

From time to time, various other regulatory and legislative
changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an



effect on our operations in the U.S. and the cruise industry
in general.

For information regarding risks associated with our compliance
with legal and regulatory requirements, see Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk
factor titled “We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, which could
adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased
revenue.”

Taxation

U.S. Income Taxation

The following discussion is based upon current provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions, all
of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to
vary substantially from the consequences described below.

Exemption of International Shipping Income under Section
883 of the Code

Under Section 883 of the Code (“Section 883”) and
the related regulations, a foreign corporation will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation on its U.S.-source income derived
from the international operation of ships (“shipping income”) if: (a) it is organized in a qualified foreign country,
which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the U.S. in respect of each
category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883; and (b) either: (1) more than 50% of the value
of its stock is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified shareholders, which includes individuals who are “residents”
of a qualified foreign country; (2) one or more classes of its stock representing, in the aggregate, more than 50% of the combined
voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities
markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the U.S. (the “publicly traded test”); or (3) it is a “controlled
foreign corporation” (a “CFC”) for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50% of its stock is owned
by qualified U.S. persons for more than half of the taxable year (the “CFC test”). In addition, U.S. Treasury Regulations
require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting
requirements.

NCLH is incorporated in Bermuda, a qualified foreign country
which grants an equivalent exemption, and NCLH meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares were primarily and regularly
traded on the Nasdaq until December 18, 2017 and have been primarily and regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
since December 19, 2017. Both the Nasdaq and the NYSE are considered to be established securities markets in the U.S. Therefore,
we believe that NCLH qualifies for the benefits of Section 883.

We believe and have taken the position that substantially all
of NCLH’s income, including the income of its ship-owning subsidiaries, is properly categorized as shipping income, and that
we do not have a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that the IRS interpretation of shipping income
could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify (or will not qualify) as shipping income.
Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under Section 883.
There are factual circumstances beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH’s ordinary
shares, which could cause NCLH or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under Section 883. Further, any changes
in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income, and we can give no assurances on this
matter.

Under certain circumstances, changes in the identity, residence
or holdings of NCLH’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause NCLH’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded
on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under Section 883. Therefore, as a precautionary matter,
NCLH has provided protections in its bye-laws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly traded
test by prohibiting any person, other than the Sponsors, from owning, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 4.9% of
NCLH’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by NCLH’s Board of Directors (the “4.9% limit”).
Any outstanding shares held in excess of the 4.9% limit will be transferred to and held in a trust.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, Regent and its non-U.S.
subsidiaries are disregarded as entities separate from their immediate foreign parent (PCH) and Oceania Cruises is treated as a
corporation. For 2015, 2016 and 2017 both Regent and Oceania Cruises relied on NCLH’s ability to meet the requirements necessary
to qualify for the benefits of Section 883 as discussed above.

Taxation of International Shipping Income Where Section 883
of the Code is Inapplicable

Unless exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, a foreign corporation
is subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the U.S.
If we fail to qualify for the exemption under Section 883 in respect of our U.S.-sourced shipping income, or if the provision was
repealed, then we will be subject to taxation in the U.S. on such income.

Generally, “shipping income” is any income that
is derived from the use of vessels, from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time, voyage or Bareboat Charter basis or
from the performance of services directly related to those uses. For these purposes, shipping income attributable to transportation
that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the U.S., which we refer to as “U.S.- source shipping income,”
will be considered to be 50% derived from sources within the U.S.



If we do not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if
the provision was repealed, then any U.S.-sourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected
income would be subject to federal corporate income taxation on a net basis (generally at a 35% rate, 21% rate effective January
1, 2018) and state and local taxes, and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch
profits tax of 30%, unless a lower treaty rate applies (the “Net Tax Regime”). Our U.S. source shipping income is considered
effectively connected income if we have, or are considered to have, a fixed place of business in the U.S. involved in the earning
of U.S. source shipping income, and substantially all of our U.S. source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled
transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals
between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the U.S.

If we do not have a fixed place of business in the U.S. or substantially
all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation, the income will generally not be considered to be effectively
connected income. In that case, we would be subject to a special 4% tax on our U.S. source shipping income (the “4% Tax Regime”).

Other United States Taxation

U.S. Treasury Regulations list several items of income which
are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and, to the extent derived from U.S. sources, are subject
to U.S. federal income taxes under the Net Tax Regime discussed above. Income items considered non-incidental to the international
operation of ships include income from the sale of single-day cruises, shore excursions, air and other transportation, and pre-
and post-cruise land packages. We believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation
of ships is shipping income.

Income from U.S.-flagged Operation under the NCL America

Income derived from our U.S.-flagged operation generally will
be subject to U.S. corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels.  We expect that such income will not be subject
to U.S. branch profits tax nor a U.S. dividend withholding tax under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty.

U.K. Income Taxation

As a result of a restructuring, NCLH and NCLC became tax residents
of the U.K. and are subject to normal U.K. corporation tax.

U.S. Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels

Gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt
from tax under Section 883 provided NCLH qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 in respect of our shipping income.
If, however, our gain does not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if the provision was repealed, then such gain could
be subject to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Tax Regime.

Certain State, Local and Non-U.S. Tax Matters

We may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income
taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file
tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal
income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property, or operations
involving foreign property may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.

Changes in Tax Laws

The various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result
in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. For example, legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from
U.S. federal income tax under Section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the U.S. Moreover,
we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or
future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty on income
derived in respect of our U.S.-flagged operation.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted
on December 22, 2017. Among other provisions, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The SEC staff
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 118, which addresses how a company recognizes provisional amounts when
a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail
to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes in the Act. The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared
and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year. As of December 31, 2017,
we have not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, as described below, we have made a reasonable
estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances. These amounts are provisional and subject to change. The most significant
impact of the Act for the Company was a $7.4 million reduction of the value of net deferred tax liabilities (which represent future
tax expenses) that was recorded as a discrete tax benefit as a result of lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to
21%. The tax benefit represents a provisional amount and the Company’s current best estimate. Any adjustments recorded to
the provisional amount through the end of 2018 will be included in income from operations as an adjustment to tax expense. The
provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Company’s current



interpretation of the Act and may change as the Company receives
additional clarification and implementation guidance. Other aspects of the Act are either not applicable or not expected to have
a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 3,000
full-time employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 28,000 shipboard employees. Regent and Oceania Cruises’
ships also utilize a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant employees onboard. We refer you to “Risk Factors—Amendments
to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely
affect our financial results” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining
agreements that are currently in place.

Ports and Facilities

We own a private island in the Bahamas, Great Stirrup Cay, which
we utilize as a port-of-call on certain itineraries. We have also developed a cruise destination in Belize, Harvest Caye, which
we introduced in November 2016. In addition, we have entered into various agreements relating to port or berthing rights for our
ships, which include the following:

·

an agreement with the Government of Bermuda whereby we are permitted weekly calls in Bermuda through 2022 from Boston and New York.

·

contracts with the Port of New Orleans, PortMiami, Port Canaveral and the Port of Tampa pursuant to which we receive preferential Berths to the exclusion of other vessels for certain specified days of the week at the cities’ cruise ship terminals.

·

a concession permit with the U.S. National Park Service whereby our ships are permitted to call on Glacier Bay during each summer cruise season through September 30, 2019.

·

an agreement with the British Virgin Islands Port Authority granting priority berthing rights for a 15-year term through April 2032 with options to extend the agreement for two additional five year terms.

·

an agreement with the West Indian Company Limited granting priority berthing rights in St. Thomas for a 10-year term through September 2026 with an option to extend the agreement for an additional five years.

·

an agreement with the Port of Seattle for a 15-year lease through October 2030 with an option to extend the agreement for an additional five years where we have committed to a capital investment to develop the port for approximately $30 million and the port has committed to reimburse $15 million.

Segment Reporting

We have concluded that our business has a single reportable
segment. Each brand, Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available
and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment. Our operating
segments have similar economic and qualitative characteristics, including similar long-term margins and similar products and services;
therefore, we aggregate all of the operating segments into one reportable segment.

Although we sell cruises on an international basis, our passenger
ticket revenue is primarily attributed to U.S.-sourced guests who make reservations in the U.S. Revenue attributable to U.S.-sourced
guests was 77%, 81% and 75% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No other individual country’s
revenues exceeded 10% in any of our last three years.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information contained in this annual
report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business. If any of the risks discussed
in this annual report actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In connection with the forward-looking statements
that appear in this annual report, you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “Cautionary
Statement Concerning Forward–Looking Statements.”



Risks Related to the Company

Terrorist acts, armed conflict and threats thereof, acts
of piracy, and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises.

The threat or possibility of future terrorist acts, an outbreak
of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility or fear of such events, political unrest and instability, the issuance
of travel advisories or elevated national threat warnings by national governments, an increase in the activity of pirates, and
other geo-political uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises,
and consequently, the pricing for cruises. Decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely
affect our business by reducing our profitability.

Adverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss
caused by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters, including, but not limited to, oil spills and other environmental
mishaps, extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods and typhoons, fire, mechanical failure, collisions, human error,
war, terrorism, piracy, political action, civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events.
Any such event may result in loss of life or property, loss of revenue or increased costs. The operation of cruise ships also involves
the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port, including missing guests, inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard
crimes, which may bring into question passenger safety, may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation
against us. Although we place passenger safety as the highest priority in the design and operation of our fleet, we have experienced
accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the
future. It is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased
port-related and other costs resulting from such adverse events. Any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise
ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight.
An adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about
us. Anything that damages our reputation (whether or not justified), including adverse publicity about passenger safety, could
have an adverse impact on demand, which could lead to price discounting and a reduction in our sales and could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations. If there is a significant accident, mechanical failure or similar
problem involving a ship, we may have to place a ship in an extended Dry-dock period for repairs. This could result in material
lost revenue and/or expenditures.

The adverse impact of general economic and related factors,
such as fluctuating or increasing levels of unemployment, underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices, declines in the securities
and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer
confidence. The demand for cruises is affected by international, national and local economic conditions.

The demand for cruises is affected by international, national
and local economic conditions. Adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in North America or globally, such as
the volatility of fuel prices, higher interest rates, stock and real estate market declines and/or volatility, more restrictive
credit markets, higher unemployment or underemployment rates, higher taxes and changes in governmental policies could reduce the
level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests. Consequently, this may negatively
affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries, which are a discretionary purchase. Decreases in demand for cruise vacations
could result in price discounting, which, in turn, could reduce the profitability of our business. In addition, these conditions
could also impact our suppliers, which could result in disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us.

Epidemics and viral outbreaks could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Public perception about the safety of travel and adverse publicity
related to passenger or crew illness, such as incidents of viral illnesses, stomach flu or other contagious diseases, may impact
demand for cruises and result in cruise cancellations and employee absenteeism. If any wide-ranging health scare should occur,
our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.

Our expansion into and investments in new markets may
not be successful.

We believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our
passenger sourcing into major markets, such as Europe and Australia, as well as into emerging markets in the Asia Pacific region
and to expand our itineraries in new markets, such as Cuba, and we are in the process of such expansion efforts. Expansion into
new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management. There can be no assurance that these markets
will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment
spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets, which could adversely impact
our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Conducting business internationally may result in increased
costs and risks.

We operate our business internationally and plan to continue
to develop our international presence. Operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks, including political risks, risks
of increases in duties and taxes, risks relating to anti-bribery laws, as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising,
vacation or maritime businesses, or governing the operations of foreign-based companies may change. Additional risks include imposition
of trade barriers, withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and changes in and application
of foreign taxation structures, including value added taxes. If we are unable to address these risks adequately, our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Operating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes
conflicting legal and regulatory requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in
the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. We have implemented safeguards and policies
to prevent violations of various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments
and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards
and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct
prohibited by our policies, but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible. If our employees or agents violate our policies,
if we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we
fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil
sanctions and penalties.

We have operations in and source passengers from the United
Kingdom and other member countries of the European Union. On June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum
to withdraw from the European Union. The proposed withdrawal resulted in increased volatility in the global financial markets and
caused severe fluctuations in global currency exchange rates. The proposed withdrawal could potentially adversely affect tax, legal
and regulatory regimes to which our business in the region is subject. The withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes,
disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Further, uncertainty
around these issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the United Kingdom and the other economies in which we operate
making it more difficult to source passengers from these regions. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Breaches in data security or other disturbances to our
information technology and other networks could impair our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

The integrity and reliability of our information technology
systems and other networks are crucial to our business operations. Disruptions to these networks could impair our operations and
have an adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand. In addition, certain
networks are dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted
availability. Among other things, actual or threatened natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires, floods)
or similar events, information systems failures, computer viruses, denial of service attacks and other cyber-attacks may cause
disruptions to our information technology, telecommunications and other networks. While we have and continue to invest in business
continuity, disaster recovery, data restoration plans and data and information technology security, we cannot completely insulate
ourselves from disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results. We carry limited business
interruption insurance for certain shoreside operations, subject to limitations, exclusions and deductibles.

We have also made significant investments in our information
technology systems to optimize booking procedures, enhance the marketing power of our websites and control costs. Any unauthorized
use of our information systems to gain access to sensitive information, corrupt data or create general disturbances in our operations
systems could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation. If our security systems were breached, we could
be exposed to cyber-related risks and malware, and credit card and other sensitive data could be at risk. For example, in the processing
of our guest transactions and as part of our ordinary business operations, we and certain of our third-party service providers
collect, process, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information, including email addresses and home
addresses and financial data such as credit card information. The security of the systems and network where we and our service
providers store this data is a critical element of our business, and these systems and our network may be vulnerable to computer
viruses, hackers and other security issues. We cannot assure you that the precautions we have taken to avoid an unauthorized incursion
of our information systems are either adequate or implemented properly to prevent a data breach and its adverse financial and reputational
consequences to our business. In addition, we may not be in a position to promptly address attacks or unauthorized access or to
implement adequate preventative measures if we are unable to immediately detect such attacks. We are also subject to laws relating
to privacy of personal data, including European Union data privacy regulations. The compromise of our information systems resulting
in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to the personally identifiable information of our guests, prospective guests
or employees could result in governmental investigation, civil liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy
of personal information, any or all of which could disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect our business. Additionally,
any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry security requirements
or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment.



In the event of a data security breach of our systems and/or
third-party systems or a denial of service attack, we may incur costs associated with the following: response, notification, forensics,
regulatory investigations, public relations, consultants, credit identity monitoring, credit freezes, fraud alert, credit identity
restoration, credit card cancellation, credit card reissuance or replacement, data restoration, regulatory fines and penalties,
vendor fines and penalties, legal fees, damages and settlements. In addition, data security breaches or denial of service attacks
may cause business interruption, information technology disruption, disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation, digital
asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data, damage to our reputation, damages to intangible property and other intangible
damages, such as loss of consumer confidence, all of which could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial
results.

Changes in fuel prices and/or other cruise operating costs
would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increased costs related
to fuel prices.

Fuel expense is a significant cost for our Company. Future increases
in the cost of fuel globally or regulatory requirements which require us to use more expensive types of fuel would increase the
cost of our cruise ship operations. In addition, we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces
and economic or political instability beyond our control. Despite any fuel hedges we are currently a party to, or may enter into
in the future, increases in fuel prices or other cruise operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations if we are unable to recover these increased costs through price increases charged to our guests.
Our hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs, and any price protection provided may be limited due
to market conditions, including choice of hedging instruments, breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price
of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties. To the extent that we use hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation
to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly, such hedge contracts may limit our ability to benefit fully from lower
fuel costs in the future. There can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will be cost-effective, will provide any particular
level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedging arrangements.
Additionally, deterioration in our financial condition could negatively affect our ability to enter into new hedge contracts in
the future.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could
adversely affect our financial results.

We earn revenues, pay expenses, purchase and own assets and
incur liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar; most significantly a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated
in foreign currencies, particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, euro and Australian dollar. Because our consolidated financial
statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S.
dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against
our other major currencies may adversely affect our U.S. dollar financial results and will reduce the U.S. dollar amount received
upon conversion of these currencies into U.S. dollars.

We have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction
contracts denominated in euros or other foreign currencies. While we have entered into foreign currency derivatives to manage a
portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts, we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions
of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged. Additionally, if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related
ship construction contract, any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated.

Overcapacity in key markets or globally could adversely
affect our operating results.

We continue to expand our fleet through our newbuild program
and may add up to nine additional ships to our fleet through 2027. Our competitors have also announced similar expansions to their
fleets. These increases in capacity in the cruise industry globally and potential overcapacity in certain key markets may cause
us to lower pricing, which would reduce profitability and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, older ships
in our fleet may not be as competitive as new ships enter the market and we may not be able to sell such older ships at optimal
prices.

Unavailability of ports of call may materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason
why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation. The availability of ports, including the specific port
facility at which our guests will embark and disembark, is affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, existing
capacity constraints, security, safety and environmental concerns, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes,
floods, typhoons and earthquakes, financial limitations on port development, political instability, exclusivity arrangements that
ports may have with our competitors, local governmental regulations and fees, local community concerns about port development and
other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists and sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign
Assets Control of the United States Treasury Department or other regulatory bodies. Any limitations on the availability of ports
of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.



Our indebtedness, and the agreements governing our indebtedness,
may limit our flexibility in operating our business.

The agreements governing our indebtedness contain, and any instruments
governing future indebtedness of ours may contain, covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us,
including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to, among other things:

·

incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preference shares;

·

pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital or make other restricted payments, including the ability
of NCLH’s subsidiaries, including NCLC, to pay dividends or make distributions to NCLH;

·

repurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness;

·

make certain investments or acquisitions;

·

transfer, sell or create liens on certain assets;

·

consolidate or merge with, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to, other companies;

·

enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;

·

pledge the capital stock of any guarantors of our indebtedness; and

·

designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.

As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner
in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations
or capital needs. In addition, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness,
which may limit our available funds for other business functions and strategic opportunities and may make us more vulnerable to
downturns in our business, the economy and the industry in which we operate. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to
service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, including
refinancing our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may
require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.

We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as
collateral under our existing debt agreements. If any of the holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness,
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness.

Under our existing debt agreements, we are required to satisfy
and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control,
and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios. A failure to comply with the covenants contained in our existing
debt agreements could result in an event of default under such agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of any default under our existing debt
agreements, the holders of our indebtedness thereunder:

·

will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us, if applicable;

·

could elect to declare all indebtedness outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable
and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, if applicable; and/or

·

could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay such indebtedness.

Such actions by the holders of our indebtedness could cause
cross defaults under our other indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the holders of our secured indebtedness
could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the indebtedness under our existing debt agreements
were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.

The impact of volatility and disruptions in the global
credit and financial markets may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks, including
those under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees.



There can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow additional
money on terms as favorable as our current debt, on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Economic downturns, including failures
of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis, can disrupt the capital and credit markets. Such disruptions could
cause counterparties under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress
payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them,
which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts
that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements. Also, we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts
due to our counterparties under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements. If we were
to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments, we would likely incur
significant costs to replace the counterparty. Any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in
additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument.

Our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel
or the loss of key personnel may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our success is dependent upon our personnel and our ability
to recruit and retain high quality employees. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees in
order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth.  We need to hire and train a considerable number
of qualified crew members to staff the ships that will be joining our fleet in the coming years. This may require significant efforts
on the part of our management team, and our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified crew members would adversely affect
our business.

Our executive officers and other members of senior management
have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. The
unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us.

Delays in our shipbuilding program and ship repairs, maintenance
and refurbishments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The new construction, refurbishment, repair and maintenance
of our ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction,
refurbishment and repair projects. Our ships are subject to the risk of mechanical failure or accident, which we have occasionally
experienced and have had to repair. If there is a mechanical failure or accident in the future, we may be unable to procure spare
parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense or suspension of service, especially if a problem affects
certain specialized maritime equipment, such as the radar, a pod propulsion unit, the electrical/power management system, the steering
gear or the gyro system.

In addition, availability, work stoppages, insolvency or financial
problems in the shipyards’ construction, refurbishment or repair of our ships, or other “force majeure” events
that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors, could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery,
refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships. Any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result
in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us, potential claims and impairment of losses. A significant
delay in the delivery of a new ship, or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have
an adverse effect on our business. The consolidation of the control of certain European cruise shipyards could result in higher
prices for the construction of new ships and refurbishments and could limit the availability of qualified shipyards to construct
new ships. Also, the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships
on a timely basis. These potential events and the associated losses, to the extent that they are not adequately covered by contractual
remedies or insurance, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We rely on third parties to provide hotel management services
for certain ships and certain other services, and we are exposed to risks facing such providers. In certain circumstances, we may
not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us.

We rely on external third parties to provide hotel management
services for certain ships and certain other services that are vital to our business. If these service providers suffer financial
hardship or are otherwise unable to continue providing such services, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such
service providers in a timely manner, which may cause an interruption in our operations. To the extent that we are able to replace
such service providers, we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services. Both the interruption of operations
and the replacement of the third-party service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and
results of operations.

We rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger
and crew connections. Increases in the price of, or major changes or reduction in, commercial airline services could undermine
our customer base or disrupt our operations.

A number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial
airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises. Increases in the price of airfare due to increases
in fuel prices, fuel surcharges, changes in commercial airline services as a result of strikes, weather or other events, or the
lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could



adversely affect our ability to deliver guests and crew to or
from our ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which would, in turn, have an adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

Amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for
crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results.

Currently, we are a party to eight collective bargaining agreements.
Four of these agreements are in effect through 2018 and four through 2020. Any future amendments to such collective bargaining
agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on
our financial condition. In addition, although our collective bargaining agreements have a no-strike provision, they may not prevent
a disruption in work on our ships in the future. Any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial
results.

Our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

There can be no assurance that all of our risks are fully insured
against or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance. Such losses, to the extent they are not adequately covered
by contractual remedies or insurance, could affect our financial results. In addition, we have been and continue to be subject
to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on our own claim records, but also the claim records of all other members of the
protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability. Our payment of these calls
and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us. If we were to sustain significant losses in the future, our
ability to obtain insurance coverage at all or at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected. Moreover,
irrespective of the occurrence of such events, there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance
coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all.

We rely on external distribution channels for passenger
bookings, and major changes in the availability of external distribution channels could undermine our customer base.

The majority of our guests book their cruises through independent
travel agents, wholesalers and tour operators. In the event that these distribution channels are adversely impacted by an economic
downturn, or by other factors, this could reduce the distribution channels available for us to market and sell our cruises and
we could be forced to increase the use of alternative distribution channels we are not accustomed to. If this were to occur, it
could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, independent travel agents, wholesalers and tour
operators generally sell and market our cruises on a non-exclusive basis. Although we offer commissions and other incentives to
them for booking our cruises, there can be no guarantee that our competitors will not offer higher commissions and incentives in
the future. Travel agents may face increasing pressure from our competitors, particularly in the North American market, to sell
and market our competitors’ cruises exclusively. If such exclusive arrangements were introduced, there can be no assurances
that we will be able to find alternative distribution channels to ensure that our customer base would not be affected.

Litigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could
adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation.

Our business is subject to various U.S. and international laws
and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims
and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and/or lead to litigation or
legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. In certain circumstances,
it may not be economical to defend against such matters, and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter.
Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

As a result of any ship-related or other incidents, litigation
claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations, including, but not limited to, those arising from personal
injury, loss of life, loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected
coastal waters and the surrounding area, may be asserted or brought against various parties, including us and/or our cruise brands.
The time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims, actions and investigations. Subject to
applicable insurance coverage, we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims, actions and investigations and for
any judgments, fines, civil or criminal penalties if such claims, actions or investigations are adversely determined.

A failure to keep pace with developments in technology
could impair our operations or competitive position.

Our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems
and technology. These systems and technologies must be refined, updated and replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis
in order for us to meet our customers’ demands and expectations. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable
cost parameters, or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train



our employees to operate any of these new systems, our business
could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology, such as fuel abatement
technologies, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results.

Our revenue is seasonal, owing to variations in passenger
fare rates and occupancy levels at different times of the year. We may not be able to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover
our expenses during certain periods of the year.

The demand for our cruises is seasonal, with the greatest demand
for cruises generally occurring during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. This seasonality in demand has resulted in
fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out
of service for Dry-docks, which we typically schedule during off-peak demand periods for such ships. Accordingly, seasonality in
demand and Dry-dock periods could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover the expenses we incur during
certain periods of the year.

Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment in Which We Operate

Future changes in applicable tax laws, or our inability
to take advantage of favorable tax regimes, could increase the amount of taxes we must pay.

We believe and have taken the position that our income that
is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental
to such income (“shipping income”), is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes under Section 883, based upon certain
assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “Item 1—Business—Taxation.”
The provisions of Section 883 are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.

We believe and have taken the position that substantially all
of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have
a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify
(or will not qualify) as shipping income. Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which NCLH
will satisfy complex stock ownership tests or the publicly traded test under Section 883 as described in “Item 1—Business—
Taxation—Exemption of International Shipping Income under Section 883 of the Code.” There are factual circumstances
beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH’s ordinary shares, which could cause us or
our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption. Finally, any changes in our operations could significantly increase
our exposure to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Regime (each as defined in “Item 1—Business—Taxation”),
and we can give no assurances on this matter.

If we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the
exemption under Section 883, our or such subsidiary’s U.S.-source income would be subject to either the Net Tax Regime or
the 4% Regime (each as defined in “Item 1— Business— Taxation). As of the date of this filing, we believe that
NCLH and its subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly traded test imposed under Section 883 and therefore believe that NCLH will
qualify for the exemption under Section 883. However, as discussed above, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that
could cause NCLH to not meet the stock ownership or publicly traded tests. Therefore, we can give no assurances on this matter.
We refer you to “Item 1—Business—Taxation.”

We may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income
taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file
tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal
income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations
involving foreign property that may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.

The various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result
in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. For example, legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from
U.S. federal income tax under Section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the U.S. Moreover,
we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or
future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the U.S. – U.K. Income Tax Treaty on
income derived in respect of our U.S.–flagged operation.

We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including
environmental laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations
could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue

Increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international
laws and regulations on environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, the IMO (a United Nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention
of marine pollution by ships), the Council of the European Union and individual countries and U.S. states are considering, as well
as implementing, new laws and rules to manage cruise ship operations. In addition, many aspects of the cruise industry are subject
to governmental regulation by the U.S. Coast Guard as well as international treaties such as SOLAS, an international safety regulation,
MARPOL, an international environmental regulation, and



STCW and its requirements for ship manning. In addition, some
environmental groups have lobbied for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the
cruise industry and its environmental impact.

The U.S. and various state and foreign government and regulatory
agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies aimed at reducing the threat of invasive species
in ballast water, requiring the use of low-sulfur fuels, increasing fuel efficiency requirements and further restricting emissions,
including those of green-house gases, and improving sewage and greywater-handling capabilities. Compliance with such laws and regulations
may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures which could adversely impact our operations
as well as our competitors’ operations.

Among the laws impacting cruise ship operations are a 2006 ballot
measure approved by Alaskan voters requiring that cruise ships meet Alaska Water Quality Standards (“WQS”). The law
was relaxed somewhat in 2013, allowing ship operators to apply for mixing zones in discharge permits, an option that may ease compliance
with certain WQS. The International Labor Organization’s Maritime Labor Convention, 2006 went into force on August 20, 2013.
The Convention regulates many aspects of maritime crew labor and impacts the worldwide sourcing of new crew members. MARPOL regulations
have established special ECAs with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions from fuel burning aboard ships.
Ships operating in designated ECAs (which include the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, and many of the waters within
200 nautical miles of the U.S. and Canadian coasts including the Hawaiian Islands and waters surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands) are generally expected to meet the new sulfur oxide emissions limits through the use of low-sulfur fuels or installation
of sulfur scrubbing technologies.

These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, areas
of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise
ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future. By virtue of our operations in the U.S., the FMC requires
us to maintain a third-party performance guarantee on our behalf in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation
and other obligations to guests. The FMC has proposed rules that would significantly increase the amount of our required guarantees
and accordingly our cost of compliance. There can be no assurance that such an increase in the amount of our guarantees, if required,
would be available to us. For additional discussion of the FMC’s proposed requirements, we refer you to “Item 1—Business—Regulatory
Issues.”

In 2007, the state of Alaska implemented taxes, some of which
were rolled back in 2010, which have impacted the cruise industry operating in Alaska. It is possible that other states, countries
or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically
applicable to the cruise industry and its employees and/or guests, which could increase our operating costs and/or could decrease
the demand for cruises.

Risks Related to NCLH’s Ordinary Shares

Shareholders of NCLH may have greater difficulties in
protecting their interests than shareholders of a U.S. corporation.

We are a Bermuda exempted company. The Companies Act 1981 of
Bermuda (the “Companies Act”), which applies to NCLH, differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to
U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Taken together with the provisions of NCLH’s bye-laws, some of these differences
may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of NCLH than you would have as a shareholder
of a U.S. corporation. This affects, among other things, the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director
are voidable, whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our Company,
what approvals are required for business combinations by our Company with a large shareholder or a wholly-owned subsidiary, what
rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the Companies Act or NCLH’s bye-laws, and the circumstances
under which we may indemnify our directors and officers.

NCLH does not currently pay dividends on its ordinary
shares.

NCLH does not currently pay dividends to its shareholders and
NCLH’s Board of Directors may never declare a dividend. Our existing debt agreements restrict, and any of our future debt
arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of NCLH’s subsidiaries, including NCLC, to pay distributions to
NCLH and NCLH’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. In addition, any determination to pay dividends in the
future will be entirely at the discretion of NCLH’s Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, cash
requirements, financial condition, business opportunities, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and
other factors that NCLH’s Board of Directors deems relevant. We are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends.
In addition, NCLH is a holding company and would depend upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to NCLH to
finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of NCLH. Investors seeking dividends should not purchase NCLH’s ordinary
shares.

Provisions in NCLH’s constitutional documents may
prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that NCLH’s shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.

NCLH’s bye-laws contain provisions that may delay, defer,
prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that its shareholders consider to be in their best interests. As a result,
these provisions may prevent NCLH’s shareholders from receiving a premium to the



market price of NCLH’s shares offered by a bidder in a
takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing
market price of NCLH’s shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. These provisions include
(subject to the shareholders’ agreement):

·

the ability of NCLH’s Board of Directors to designate one or more series of preference shares and issue preference shares
without shareholder approval;

·

a classified board of directors;

·

the sole power of a majority of NCLH’s Board of Directors to fix the number of directors;

·

the power of NCLH’s Board of Directors to fill any vacancy on NCLH’s Board of Directors in most circumstances,
including when such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise; and

·

advance notice requirements for nominating directors or introducing other business to be conducted at shareholder meetings.

Additionally, NCLH’s bye-laws contain provisions that
prevent third parties, other than the Apollo Holders, the TPG Viking Funds and Genting HK, from acquiring beneficial ownership
of more than 4.9% of its outstanding shares without the consent of NCLH’s Board of Directors and provide for the lapse of
rights, and sale, of any shares acquired in excess of that limit. The effect of these provisions may preclude third parties from
seeking to acquire a controlling interest in NCLH in transactions that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests
and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

Not applicable.

Item 2. Properties

Information about our cruise ships may be found under “Item
1. Business—Our Fleet” and “Item. 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

NCLH’s principal executive offices are located in Miami,
Florida where we lease approximately 313,600 square feet of facilities. We also have a lease of approximately 77,500 square feet
for Prestige’s former executive offices in Miami, Florida which we have subleased to a third party. We lease approximately
(i) 24,300 square feet of office space in Sunrise, Florida for sales; (ii) 13,900 square feet of office space in Southampton, England
for sales and marketing in the U.K. and Ireland; (iii) 14,900 square feet of office space in Wiesbaden, Germany for sales and marketing
in Europe; (iv) 31,000 square feet of office space in Phoenix, Arizona for a call center; (v) 17,600 square feet in Omaha, Nebraska
for a call center; and (vi) 46,000 square feet of warehouse space in Tampa, Florida for entertainment theatrical production.

Additionally, we lease a number of international offices throughout
Europe, Asia, South America and Australia to administer our brand operations globally. Norwegian owns a private island in the Bahamas,
Great Stirrup Cay, which we utilize as a port-of-call on some of our itineraries. We developed a cruise destination in Belize,
Harvest Caye, which was introduced in November 2016.

We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current
needs, and that we are capable of obtaining additional facilities as necessary.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of our business, various claims and lawsuits
have been filed or are pending against us. Most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and, accordingly, the maximum
amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount.

Nonetheless, the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits
that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time. We have evaluated our overall exposure with respect to all
of our threatened and pending litigation and, to the extent required, we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable losses
associated with our deemed exposure. We are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses beyond those accrued,
as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery. However,
based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that the aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses with respect
to these matters will be material to our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We intend to vigorously
defend our legal position on all claims and, to the extent necessary, seek recovery.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures

None.

As of February 16, 2018, there were 264 record holders of
NCLH’s ordinary shares. Since certain of NCLH’s ordinary shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf
of shareholders, the foregoing number is not representative of the number of beneficial owners.

Dividends

We intend to retain all currently available funds and as much
as necessary of future earnings in order to fund the continued development and growth of our business. Our debt agreements also
impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay distributions to NCLH and NCLH’s ability to pay dividends to
its shareholders. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will
depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, restrictions imposed by applicable law and our financing agreements
and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer

On April 29, 2014, NCLH’s Board of Directors authorized,
and NCLH announced, a three-year share repurchase program for up to $500.0 million. The share repurchase program was scheduled
to expire on April 29, 2017, but was extended through April 29, 2020. NCLH may make repurchases in the open market, in privately
negotiated transactions, in accelerated repurchase programs or in structured share repurchase programs, and any repurchases may
be made pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans. There was no share repurchase activity during the three months ended December 31, 2017,
and as of December 31, 2017, $263.5 million remained available for repurchases of our outstanding ordinary shares under the share
repurchase program.

Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Financial Presentation

Revenue from our cruise and cruise-related activities are categorized
by us as “passenger ticket revenue” and “onboard and other revenue.” Passenger ticket revenue and onboard
and other revenue vary according to product offering, the size of the ship in operation, the length of cruises operated and the
markets in which the ship operates. Our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises, which has historically been strongest
during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months.

Passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations,
meals in certain restaurants on the ship, certain onboard entertainment, and includes revenue for service charges and air and land
transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us. Onboard and other revenue primarily consists
of revenue from gaming, beverage sales, shore excursions, specialty dining, retail sales, spa services, photo services as well
as certain Bareboat Charter revenue. We also record onboard revenue from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed
by independent concessionaires, from which we receive a share of their revenue.

Our cruise operating expense is classified as follows:

·

Commissions, transportation and other primarily consists of direct costs associated with
    passenger ticket revenue. These costs include travel agent commissions, air and land transportation expenses, related credit
    card fees, certain port expenses and the costs associated with shore excursions and hotel accommodations included as part of
    the overall cruise purchase price.

·

Onboard and other primarily consists of direct costs that are incurred in connection with onboard and other revenue. These include costs incurred in connection with gaming, beverage sales and shore excursions.

·

Payroll and related consists of the cost of wages and benefits for shipboard employees and costs of certain inventory items, including food, for a third party that provides crew and other hotel services for certain ships.

·

Fuel includes fuel costs, the impact of certain fuel hedges and fuel delivery costs.

·

Food consists of food costs for passengers and crew on certain ships.

·

Other consists of repairs and maintenance (including Dry-dock costs), ship insurance and other ship expenses.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented.
We rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make
these estimates and judgments. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We believe that the following critical
accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
These critical accounting policies, which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements,
relate to ship accounting, asset impairment and contingencies.

Ship Accounting

Ships represent our most significant assets, and we record them
at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of ships is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives
of primarily 30 years after a 15% reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship. Improvement costs that we believe add
value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives
or the remaining useful life of the ship. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred. We account for
Dry-dock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all Dry-dock costs as incurred.



We determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on
our estimates of the average useful life of the ships’ major component systems, such as cabins, main diesels, main electric,
superstructure and hull. In addition, we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions
and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. Given the large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates
related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently
uncertain. Should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual
values, depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher. If circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making
determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance
costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we reduced our estimated average 30-year ship
service life by one year, depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have increased by $12.2 million.
In addition, if our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for the same period would have increased
by $59.4 million. We believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied. We believe
that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit
from the ships’ usage.

Asset Impairment

We review our long-lived assets, principally ships, for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped
and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of
other groups of assets. We consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment
and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the
impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. We estimate fair value based on the best information
available utilizing estimates, judgments and projections as necessary. Our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting
expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk.

We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently
when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. For
our evaluation of goodwill we use the Step 0 Test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is
more likely than not (i.e., more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In order to
make this evaluation, we consider whether any of the following factors or conditions exist:

·

Changes in general macroeconomic
conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions; limitations on accessing capital; fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates; or other developments in equity and credit markets;

·

Changes in industry and market conditions such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates; an increased competitive environment; a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (in both absolute terms and relative to peers); a change in the market for an entity’s products or services; or a regulatory or political development;

·

Changes in cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows;

·

Decline in overall financial performance (for both actual and expected performance);

·

Entity and reporting unit specific negative events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; litigation; or a change in the composition or carrying amount of net assets; and

·

Decline in share price (in both absolute terms and relative to peers).

We believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our long-lived
assets, principally ships, goodwill, tradenames and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable. Nonetheless, if there
was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions
or circumstances that influence such assets, we could be required to record an impairment charge. If a material change occurred,
we may conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill.
This is called the Step I Test which consists of a combined approach using the expected future cash flows and market multiples
to determine the fair value of the reporting units.

For our annual impairment evaluation, we performed a Step 0
Test for the Norwegian, Regent Seven Seas and Oceania Cruises reporting units. As of December 31, 2017, there was $523.0 million,
$462.1 million and $403.8 million of goodwill for the Oceania Cruises, Regent Seven Seas and Norwegian reporting units, respectively.
As of December 31, 2017, our annual review consisting of the Step 0 Test supports the carrying value of these assets.



Contingencies

Periodically, we assess potential liabilities related to any
lawsuits or claims brought against us or any asserted claims, including tax, legal and/or environmental matters. Although it is
typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if
it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable
estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the
amount of insurance recoveries, if any. In accordance with the guidance on accounting for contingencies, we accrue a liability
when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Although we believe that our estimates and
judgments are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance
recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimated provisions
or previous disclosures.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Net Revenue,
Adjusted Net Revenue, Net Yield, Adjusted Net Yield, Net Cruise Cost, Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel, Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS, to enable us to analyze our performance. See “Terms Used in this Annual Report”
for the definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Net Revenue and Net Yield to manage our business on a day-to-day
basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by
us net of significant variable costs. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income,
we believe changes in Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.

As our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment
of vessels outside of the U.S., a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly British
pound, Canadian dollar, euro and Australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting
currency, the U.S. dollar. In order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations, we calculate certain non-GAAP measures on
a Constant Currency basis, whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S.
dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures on both a reported
and Constant Currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business.

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as a supplemental
financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful
measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating
costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term
under GAAP nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income,
as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest
payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.

In addition, Adjusted Net Revenue and Adjusted Net
Yield, which exclude certain business combination accounting entries, are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are
useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our operating business and provide greater transparency into
our results of operations. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts
and are used to supplement GAAP net income and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures
of our earnings performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP
financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP
financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance. In addition,
management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. The amounts excluded in the
presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of Adjusted
Net Revenue, Adjusted Net Yield, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS may not be indicative of future adjustments or results.
For example, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a write-off of $11.2 million of deferred financing fees due to
the refinancing of certain credit facilities, a similar write-off was not incurred in either of the years ended December 31,
2017 or December 31, 2015. We included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income since this amount
was not representative of our day-to-day operations and we have included similar non-representative adjustments in prior
periods.

You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating
our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis.
In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments
in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures
in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial
measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures
to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “Results of Operations”
section.



Summary of Significant 2017 Events

In October 2017, we (a) repriced and increased the then existing
$750 million revolving credit facility with a new $875 million revolving credit facility (the “New Revolving Loan Facility”),
(b) repriced the approximately $1,412 million principal amount outstanding under the existing senior secured term A facility (the
“New Term A Loan Facility”), and (c) added a new $375 million term B loan facility due 2021. Also, we completed the
redemption of all of our then outstanding 4.625% Senior Notes due 2020 (“Notes”), at a price including accrued and
unpaid interest, of $1,044.41 per $1,000 of outstanding principal amount of Notes. No Notes remained outstanding after the redemption.

In April 2017, Norwegian Joy was delivered.

In February 2017, we announced Project Leonardo, under which
we plan to introduce an additional four ships with expected delivery dates through 2025. We have an option to introduce two additional
ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027, subject to certain conditions. These four Project Leonardo ships are each 140,000 gross tons
with approximately 3,300 Berths. The contract price for each of the four ships is approximately €800.0 million, subject to
certain conditions, or $960.4 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2017. We have obtained export credit financing
for the ships which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2025,
subject to certain conditions.

Executive Overview

for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 11.2% to $4.2 billion from $3.8 billion in the same period in 2016 with an
improvement in Net Yield of 4.9% and an increase in Capacity Days of 6.0%.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had net income and
diluted EPS of $759.9 million and $3.31, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had net income and diluted EPS

We had Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS of $907.7 million
and $3.96, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, which includes $147.8 million of adjustments primarily consisting
of expenses related to non-cash compensation, amortization of intangible assets, write-offs of fees related to extinguishment of

Year Ended December 31, 2017 (“2017”) Compared
to Year Ended December 31, 2016 (“2016”)

Revenue

Total revenue increased 10.7% to $5.4 billion in 2017 compared
to $4.9 billion in 2016 primarily due to an increase in Capacity Days and improved pricing. Gross Yield increased 4.4%. Net Revenue
in 2017 increased 11.2% to $4.2 billion from $3.8 billion in 2016 due to an increase in Capacity Days of 6.0% and an increase
in Net Yield of 4.9%. The increase in Capacity Days was primarily due to the delivery of Norwegian Joy in April 2017, the delivery
of Seven Seas Explorer in June 2016 and Sirena joining our fleet in April 2016. The increase in Net Yield was primarily due to
improved pricing. Adjusted Net Revenue includes a deferred revenue fair value adjustment of $1.0 million in 2016 related to the
Acquisition of Prestige. On a Constant Currency basis, Net Yield and Adjusted Net Yield increased 5.1% and 5.0%, respectively,
in 2017 compared to 2016.

Expense

Total cruise operating expense increased 7.5% in 2017 compared
to 2016 primarily due to the increase in Capacity Days as discussed above and an increase in marketing, general and administrative
expenses. Gross Cruise Cost increased 9.1% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to an increase in marketing, general and administrative
expenses and total cruise operating expense. Total other operating expense increased 16.8% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due
to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and marketing, general and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization
expense increased primarily due to the ship additions and ship improvement projects. The increase in marketing, general and administrative
expense was primarily due to pay for performance incentive expenses. On a Capacity Day basis, Net Cruise Cost increased 2.9% on
an actual and a Constant Currency basis, due to the increases in expenses discussed above. Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel
per Capacity Day increased 2.9% primarily due to the expenses discussed above (2.8% on a Constant Currency basis). We refer you
to the “Results of Operations” above for a reconciliation of total cruise operating expense to Adjusted Net Cruise
Cost Excluding Fuel.

Interest expense, net was $267.8 million in 2017 compared to
$276.9 million in 2016.  Interest expense for 2017 reflects higher interest rates due to an increase in LIBOR, as well as
an increase in average debt balances outstanding primarily associated with the delivery of new ships and newbuild installments. 
In connection with refinancings of our senior notes and certain of our credit facilities, interest expense, net included losses
on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of $23.9 million in 2017 and $39.2 million in 2016.

Other income (expense), net was an expense of $10.4 million
in 2017 compared to an expense of $8.3 million in 2016. In 2017, the expense was primarily related to losses on foreign currency
exchange. In 2016, the expense was primarily related to $16.1 million of unrealized and realized losses on fuel swap derivative
hedge contracts partially offset by $4.5 million of gains on foreign currency exchange and $3.9 million of gains on foreign currency
exchange derivative hedge contracts.

In 2017, we had an income tax expense of $10.7 million compared
to $7.2 million in 2016. The expense in 2017 had benefits of $7.7 million from the impact on our net deferred tax liabilities of
a change in both U.S. and U.K. tax rates due to tax reform and a reversal of prior years’



contingency reserves of $11.6 million. The expense in 2016 had
a benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance of $3.6 million.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 (“2016”) Compared
to Year Ended December 31, 2015 (“2015”)

Revenue

Total revenue increased 12.2% to $4.9 billion in 2016 compared
to $4.3 billion in 2015 primarily due to an increase in Capacity Days and improved pricing. Gross Yield increased 0.7%. Net Revenue
in 2016 increased 13.8% to $3.8 billion from $3.3 billion in 2015 due to an increase in Capacity Days of 11.4% and an increase
in Net Yield of 2.1%. The increase in Capacity Days was primarily due to the delivery of Norwegian Escape in October 2015, Sirena
joining our fleet in April 2016 and the delivery of Seven Seas Explorer in June 2016. The increase in Net Yield was primarily
due to improved pricing. Adjusted Net Revenue includes a deferred revenue fair value adjustment of $32.4 million in 2015 related
to the Acquisition of Prestige. On a Constant Currency basis, Net Yield and Adjusted Net Yield increased 2.8% and 1.8%, respectively,
in 2016 compared to 2015.

Expense

Total cruise operating expense increased 7.3% in 2016 compared
to 2015 primarily due to the increase in Capacity Days as discussed above and an increase in marketing, general and administrative
expenses. Gross Cruise Cost increased 9.5% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase in total cruise operating expense and marketing,
general and administrative expenses. Total other operating expense increased 11.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an
increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses which included an increase in marketing expenses of $38.3 million and
share-based compensation of $16.4 million. The increase was also due to income of $43.4 million related to a contingent consideration
adjustment on the Acquisition of Prestige in 2015 which did not occur in 2016. Depreciation and amortization expense was relatively
unchanged as the increase due to the addition of Norwegian Escape and ship improvement projects in 2016 was offset by the recognition
in 2015 of an incremental $51.6 million of amortization of intangible assets due to the Acquisition of Prestige. On a Capacity
Day basis, Net Cruise Cost decreased slightly on an actual and a Constant Currency basis, due to a decrease in fuel expense partially
offset by the increases in expenses discussed above. The average fuel price decreased 13.5% to $466 per metric ton in 2016 from
$539 per metric ton in 2015. Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day increased 1.5% primarily due to the expenses
discussed above (1.7% on a Constant Currency basis). We refer you to the “Results of Operations” above for a reconciliation
of total cruise operating expense to Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel.

Interest expense, net increased to $276.9 million in 2016 from
$221.9 million in 2015 primarily due to an increase in average debt balances outstanding primarily associated with the delivery
of new ships and newbuild installments as well as from higher interest rates due to an increase in LIBOR. Additionally, in connection
with refinancings of our senior notes and certain of our credit facilities, interest expense, net included losses on extinguishment
of debt and debt modification costs of $39.2 million in 2016 and losses on extinguishment of debt of $12.6 million in 2015.

Other income (expense), net was an expense of $8.3 million in
2016 compared to an expense of $46.7 million in 2015. In 2016, the expense was primarily related to $16.1 million of unrealized
and realized losses on fuel swap derivative hedge contracts partially offset by $4.5 million of gains on foreign currency exchange
and $3.9 million of gains on foreign currency exchange derivative hedge contracts. In 2015, the expense was primarily related to
$30.7 million of losses from the dedesignation of certain fuel swap derivative hedge contracts and the ineffectiveness of settled
fuel swaps in 2015. Also included in 2015 was an expense of $26.2 million related to the fair value adjustment of a foreign exchange
collar which does not receive hedge accounting treatment partially offset by $11.0 million of foreign currency transaction gains.

In 2016, we had an income tax expense of $7.2 million compared
to $6.8 million in 2015. The expense in 2016 had a benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance of $3.6 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

As of December 31, 2017, our liquidity was $973.2 million
consisting of $176.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $797.0 million available under our New Revolving Loan Facility. Our
primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital, capital expenditures and debt service.

As of December 31, 2017, we had a working capital deficit
of $2.0 billion. This deficit included $1.3 billion of advance ticket sales, which represents the total revenue we collect in advance
of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities.
Our business model, along with our New Revolving Loan Facility, allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet
our operating, investing and financing needs.

We evaluate potential sources of additional liquidity, including
the capital markets, in the ordinary course of business. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure,
taking into consideration our current and expected capital requirements, our assessment of prevailing market conditions and expectations
regarding future conditions, and the contractual and other restrictions to which we are subject.



Our existing debt agreements restrict, and any of our future
debt arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions and/or to pay dividends
to NCLC and NCLH’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. NCLH is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries
for their ability to pay distributions to NCLH to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of NCLH. However, we do not
believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations.

Sources and Uses of Cash

In this section, references to 2017 refer to the year
ended December 31, 2017, references to 2016 refer to the year ended December 31, 2016 and references to 2015 refer to
the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion in
2017 compared to $1.2 billion in 2016 and $1.0 billion in 2015. The change in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017
reflects net income of $759.9 million, as well as timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to various operating
assets and liabilities including advance ticket sales of $154.0 million. The change in net cash provided by operating activities
in 2016 reflects net income of $633.1 million compared to net income of $427.1 million in 2015, as well as timing differences in
cash receipts and payments relating to various operating assets and liabilities, including advance ticket sales of $135.0 million
in 2016 and $218.3 million in 2015.

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.4 billion in 2017
primarily related to payments for the delivery of Norwegian Joy, ship improvements, ships under construction and shoreside projects.
Net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion in 2016, primarily related to payments for the delivery of Seven Seas Explorer,
ship improvements, ships under construction and shoreside projects. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion in 2015,
primarily related to payments for the delivery of Norwegian Escape, ships under construction, ship improvements and shoreside projects.

Net cash used in financing activities was $133.0 million in
2017, primarily due to the repayments of our 4.625% senior unsecured notes, our net repayment of our New Revolving Loan Facility,
other loan facilities and deferred financing fees and other, partially offset by the proceeds from our Breakaway four loan facility.
Net cash used in financing activities was $98.3 million in 2016, primarily from the repayments of our 5.25% senior unsecured notes,
net repayments of our then existing revolving loan facility and other loan facilities, the repurchase of our ordinary shares and
payments for and deferred financing fees and other, partially offset by issuance of our $700.0 million 4.750% senior unsecured
notes. Net cash provided by financing activities was $195.2 million in 2015, primarily from the issuance of our $600.0 million
4.625% senior unsecured notes, borrowings related to our then existing revolving loan facility and our Breakaway three loan facility
for the delivery of Norwegian Escape, partially offset by redemption of our $300.0 million 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2018
and repayments on our then existing revolving loan facility and other loan facilities.

Future Capital Commitments

Future capital commitments consist of contracted
commitments, including ship construction contracts, and future expected capital expenditures necessary for operations as well
as our ship refurbishment projects. As of December 31, 2017, anticipated capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion
and $0.8 billion for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We have export credit financing in
place for the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts of $0.8 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.5 billion
for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. These future expected capital expenditures will
significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense as we take delivery of the ships.

Project Leonardo will introduce an additional four ships with
expected delivery dates through 2025. We have an option to introduce two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027, subject
to certain conditions. These four Project Leonardo ships are each approximately 140,000 Gross Tons with approximately 3,300 Berths.
We have an Explorer Class Ship, Seven Seas Splendor, on order for delivery in the winter of 2020. This ship is approximately 55,000
Gross Tons and 750 Berths. We have two Breakaway Plus Class Ships, Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Encore, on order for delivery
in the spring of 2018 and fall of 2019, respectively. These ships are approximately 168,000 Gross Tons each with approximately
4,000 Berths each. The combined contract price of these seven ships was approximately €5.5 billion, or $6.6 billion based
on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2017. We have obtained export credit financing for the ships which is
expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2025, subject to certain
conditions. For ships expected to be delivered after 2023, the contract prices are subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.

In connection with the contracts to build these ships, we do
not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellation to occur. However, if any would occur, it could result in, among other
things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us, subject to certain refund guarantees, and potential claims and
impairment losses which may materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2017,
2016 and 2015 was $29.0 million, $33.7 million and $31.9 million, respectively, primarily associated with the construction of our
newbuild ships.

Other

Certain service providers may require collateral in the normal
course of our business. The amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions.

As a routine part of our business, depending on market conditions,
exchange rates, pricing and our strategy for growth, we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building
of additional ships. We may also consider the sale of ships, potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these transactions
were to occur, they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness, through cash flows from operations,
or through the issuance of debt, equity or equity-related securities.

Funding Sources

Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that, among
other things, require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity, as well as limit our net funded debt-to-capital ratio, maintain
certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends. Substantially all of our ships and other property and equipment
are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt. We believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2017.

The impact of changes in world economies and especially the
global credit markets can create a challenging environment and may reduce future consumer demand for cruises and adversely affect
our counterparty credit risks. In the event this environment deteriorates, our business, financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely impacted.

We believe our cash on hand, expected future operating cash
inflows, additional available borrowings under our New Revolving Loan Facility and our ability to issue debt securities or additional
equity securities, will be sufficient to fund operations, debt payment requirements, capital expenditures and maintain compliance
with covenants under our debt agreements over the next twelve-month period. There is no assurance that cash flows from operations
and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations.



Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about
Market Risk

General

We are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal
operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives. The financial impacts of these derivative instruments are
primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching the notional,
term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or
other speculative purposes. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses.

Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2017, we had interest rate swap agreements
to hedge our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense. As of December 31, 2017, 54% of our debt was
fixed and 46% was variable, which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps. The notional amount of outstanding debt associated
with the interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2017 was $218.6 million. Based on our December 31, 2017 outstanding variable
rate debt balance, a one percentage point increase in annual LIBOR interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by
approximately $29.4 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2017, we had foreign currency derivatives
to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in
euros. These derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the payments on our ship construction contracts.
The payments not hedged aggregate €3.3 billion, or $4.0 billion based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December
31, 2017. We estimate that a 10% change in the euro as of December 31, 2017 would result in a $0.4 billion change in the U.S. dollar
value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments.

Fuel Price Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates
to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships. Fuel expense, as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense, was 11.8%
for each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and 13.5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. We use
fuel derivative agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of December 31, 2017, we had
hedged approximately 65%, 48% and 26% of our 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, projected metric tons of fuel purchases. We estimate
that a 10% increase in our weighted-average fuel price would increase our anticipated 2018 fuel expense by $38.0 million. This
increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of $20.6 million. Fair value of
our derivative contracts is derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach. These valuation models take
into account the contract terms such as maturity, as well as other inputs such as fuel types, fuel curves, creditworthiness of
the counterparty and the Company, as well as other data points.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Our Financial Statements and Quarterly Selected Financial Data
are included beginning on page F-1 of this report.

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants
on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of December 31, 2017. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness
of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding
of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance
of achieving their control objectives. Based upon management’s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2017 to provide reasonable
assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding



required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO
Framework”). Based on this evaluation under the COSO Framework, management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included on page F-1.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met.
In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.
Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only the reasonable assurance that our controls will
succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions.

Item 9B. Other Information

appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and
on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect
to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1.

Description of Business and Organization

We are a leading global cruise company which operates
the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. As of December 31, 2017, we had 25 ships with
approximately 50,400 Berths. We plan to introduce seven additional ships through 2025 and we have an option to introduce two additional
ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027, subject to certain conditions. Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Encore are on order for delivery
in the spring of 2018 and fall of 2019, respectively. We also have an Explorer Class Ship, Seven Seas Splendor, on order for delivery
in the winter of 2020. Project Leonardo will introduce an additional four ships with expected delivery dates through 2025. These
additions to our fleet (exclusive of the option for two additional ships) will increase our total Berths to approximately 72,300.

Norwegian commenced operations from Miami in 1966.
In February 2000, Genting HK acquired control of and subsequently became the sole owner of the Norwegian operations.

In January 2008, the Apollo Holders acquired 50%
of the outstanding ordinary share capital of NCLC. As part of this investment, the Apollo Holders assumed control of NCLC’s
Board of Directors. Also, in January 2008, the TPG Viking Funds acquired, in the aggregate, 12.5% of NCLC’s outstanding share
capital from the Apollo Holders.

In February 2011, NCLH, a Bermuda limited company,
was formed with the issuance to the Sponsors of, in aggregate, 10,000 ordinary shares, with a par value of $.001 per share. In
January 2013, NCLH completed its IPO, pursuant to which it sold 27,058,824 ordinary shares for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and expenses, of approximately $473.9 million. In connection with the consummation of the IPO, the Sponsors’
ordinary shares in NCLC were exchanged for the ordinary shares of NCLH, and NCLH became the owner of 100% of the ordinary shares
and parent company of NCLC (the “Corporate Reorganization”). At the same time, NCLH contributed $460.0 million to NCLC
and the historical financial statements of NCLC became those of NCLH. The Corporate Reorganization was effected solely for the
purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure. NCLH had not, prior to the completion of the Corporate Reorganization, conducted
any activities other than those incidental to its formation and to prepare for the Corporate Reorganization and the IPO. As the
economic position of the investors did not change as part of the Corporate Reorganization it was considered a nonstubstantive merger
from an accounting perspective.

In November 2014, we completed the Acquisition of
Prestige. We believe that the combination of Norwegian and Prestige creates a cruise operating company with a rich product portfolio
and strong market presence.

The Sponsors have completed numerous Secondary Equity
Offerings and as of December 31, 2017 have reduced their ownership to 16.8% of NCLH’s ordinary shares (we refer you to Note
7— “Related Party Disclosures”).

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

Our consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and contain all normal recurring
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. Estimates are required for the preparation
of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and actual results could differ
from these estimates. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassification

Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified
to properly reflect promotional discounts allocated between passenger ticket revenue to onboard and other revenue. During the fourth
quarter of 2017 we reclassified $21.9 million of revenue from passenger ticket revenue to onboard and other revenue for the prior
three quarters. This cumulative adjustment for 2017 amends the multi-element allocation of revenue between these two financial
statement line items. This change does not impact total revenue or net income, nor did it impact any periods in 2016 or 2015.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, and
include cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less at acquisition and also include amounts due from
credit card processors.

F-



Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of cash collateral in respect
of certain agreements and is included in prepaid expenses and other assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance
sheets.

Accounts Receivable, Net

Accounts receivable are shown net of an allowance for
doubtful accounts of $5.9 million and $4.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories mainly consist of provisions, supplies and
fuel and are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method of accounting.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred except for
those that result in tangible assets, including brochures, which are treated as prepaid expenses and charged to expense as consumed.
Advertising costs of $2.4 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are included in prepaid
expenses and other assets. Expenses related to advertising costs totaled $289.1 million, $270.5 million and $232.2 million for
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Earnings Per Share

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the
basic weighted-average number of shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by diluted
weighted-average shares outstanding. A reconciliation between basic and diluted EPS was as follows (in thousands, except share
and per share data):

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
a total of 5.6 million, 7.1 million and 2.8 million shares, respectively, have been excluded from diluted weighted-average shares
outstanding because the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive.

Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals
and improvements that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as a cost of the ship while costs of repairs and maintenance,
including Dry-dock costs, are charged to expense as incurred. During ship construction, certain interest is capitalized as a cost
of the ship. Gains or losses on the sale of property and equipment are recorded as a component of operating income (expense) in
our consolidated statements of operations.

Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, after a 15% reduction for the estimated residual values of ships as follows:

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment, based
on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows
that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. We consider historical performance and future estimated
results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash
flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying

F-



amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted
future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. We
estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates, judgments and projections as necessary. Our estimate
of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated
risk.

Goodwill and Tradenames

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair
value of net assets acquired. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets, principally tradenames, are reviewed for impairment on
an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of these
assets may not be fully recoverable. We use the Step 0 Test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether
it is more likely than not (i.e., more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For tradenames
we also provide a qualitative assessment to determine if there is any indication of impairment. In order to make this evaluation,
we consider the following circumstances as well as others:

·

Changes in general macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions; limitations on accessing capital; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; or other developments in equity and credit markets;

·

Changes in industry and market conditions such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates; an increased competitive environment; a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (in both absolute terms and relative to peers); a change in the market for an entity’s products or services; or a regulatory or political development;

·

Changes in cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows;

·

Decline in overall financial performance (for both actual and expected performance);

·

Entity and reporting unit specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; litigation; or a change in the composition or carrying amount of net assets; and

·

Decline in share price (in both absolute terms and relative to peers).

We have concluded that our business has three reporting
units. Each brand, Norwegian, Regent and Oceania Cruises, constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available
and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment.

For our annual impairment evaluation, we performed a
Step 0 Test for the Norwegian, Regent Seven Seas and Oceania Cruises reporting units. As of December 31, 2017, there was $523.0
million, $462.1 million and $403.8 million of goodwill for the Oceania Cruises, Regent Seven Seas and Norwegian reporting units,
respectively. As of December 31, 2017, our annual review consisting of the Step 0 Test supports the carrying value of these
assets.

Revenue and Expense Recognition

Deposits received from guests for future voyages are
recorded as advance ticket sales and are subsequently recognized as passenger ticket revenue on a pro-rata basis over the period
of the voyage, concurrent with recognition of onboard and other revenue and with recognition of all associated direct costs of
a voyage as cruise operating expenses. Guest cancellation fees are recognized in passenger ticket revenue in the month of the cancellation.
Certain of our product offerings are accounted for under the guidance included within multi-element arrangements and result in
an allocation of the fair value between passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue.

Revenue and expenses include port fees and taxes. The
amounts included on a gross basis are $327.4 million, $286.6 million and $243.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively.

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability
are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent
with debt discounts. For line of credit arrangements and for those debt facilities not fully drawn we defer and present debt issuance
costs as an asset. These deferred issuance costs are amortized over the life of the loan agreement. The amortization of deferred
financing fees is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of cash flows; however, for
purposes of the consolidated statements of operations it is included in interest expense, net.

F-



Foreign Currency

The majority of our transactions are settled in U.S.
dollars. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in other currencies are recognized in income at each balance sheet
date. We recognized losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $14.2 million and gains were approximately $4.5 million and
$11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity

We enter into derivative contracts to reduce our exposure
to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices. The criteria used to determine whether a transaction
qualifies for hedge accounting treatment includes the correlation between fluctuations in the fair value of the hedged item and
the fair value of the related derivative instrument and its effectiveness as a hedge. As the derivative is marked to fair value,
we elected an accounting policy to net the fair value of our derivatives when a master netting arrangement exists with our counterparties.

A derivative instrument that hedges a forecasted transaction
or the variability of cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability may be designated as a cash flow hedge. Changes in
fair value of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) until the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings. To the extent that an instrument is not effective
as a hedge, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Realized
gains and losses related to our effective fuel hedges are recognized in fuel expense. For presentation in our consolidated statements
of cash flows, we have elected to classify the cash flows from our cash flow hedges in the same category as the cash flows from
the items being hedged.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

We monitor concentrations of credit risk associated
with financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business. Credit risk, including but not limited to counterparty
non-performance under derivative instruments, our New Revolving Loan Facility and new ship progress payment guarantees, is not
considered significant, as we primarily conduct business with large, well-established financial institutions and insurance companies
that we have well-established relationships with and that have credit risks acceptable to us or the credit risk is spread out among
a large number of creditors. We do not anticipate non-performance by any of our significant counterparties.

Insurance

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance
for a number of risks including claims related to crew and guests, hull and machinery, war risk, workers’ compensation, property
damage, employee healthcare and general liability. Liabilities associated with certain of these risks, including crew and passenger
claims, are estimated actuarially based upon known facts, historical trends and a reasonable estimate of future expenses. While
we believe these accruals are adequate, the ultimate losses incurred may differ from those recorded.

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in
accordance with the liability method. Deferred taxes are recorded using the currently enacted tax rates that apply in the periods
that the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred taxes are not discounted.

We provide a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets
when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. With respect to acquired deferred tax assets, future reversals
of the valuation allowance will first be applied against goodwill and other intangible assets before recognition of a benefit in
our consolidated statements of operations.

Share-Based Compensation

We recognize expense for our share-based compensation
awards using a fair-value-based method. Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards
that are based on a service period and not contingent upon any future performance. We refer you to Note 9—“Employee
Benefits and Share-Based Compensation.”

Segment Reporting

We have concluded that our business has a single reportable
segment. Each brand, Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available
and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment. Our operating
segments have similar economic and qualitative characteristics, including similar long-term margins and similar products and services;
therefore, we aggregate all of the operating segments into one reportable segment.

Although we sell cruises on an international basis,
our passenger ticket revenue is primarily attributed to U.S.-sourced guests

F-



who make reservations in the U.S. Revenue attributable
to U.S.-sourced guests was 77%, 81% and 75% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No other individual
country’s revenues exceeded 10% in any of our last three years.

seven ships with Marshall Island registry with a carrying value of $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. We also have
one ship with U.S. registry with a carrying value of $0.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Recently Issued Accounting Guidance

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(“the Act”) was enacted. Among other provisions, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35%
to 21%. The SEC staff issued SAB No. 118, which addresses how a company recognizes provisional amounts when a company does
not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete
its accounting for the effect of the changes in the Act. The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared
and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year.  As of December
31, 2017, we have not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, as described below, we
have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances. These amounts are provisional and subject
to change.  The most significant impact of the Act for the Company was a $7.4 million reduction of the value of
net deferred tax liabilities (which represent future tax expenses) that was recorded as a discrete tax benefit as a result
of lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The tax benefit represents a provisional amount and
the Company’s current best estimates. Any adjustments recorded to the provisional amount through the end of 2018 will
be included in income from operations as an adjustment to tax expense. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions
made based upon the Company’s current interpretation of the Act and may change as the Company receives
additional clarification and implementation guidance.  Other aspects of the Act are either not applicable or not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-12

.

The objectives of this
ASU are to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s
risk management activities in its financial statements and to make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of
the hedge accounting guidance in current GAAP. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and
interim periods within those fiscal years. We will adopt in the first quarter of 2018. For cash flow hedges, a cumulative-effect
adjustment relating to the elimination of the separate measurement of ineffectiveness to accumulated other comprehensive income
is required with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The presentation and disclosure guidance
is required prospectively.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 which
simplifies the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill
impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
The guidance is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early
adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not
expect to early adopt this guidance. We will evaluate the impact upon adoption of this guidance to our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16 which
requires companies to recognize the income-tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the
transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. We will adopt the new standard effective January
1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment of $19.1 million to retained
earnings as of the effective date. The cumulative-effect adjustment captures the write-off of previously unamortized deferred income
tax expense from past intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory, and recognition of any new deferred tax assets,
net of necessary valuation allowance and other liabilities for amounts not previously recognized under U.S. GAAP.

F-



In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 which
amends Topic 230 (Statement of Cash Flows) to eliminate discrepancies in reporting certain items in the statement of cash flows.
We will adopt a retrospective application in the first quarter of 2018. Currently, the only transactions that will require a reclassification
is in connection with our debt extinguishment and deferred financing fees.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 which
sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract
(i.e. lessees and lessors). The ASU requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and
obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The ASU further modifies lessors’ classification criteria
for leases and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The ASU will also require qualitative and quantitative
disclosures designed to give financial statement users additional information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows
arising from leases. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning
after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The ASU is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. To evaluate
the impact of the adoption of this guidance, we are currently reviewing our existing leases and evaluating contracts to determine
what might be considered a lease under the new guidance.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 which requires
entities to recognize revenue through the application of a five-step model, including identification of the contract, identification
of the performance obligations, determination of the transaction price, allocation of the transaction price to the performance
obligation and recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligations. We will adopt a modified retrospective
application in the first quarter of 2018. We have reviewed our contract and business processes and we are concluding on changes
to our controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements. Based on our evaluation to date, we determined no significant
changes are required to our business processes, systems and controls to effectively report revenue recognition under the new standard.
Upon adoption we will reclassify to prepaid expenses and other assets from advanced ticket sales certain deferred costs incurred
to obtain our contracts. Adoption of the new standard will require additional disclosures, however, it is not expected to
materially change the timing, classification or amount of revenue recognized in our consolidated financial statements.

NCLC, a subsidiary of NCLH, entered into a Third Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 10, 2017, with a subsidiary of NCLC, as co-borrower and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. (“JPM”), as administrative agent. This facility revised the $750.0 million senior secured credit facility to,
among other things, (a) reprice and increase the existing $750 million revolving credit facility to a new $875 million revolving
credit facility (the “New Revolving Loan Facility”), (b) reprice the approximately $1,412 million principal amount
outstanding under the existing senior secured term A facility to (the “New Term A Loan Facility”), and (c) add a new
$375 million term B loan facility due 2021 (the “New Term B Loan Facility”). The applicable margin under the New Term
A Loan Facility and New Revolving Loan Facility is determined by reference to a total leverage ratio, with an applicable margin
of between 2.00% and 1.25% with respect to Eurocurrency loans and between 1.00% and 0.25% with respect to base rate loans. The
margin for borrowings under the New Term A Loan Facility and New Revolving Loan Facility is 1.75% with respect to Eurocurrency
borrowings and 0.75% with respect to base rate borrowings. The applicable margin under the New Term B Loan Facility is 1.75% with
respect to Eurocurrency loans and 0.75% with respect to base rate loans. NCLC used proceeds from the New Term B Loan Facility and
cash on hand for the Redemption (as defined below).

Concurrent with the refinancing of its loan facilities
as described above, on October 10, 2017, NCLC completed the redemption of all its outstanding 4.625% Senior Notes due 2020 (“Notes”),
at a price including accrued and unpaid interest, of $1,044.41 per $1,000 of outstanding principal amount of Notes so redeemed
(the “Redemption”) using the proceeds from the New Term Loan B Facility and cash on hand. No Notes remained outstanding
after the redemption.

Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31,
2017 was $267.8 million which included $32.5 million of amortization of deferred financing fees and a $23.9 million loss on extinguishment
of debt. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $276.9 million which included $34.7 million of amortization
of deferred financing fees and a $27.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31,
2015 was $221.9 million which included $36.7 million of amortization of deferred financing fees and a $12.7 million loss on extinguishment
of debt.

Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that,
among other things, require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity, as well as limit our net funded debt-to-capital ratio,
maintain certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends. Substantially all of our ships and other property and
equipment are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt. We believe we were in compliance with our covenants as of December
31, 2017.

Genting HK owns our ordinary
share indirectly through Star NCLC Holdings Ltd., a Bermuda wholly-owned subsidiary.

In December 2015, we repurchased 348,553 ordinary shares
under NCLH’s repurchase program as a part of a Secondary Equity

F-



Offering by the Apollo Holders and Genting HK for approximately
$20.0 million.

In June 2012, we exercised our option with Genting
HK to purchase Norwegian Sky. We paid the total amount of $259.3 million to Genting HK in connection with the Norwegian Sky
Purchase Agreement as of December 31, 2016 and no further payments are due.

Fair Value Measurements
and Derivatives

Fair value is defined as the price at which an orderly
transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under
current market conditions (that is, an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds
the asset or owes the liability).

Fair Value Hierarchy

The following hierarchy for inputs used in measuring
fair value should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most
observable inputs be used when available:

Level 1

Quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement dates.

Level 2

Significant other observable
inputs that are used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources.

Level 3

Significant unobservable
inputs we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available.

Derivatives

We are exposed to market risk attributable to changes
in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of
our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives. We assess whether derivatives used in hedging
transactions are “highly effective” in offsetting changes in the cash flow of our hedged forecasted transactions. We
use regression analysis for this hedge relationship and high effectiveness is achieved when a statistically valid relationship
reflects a high degree of offset and correlation between the fair values of the derivative and the hedged forecasted transaction.
Cash flows from the derivatives are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying hedged transaction. The
determination of ineffectiveness is based on the amount of dollar offset between the cumulative change in fair value of the derivative
and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged transaction at the end of the reporting period. If it is determined that
a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, then
the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is released to earnings. In addition, the ineffective portion
of our highly effective hedges is recognized in earnings immediately and reported in other income (expense), net in our consolidated
statements of operations. There are no amounts

excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
and there are no credit-risk-related contingent features in our derivative agreements.

We monitor concentrations of credit risk associated
with financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business. Credit risk, including but not limited to counterparty
non-performance under derivatives is not considered significant, as we primarily conduct business with large, well-established
financial institutions that we have established relationships with and that have credit risks acceptable to us or the credit risk
is spread out among a large number of creditors. We do not anticipate non-performance by any of our significant counterparties.

at fair value and discloses the balance sheet location (in thousands):

The fair values of swap and forward contracts are determined
based on observable inputs and utilize the income valuation approach. These valuation models take into account the contract terms,
such as maturity and other inputs, such as foreign exchange rates and curves, fuel types, fuel curves and interest yield curves. The
Company determines the value of options and collars utilizing an option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available
in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets. The option pricing model used by the
Company is an industry standard model for valuing options and is used by the broker/dealer community. The inputs to this option
pricing model are the option strike price, underlying price, risk-free rate of interest, time to expiration, and volatility. The
fair value of option contracts considers both the intrinsic value and any remaining time value associated with those derivatives
that have not yet settled. The Company also considers counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk in its determination of
all estimated fair values. Our derivatives and financial instruments were categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, and
we had no derivatives or financial instruments categorized as Level 1 or Level 3.

Our derivative contracts include rights of offset with
our counterparties. We have elected to net certain assets and liabilities within counterparties when the rights of offset exist.
We are not required to post cash collateral related to our derivative instruments.

Long-Term Debt

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value
of our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $6,448.6 million and $6,525.7 million, respectively, which was $23.5
million higher and $11.6 million higher, respectively, than the carrying values. The difference between the fair value and carrying
value of our long-term debt is due to our fixed and variable rate debt obligations carrying interest rates that are above or below
market rates at the measurement dates. The fair value of our long-term debt was calculated based on estimated rates for the same
or similar instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities resulting in Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Market
risk associated with our long-term variable rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest
rates. The calculation of the fair value of our long-term debt is considered a Level 2 input.

Non-recurring Measurements of Non-financial
Assets

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets, principally
tradenames, are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would
indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable.

We believe our estimates and judgments with respect
to our long-lived assets, principally ships, and goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable. Nonetheless,
if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in
the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets, we could be required to record an impairment charge. We estimate fair
value based on the best information available utilizing estimates, judgments and projections as necessary. As of December 31,
2017, our annual review supports the carrying value of these assets.

Employee Benefits and Share-Based Compensation

Share-Based Compensation

As a result of NCLH’s adoption of ASU No. 2016-09,
beginning in the first quarter of 2017, NCLH began accounting for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating expected forfeitures.
Pursuant to the modified-retrospective application, the net cumulative effect of this change was recognized as a $2.2 million increase
to retained earnings as of January 1, 2017 (we refer you to our consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity).

Amended and Restated 2013 Performance Incentive Plan
(“Restated 2013 Plan”)

In January 2013, NCLH adopted the 2013 Performance Incentive
Plan which provided for the issuance of up to 15,035,106 of NCLH’s ordinary shares pursuant to awards granted under the plan,
with no more than 5,000,000 shares being granted to one individual in any calendar year. In May 2016, the plan was amended and
restated pursuant to approval from the Board of Directors and NCLH’s shareholders. Among other things, under the Restated
2013 Plan, the number of NCLH’s ordinary shares that may be delivered pursuant to all awards granted under the plan was increased
by an additional 12,430,000 shares to a new maximum aggregate limit of 27,465,106 shares. Additionally, the expiration date of
the Restated 2013 Plan was extended to March 30, 2026. Share options under the plan are granted with an exercise price equal to
the closing market price of NCLH shares at the date of grant. The vesting period for time-based options is typically set at 3,
4 or 5 years with a contractual life ranging from 7 to 10 years. The vesting period for time-based restricted share units is generally
3 years. Forfeited awards will be available for subsequent awards under the Restated 2013 Plan.

F-



Share Option Awards

No share option awards were granted in 2017. The fair
value of each time-based option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The estimated
fair value of the share options, less estimated forfeitures, is amortized over the vesting period using the straight-line vesting
method. The assumptions used within the option-pricing model for the time-based awards are as follows:



Dividend yield

—%

—%

Expected share price volatility

30.36%-33.01%

32.32%-45.33%

Risk-free interest rate

1.20%-1.48%

1.34%-1.92%

Expected term

6.00 years

6.00-6.50 years

Expected volatility was determined based on the historical
share prices in our industry. The risk-free rate was based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the
expected option term at grant date. The expected term was calculated under the simplified method.

The performance-based options awarded to our President
and Chief Executive Officer in August 2015 are subject to performance conditions such that the number of awards that ultimately
vest depends on the adjusted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”) and adjusted return on invested capital (“Adjusted
ROIC”) achieved by the Company during the performance period compared to targets established at the award date. Because the
terms of the performance-based awards provide discretion to make certain adjustments to the performance calculation, the service
inception date of these awards precedes the grant date. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense beginning on the
service inception date and remeasures the fair value of the awards until a grant date is established. The estimate of the awards’
fair values will be fixed in the period in which the grant date occurs, and cumulative compensation expense will be adjusted based
on the fair values calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the grant date. The fair value for the option awards
for which a grant date has not been established is estimated on the last date of the reporting period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The estimated fair value of the share options is amortized over the requisite service period using the straight-line vesting
method. The assumptions used within the option-pricing model for the performance-based awards for which share-based compensation
expense was recognized during 2017, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

Expected volatility was determined based on the historical
share prices in our industry. The risk-free rate was based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the
expected option term at grant date. The expected term was calculated under the simplified method.

The fair value of the market-based share option awards
awarded to our President and Chief Executive Officer is estimated using a Monte-Carlo model which values financial instruments
whose value is dependent on share price by sampling random paths for share price. The key inputs for the simulation include current
share price, risk free rate, and share price volatility. For each simulated path, the model checks if the simulated share price
reaches the vesting threshold during the performance period. For each path that reaches the vesting threshold, the payoff upon
vesting is calculated. The fair value of the equity award is determined by averaging the expected payoff across all simulated paths
and discounting the average to the valuation date.

Monte-Carlo simulation:

As of December 31, 2017, there was $25 thousand
of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted ordinary share awards. The cost is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 1.0 year. Restricted shares, with the exception of those related to the Management Exchange Agreement
(which maintained their original vesting conditions of time and performance and have all vested or been forfeited as of December
31, 2017) vest in substantially equal quarterly installments over 1 or 2 years or in annual installments over 4 years. The total
fair value of shares vested during 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $0.1million, $1.1 million, and $40.9 million, respectively.

Restricted Share Units (“RSUs”)

On August 1, 2017, NCLH awarded a target number of 79,073
performance-based RSU’s to our President and Chief Executive Officer. The exact number of shares delivered in satisfaction
of the performance-based RSUs will be determined based on the achievement of certain pre-established performance targets. On March
1, 2017, NCLH awarded 1.7 million time-based RSUs to our employees which vest equally over three years. Additionally, on March
1, 2017, NCLH awarded 121,000 performance-based RSUs to certain members of our management team which vest upon the achievement
of certain pre-established performance targets.

The fair value of the time-based and performance-based
RSUs is equal to the closing market price of NCLH shares at the date of grant. The performance-based RSUs awarded to our President
and Chief Executive Officer are subject to performance conditions such that the number of awards that ultimately vest depends on
the Adjusted EPS and Adjusted ROIC achieved by

F-



the Company during the performance period compared to targets
established at the award date. Because the terms of the performance-based awards provide discretion to make certain adjustments
to the performance calculation, the service inception date of these awards precedes the grant date. Accordingly, the Company recognizes
share-based compensation expense beginning on the service inception date and remeasures the fair value of the awards until a grant
date occurs. The estimate of the awards’ fair value will be fixed in the period in which the grant date occurs, and cumulative
share-based compensation expense will be adjusted based on the fair value at the grant date.

The fair value of the market-based RSUs awarded to our
President and Chief Executive Officer is estimated using a Monte-Carlo model which values financial instruments whose value is
dependent on share price by sampling random paths for share price. The key inputs for the simulation include current share price,
risk free rate, and share price volatility. For each simulated path, the model checks if the simulated share price reaches the
vesting threshold during the performance period. For each path that reaches the vesting threshold, the payoff upon vesting is calculated.
The fair value of the equity grant is determined by averaging the expected payoff across all simulated paths and discounting the
average to the valuation date.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)

In April 2014, NCLH’s shareholders approved the
ESPP. The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to purchase NCLH’s ordinary shares at
a favorable price and upon favorable terms in consideration of the participating employees’ continued services. A maximum
of 2,000,000 of NCLH’s ordinary shares may be purchased under the ESPP. To be eligible to participate in an offering period,
on the grant date of that period, an individual must be customarily employed by the Company or a participating subsidiary for more
than twenty hours per week and for more than five months per calendar year. Participation in the ESPP is also subject to certain
limitations. The ESPP is considered to be compensatory based on: a) the 15% purchase price discount and b) the look-back purchase
price feature. Since the plan is compensatory, compensation expense must be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations
on a straight-line basis over the six-month withholding period. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a $1.5 million and $1.3
million liability, respectively, for payroll withholdings received.

The compensation expense recognized for share-based compensation
for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

Employee Benefit Plans

We offer annual incentive bonuses pursuant to our Restated
2013 Plan for our executive officers and other key employees. Bonuses under the plan become earned and payable based on the Company’s
performance during the applicable performance period and the individual’s continued employment. Company performance criteria
include the attainment of certain financial targets and other strategic objectives.

Certain employees are employed pursuant to agreements
that provide for severance payments. Severance is generally only payable upon an involuntary termination of the employment by us
without cause or a termination by the employee for good reason. Severance generally includes a series of cash payments based on
the employee’s base salary (and in some cases, bonus), and our payment of the employee’s continued medical benefits
for the applicable severance period.

We maintain a 401(k) Plan for our shoreside employees,
including our executive officers. Participants may contribute up to 100% of eligible compensation each pay period, subject to certain
limitations. We make matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 3% and 50% of amounts greater than 3% to and including 10%
of each participant’s contributions subject to certain limitations. In addition, we may make discretionary supplemental contributions
to the Plan, which shall be allocated pro rata to each eligible participant based on the compensation of the participant relevant
to the total compensation of all participants. Our matching contributions are vested according to a five-year schedule. The 401(k)
Plan is subject to the provisions of ERISA and is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
(the “Code”).

Our matching contributions are reduced by amounts forfeited
by those employees who leave the 401(k) Plan prior to vesting fully in the matching contributions. Forfeited contributions of $0.3
million, $0.1 million and $0.4 million were utilized in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

We maintained a Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan (“SERP”), which is a legacy unfunded defined contribution plan for certain executives who were employed by
the Company in an executive capacity prior to 2008. The SERP was frozen to future participation following that date. The SERP
provided for Company contributions on behalf of the participants to compensate them for the benefits that are limited under
the 401(k) Plan. We credited participants under the SERP for amounts that would have been contributed by us to the
Company’s previous Defined Contribution Retirement Plan and the former 401(k) Plan without regard to any limitations
imposed by the Code. Participants did not make any elective contributions under this plan. We have discontinued this plan
following the 2015 contributions and we paid the previously deferred contributions to participants in early 2017 following
the expiration of the required twelve month waiting period. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate balance of
participants’ deferred compensation accounts under the SERP Plan was $0.5 million.

We recorded combined total expenses related to the above
401(k) Plan and SERP of $7.3 million, $6.4 million and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

Effective January 2009, we implemented the Shipboard
Retirement Plan which computes benefits based on years of service, subject to eligibility requirements of the Shipboard Retirement
Plan. The Shipboard Retirement Plan is unfunded with no plan assets. The current portion of the projected benefit obligation of
$1.1 million and $1.2 million was included in accrued expenses and other liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively,
and $23.5 million and $21.4 million was included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
2017 and 2016, respectively. The amounts related to the Shipboard Retirement Plan were as follows (in thousands):

Income Taxes

We are incorporated in Bermuda. Under current Bermuda
law, we are not subject to tax on income and capital gains. We have received from the Minister of Finance under The Exempted Undertakings
Tax Protection Act 1966, as amended, an assurance that, in the event that Bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on profits,
income, any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance, then the imposition of
any such tax shall not be applicable to us or to any of our operations or shares, debentures or other obligations, until March 31,
2035.

We have U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $254.8
million and $256.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which begin to expire in 2023. We have
state net operating loss carryforwards of $8.9 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively,
which expire in the years 2025 through 2035. In 2016, based on the weight of available evidence, we reversed a valuation allowance
in the amount of $3.6 million with respect to the U.S. deferred tax assets of one of our U.S. subsidiaries.

Included above are deferred tax assets associated with
our operations in Norway for which we have provided a full valuation allowance. We have Norway net operating loss carryforwards
of $13.9 million and $22.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which can be carried forward indefinitely.

Included above are deferred tax assets associated with
our branch operations in the U.K. for which we have provided a full valuation allowance. We have U.K. net operating loss carryforwards
of $8.3 million and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which can be carried forward indefinitely.

Included above are deferred tax assets associated with
Prestige for which we have provided a full valuation allowance. We have U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $177.8 million
and $151.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which begin to expire in 2023. Section 382 of
the code may limit the amount of taxable income that can be offset by the Prestige NOL carryforwards.

The Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. Among other
provisions, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The SEC staff issued SAB No. 118, which addresses
how a company recognizes provisional amounts when a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed
(including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes in the Act. The measurement
period ends when a company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot
extend beyond one year. As of December 31, 2017, we have not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act;
however, as described below, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances. These amounts
are provisional and subject to change. The most significant impact of the Act for the Company was a $7.4 million reduction of the
value of net deferred tax liabilities (which represent future tax expenses) that was recorded as a discrete tax benefit as a result
of lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The tax benefit represents a provisional amount and the Company’s
current best estimate. Any adjustments recorded to the provisional amount through the end of 2018 will be included in income from
operations as an adjustment to tax expense. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Company’s
current interpretation of the Act and may change as the Company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance.
Other aspects of the Act are either not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total
amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):

During the year, $10.7 million of unrecognized tax
benefits were reversed due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. If the $0.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits
at December 31, 2017 were recognized, our effective tax rate would be minimally affected. We believe that there will not be a
significant increase or decrease to the tax positions within 12 months of the reporting date. We recognize interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction,
various U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. We are generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local,
or non-U.S. income tax examinations by authorities for years prior to 2014, except for years in which NOLs generated prior to 2014
are utilized.

Due to our international structure as well as the existence
of international tax treaties that exempt taxation on certain activities, the repatriation of earnings from our subsidiaries would
have no tax impact.

We derive our income from the international operation
of ships. We are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. and receive income from sources within the U.S. Under Section 883,
certain foreign corporations are exempt from U. S. federal income or branch profits tax on U.S.-source income derived from or incidental
to the international operation of ships. Applicable U.S. treasury regulations provide that a foreign corporation will qualify for
the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part: (i) the foreign country in which the corporation is organized grants an equivalent
exemption for income from the operation of ships of sufficiently broad scope to corporations organized in the U.S., and (ii) the
foreign corporation has one or more classes of stock that are “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities
market” in the U.S. or another qualifying country. We believe that we qualify for the benefits of Section 883 because we
are incorporated in qualifying countries and our ordinary shares are primarily and regularly traded on an established securities
market in the U.S.

Commitments and Contingencies

Operating Leases

Total expense under non-cancelable operating lease commitments,
primarily for offices, motor vehicles and office equipment was $17.0 million, $15.0 million and $12.6 million for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, minimum annual rentals for non-cancelable leases

Ship Construction Contracts

Project Leonardo will introduce an additional four ships
with expected delivery dates through 2025 and we have an option to introduce two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027,
subject to certain conditions. The four Leonardo ships are each approximately 140,000 Gross Tons with approximately 3,300 Berths.
We have an Explorer Class Ship, Seven Seas Splendor, on order for delivery in the winter of 2020. This ship is approximately 55,000
Gross Tons and 750 Berths. We have two Breakaway Plus Class Ships, Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Encore, on order for delivery
in the spring of 2018 and fall of 2019, respectively. These ships are approximately 168,000 Gross Tons each with approximately
4,000 Berths each. The combined contract price of the seven ships on order was approximately €5.5 billion, or $6.6 billion
based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange

F-



rate as of December 31, 2017. We have obtained export
credit financing for each of the ships which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship expected
to be delivered through 2025, subject to certain conditions. For ships expected to be delivered after 2023, the contract prices
are subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.

In connection with the contracts to build the ships,
we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellation to occur. However, if any such events were to occur, it could result
in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment losses which
may materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Other Commitments

The FMC requires evidence of financial responsibility
for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of U.S. ports to indemnify passengers in the event of non-performance
of the transportation. Accordingly, each of our three brands are required to maintain a $30.0 million third-party performance guarantee
in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations to passengers. The guarantee requirements
are subject to additional consumer price index-based adjustments. Also, each of our brands have a legal requirement to maintain
a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the U.K. As of December 31, 2017, approximately British Pound Sterling
11.8 million was in place as to support our security guarantees. We also are required by other jurisdictions to establish financial
responsibility to meet liability in the event of non-performance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions.

From time to time, various other regulatory and legislative
changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the U.S. and the cruise industry
in general.

Litigation

In the normal course of our business, various claims
and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us. Most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and, accordingly,
the maximum amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount.

Nonetheless, the ultimate outcome of these claims and
lawsuits that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time. We have evaluated our overall exposure with respect
to all of our threatened and pending litigation and, to the extent required, we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable
losses associated with our deemed exposure. We are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses beyond those
accrued, as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery.
However, based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that the aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses with
respect to these matters will be material to our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We intend
to vigorously defend our legal position on all claims and, to the extent necessary, seek recovery.

Other Income (Expense),
Net

Other income (expense), net was $10.4 million in 2017,
$8.3 million in 2016 and $46.7 million in 2015. In 2017, the expense

F-



was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses.
In 2016, the expense was primarily related to $16.1 million of unrealized and realized losses on fuel swap derivative hedge contracts
partially offset by $4.5 million of gains on foreign currency exchange and $3.9 million of gains on foreign currency exchange derivative
hedge contracts. In 2015, the expense was primarily related to $30.7 million of losses from the dedesignation of certain fuel swap
derivative hedge contracts and the ineffectiveness of settled fuel swaps in 2015. Also included in 2015 was an expense of $26.2
million related to the fair value adjustment of a foreign exchange collar which did not receive hedge accounting treatment partially
offset by $11.0 million of foreign currency transaction gains.

13.

Concentration Risk

We contract with a single vendor to provide many of our hotel and
restaurant services including both food and labor costs. We incurred expenses of $152.3 million, $137.2 million and $122.4 million
for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are recorded in payroll and related in our consolidated
statements of operations.

Supplemental Cash Flow
Information

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and
2015, we paid interest and related fees of $313.8 million, $303.2 million and $218.3 million, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had non-cash
investing activities for property and equipment of $20.0 million and non-cash investing activities in connection with capital leases
of $13.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had non-cash investing activities in connection with property and equipment
of $26.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had non-cash investing activities in connection with capital leases
of $31.1 million and non-cash investing activities for capital expenditures of $41.1 million. For the years ended December 31,
2017, 2016 and 2015, we paid income taxes of $11.7 million, $8.8 million and $10.3 million, respectively.

The seasonality of the North American cruise industry
generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. This predictable seasonality
in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due
to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled Dry-docks, which we typically scheduled during non-peak demand periods.

Subsequent Event

On January 30, 2018, the Company and Wendy A. Beck, the
Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, announced that Ms. Beck would be leaving the Company to pursue
other career opportunities. Ms. Beck has agreed to continue in her current position as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer through September 30, 2018 or any earlier date as may be determined by the Company (the “Succession Date”).

On February 2, 2018, a subsidiary of the Company entered
into a Transition, Release and Consulting Agreement (the “Transition Agreement”) with Ms. Beck. Pursuant to the terms
of the Transition Agreement, subject to Ms. Beck not voluntarily terminating her employment prior to the Succession Date, following
the Succession Date, Ms. Beck will be entitled to receive the following benefits: (i) an amount equal to two times her base salary,
which will be paid over a 12-month period, (ii) in recognition of her service and tenure, an amount equal to $4 million, paid in
quarterly installments through December 30, 2019, (iii) continued COBRA benefits at the same cost as active employees (or pay in
lieu of such benefits if the Company cannot provide such benefits) for up to 36 months, (iv) full acceleration of her outstanding
time-based equity awards, (v) continued opportunity to vest in her only outstanding performance-based equity award, subject to
the satisfaction of the applicable financial performance conditions for 2018, (vi) pro-rata portion of any bonus actually earned
based on performance for 2018, and (vii) an executive-level cruise.

Pursuant to the terms of the Transition Agreement, Ms.
Beck has agreed to provide consulting services to the Company for two years following the Succession Date to help with the transition
and integrate her successor. Ms. Beck will receive $2 million, paid in six equal quarterly installments through December 30, 2019,
for her consulting services.
