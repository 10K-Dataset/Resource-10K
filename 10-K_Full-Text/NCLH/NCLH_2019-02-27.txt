PART I

Item 1. Business

History and Development of the Company

Norwegian commenced operations from Miami in
1966, launching the modern cruise industry by offering weekly departures from Miami to the Caribbean. In February 2011, NCLH, a Bermuda
limited company, was formed with the issuance to the Sponsors of, in aggregate, 10,000 ordinary shares, with a par value of
$.001 per share. In January 2013, NCLH completed its IPO and the ordinary shares of NCLC, which were owned entirely by the
Sponsors, were exchanged for the ordinary shares of NCLH, and NCLH became the owner of 100% of the ordinary shares and parent
company of NCLC (the “Corporate Reorganization”). At the same time, NCLH contributed $460.0 million to NCLC
and the historical financial statements of NCLC became those of NCLH. The Corporate Reorganization was affected solely
for the purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure.

In November 2014, we completed the Acquisition of Prestige.
We believe that the combination of Norwegian and Prestige creates a cruise operating company with a rich product portfolio and
strong market presence.

The Sponsors have completed numerous Secondary Equity Offerings
of NCLH’s ordinary shares. As of December 2018, the Sponsors no longer own any NCLH ordinary shares.

Additional Information

NCLH is a Bermuda exempted company formed as a holding company
in 2011, with predecessors dating from 1966. Our registered offices are located at Walkers Corporate (Bermuda) Limited, Park Place,
3rd Floor, 55 Par-la-Ville Road, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. Our principal executive offices are located at 7665 Corporate Center

Our Company

Business Overview

We are a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian
Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. As of December 31, 2018, we had 26 ships with approximately
54,400 Berths. We plan to introduce 11 additional ships through 2027, subject to certain conditions.

Norwegian Encore is on order for delivery in the fall of 2019.
We have two Explorer Class Ships, Seven Seas Splendor and one additional ship, on order for delivery in the winter of 2020 and
fall of 2023, respectively. We have two Allura Class Ships on order for delivery in the winter of 2022 and spring of 2025. Project
Leonardo will introduce an additional six ships with expected delivery dates from 2022 through 2027. These additions to our fleet
will increase our total Berths to approximately 82,000.

Our brands offer itineraries to worldwide destinations including
Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Africa, Canada, Bermuda, Caribbean, Alaska and Hawaii. Norwegian’s U.S.-flagged
ship, Pride of America, provides the industry’s only entirely inter-island itinerary in Hawaii.

All of our brands offer an assortment of features, amenities
and activities, including a variety of accommodations, multiple dining venues, bars and lounges, spa, casino and retail shopping
areas and numerous entertainment choices. All brands also offer a selection of shore excursions at each port of call as well as
hotel packages for stays before or after a voyage.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that the following business strengths will enable
us to execute our strategy:

Rich Stateroom Mix

The Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent fleets offer an attractive
mix of staterooms, suites and villas. Norwegian’s accommodations include the groundbreaking Studio staterooms designed for
solo travelers centered around the Studio Lounge, a private lounge area solely for Studio guests, as well as ocean views, balconies,
and connecting accommodations to meet the needs of all types of cruisers. Norwegian’s suites range from two-bedroom family
suites to penthouses and owner suites, as well as three bedroom Garden Villas measuring up to 6,694 square feet. In addition, nine
of Norwegian’s ships offer The Haven, a key-card access enclave on the upper decks with luxurious suite accommodations, exclusive
amenities, and 24/7 butler and concierge service. The Haven suites surround a private courtyard with pool, hot tubs, sundeck, fitness
center and steam rooms. Onboard Norwegian Epic, the Breakaway Class Ships and the Breakaway Plus Class Ships, The Haven also includes
a private lounge and fine dining restaurant.

The spacious and elegant accommodations on Oceania Cruises’
six award-winning ships, the 684-Berth Regatta, Insignia, Sirena and Nautica, and the 1,250-Berth Marina and Riviera,
range from 143-square foot inside staterooms to opulent 2,030-square foot owner suites. The Regent fleet is comprised of four ships
— Seven Seas Voyager, Seven Seas Mariner and Seven Seas Explorer feature all-suite, all-balcony accommodations and a majority
of the accommodations on Seven Seas Navigator include balconies.

High-Quality Service

The Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent brands all offer a
high level of onboard service. We collaborate amongst the brands to provide an enhanced guest experience across all brands. Norwegian
offers guests the freedom and flexibility to design their ideal cruise vacation on their schedule with no set dining times, a variety
of entertainment options and no formal dress codes. Oceania Cruises and Regent are known for their quality of service, including
some of the highest crew-to-guest ratios in the industry and a staff trained to deliver personalized and attentive service.

Diverse Selection of Premium Itineraries

We have expanded our already broad range of premium itineraries.
Our fleet has a worldwide deployment, offering a few days to 180-day itineraries, including destinations in Scandinavia, Russia,
the Mediterranean, the Greek Isles, Alaska, Canada and New England, Asia, Tahiti and the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand,
Africa, India, South America, the Panama Canal, and the Caribbean. We introduced a new destination, Harvest Caye, in November 2016.
This destination in Southern Belize features Belize’s only cruise ship pier, expansive seven-acre white sand beach, 15,000
sq. ft. pool with swim up bar, multiple dining options and a nature center with wildlife experiences plus adventure tours.

Strong Cash Flow

We believe our business model will generate a significant amount
of cash flow with high revenue visibility. All three of our brands afford the ability to pre-sell tickets, receive customer deposits
and sell onboard activities in advance with long lead times ahead of sailing. In terms of newbuild capital expenditures, the cash
flow impact is mitigated as we have obtained export credit financing for the ships which is expected to fund approximately 80%
of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2027, subject to certain conditions.

Highly Experienced Management Team

Our senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive
experience in the cruise, travel, leisure and hospitality-related industries. See “Executive Officers” below.



Our Business Strategies

Driving Demand

We seek to attract vacationers to our products and services
in several ways, including:

·

delivering an enhanced, value-added vacation experience to our guests relative to other vacation alternatives;

·

creating diverse and unique itineraries in new and existing markets for our current and upcoming ships;

·

utilizing effective marketing and sales initiatives with a market-to-fill strategy; and

·

expanding internationally.

Our value-added-vacation product, itinerary diversification,
marketing and sales initiatives and international expansion strategies contribute to driving increased revenues for our fleet.
 Our market-to-fill strategy maintains pricing integrity by offering both the best price early in the booking cycle and value-added
promotions when necessary to mitigate the need to compromise on price.

Diversification of deployment is achieved by our destination
management team which reviews deployments across the fleet, either repositioning ships to new destinations or fine-tuning itineraries,
with the goal of creating product scarcity which, in turn, leads to higher pricing.

We also seek to increase demand through effective marketing
campaigns across various channels such as branding campaigns on nationwide television, robust and varied digital campaigns or targeted
mail campaigns aimed at supporting seasonal deployments. Our sales forces are also drivers of demand, particularly in terms of
educating travel agents on our products and services in order to better sell to potential vacationers.

Lastly, our international expansion efforts are aimed at increasing
brand awareness across the globe which allows us to diversify our guest sourcing.  We maintain numerous sales offices which
support sales and marketing efforts in various markets outside of North America including the United Kingdom, Europe, China, Australia,
New Zealand, Brazil, India, Japan and Singapore.

Leveraging Scale to Suppress Costs

We continue to leverage the combined purchasing power of our
three brands to reduce costs throughout the organization.  This initiative is bolstered by our Supply Chain and Logistics
Management function which supports our three brands as well as our corporate and international offices.

Enhanced Product Offerings and Guest Experience

Norwegian’s ships offer up to 28 dining options,
a diverse range of accommodations and what we believe is the widest array of entertainment at sea. Oceania
Cruises’ award-winning onboard dining, with multiple open seating dining venues, is a central highlight of its cruise
experience. Regent’s all-inclusive offering includes air transportation, shore excursions, pre-cruise hotel stays (for
concierge level and above), specialty restaurants, premium spirits and fine wines, gratuities, wi-fi and other amenities.

Maximize Revenue

We focus on growing revenue through various initiatives aimed
at increasing ticket prices and Occupancy Percentages as well as onboard spending to drive higher overall revenue. Our specific
initiatives include:

Strategic Relationships.

We have strategic
relationships with travel agencies and tour operators who commit to purchasing a certain level of inventory with long lead times.

Promotional Strategy.

With our Norwegian brand,
we utilize a more inclusive product offering on certain sailings and in certain cabin selections which provides guests a choice
of multiple amenities.

Casino Player Strategy.

We have non-exclusive
arrangements with over 100 casino partners worldwide whereby loyal gaming guests are offered cruise reward certificates redeemable
for cruises. Through property sponsored events and joint marketing programs, we have the opportunity to market cruises to these
guests. These arrangements with casino partners have the dual benefit of filling open inventory and reaching guests expected to
generate above average onboard revenue through the casino and other onboard spending.



Optimization of Deployment.

We manage our ships’
deployment to promote better breadth of itineraries and to offer sailings further in advance.

Ship Refurbishments.

We have invested in revitalizations
to our ships which provides a product which we believe delivers higher guest satisfaction and, in turn, higher pricing.

Measured Fleet Expansion

We have Norwegian Encore on order for delivery in the fall of
2019. This ship will be the largest in our fleet, reaching approximately 168,000 Gross Tons. With approximately 4,000 Berths, she
will be similar in design to Norwegian Bliss, which was delivered in April 2018, and will include additional innovative features.
Project Leonardo consists of six ships on order for the Norwegian brand with expected delivery dates through 2027, subject to certain
conditions. Each of the six Project Leonardo ships are approximately 140,000 Gross Tons and 3,300 Berths. For the Regent brand,
we have orders for two Explorer Class Ships, Seven Seas Splendor and an additional ship, to be delivered in 2020 and 2023, respectively.
Each of the Explorer Class Ships will be approximately 55,000 Gross Tons and 750 Berths. For the Oceania Cruises brand, we have
orders for two Allura Class Ships to be delivered in 2022 and 2025. Each of the Allura Class Ships will be approximately 67,000
Gross Tons and 1,200 Berths.

We believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding
the reach of our brands, positioning us for accelerated growth and providing an optimized return on invested capital. We have obtained
export credit financing which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered
through 2027, subject to certain conditions.

Expand and Strengthen Our Product Distribution Channels

As part of our growth strategy, we continually look for ways
to deepen and expand our sales channels. We continue to invest in our brands by enhancing websites and passenger services departments
through which travel agents and guests have the ability to book cruise vacations.

We focus on distribution through our three primary channels:
“Retail/Travel Agent,” “International,” and “Meetings, Incentives and Charters.”

Retail/Travel Agent.

The retail/travel agent
channel represents the majority of our ticket sales. Our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately
23,000 independent travel agencies including brick and mortar, internet-based and home-based operators located in North America,
South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. We have made substantial investments with improvements in booking technologies,
transparent pricing strategies, effective marketing tools, improved communication and cooperative marketing initiatives. We have
expanded sales teams who work closely with our travel agency partners on maximizing their marketing and sales effectiveness across
all three of our brands. Our focused account management is designed to create solutions catered to the individual retailer through
product and sales training. This education creates a deeper understanding of all our offerings.

International.

The international channel
represents an underpenetrated channel of distribution and one that we have increased focus on since 2015.  Focus on this market
accomplishes the dual objective of allowing us to grow our yields and capacity faster than if we only focused on the North American
market while also allowing us to diversify our risk.  As part of this focus, we have undertaken a three-pronged strategy of:

·

expanding the management, sales and marketing teams that oversee this area,

·

broadening our travel agency distribution to multiple partners in each region, and

·

expanding the geographic reach of our product by deploying our ships in areas that appeal to international guests and by personalizing our product for their tastes.

As part of this strategy, we have opened offices in
Sydney, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Tokyo, Auckland and Singapore and expanded or renovated our existing offices in Southampton,
Sao Paulo and Wiesbaden.

For information regarding risks associated with our
international operations, see Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor titled
“Conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks.”

Meetings, Incentives and Charters.

This channel
focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meetings and incentive travel. These sales often have very long lead times and
can fill a significant portion of the ship’s capacity, or even an entire sailing, in one transaction. The acquisition of
Sixthman in 2012, a company specializing in developing and delivering music-oriented charters, opened up a new market for travel
partners enabling travel partners to sell high-quality music experiences at sea to guests.



Itineraries

We offer cruise itineraries ranging from a few days to 180-days
calling on worldwide locations, including destinations in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, the Greek Isles, Alaska, Canada
and New England, Asia, Tahiti and the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, Africa, India, South America, the Panama Canal
and the Caribbean, including the Republic of Cuba. We have developed, and are continuing to develop, innovative itineraries to
position our ships in new and niche markets as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the world.

We believe that these destination-focused itineraries, complemented
by a comprehensive shore excursion program (which is included in the all-inclusive fare for cruises on the Regent ships), differentiate
our brands from many of our competitors. We call on varied destinations, many of which include overnight stays in port, allowing
guests to have more in-depth experiences than would otherwise be possible in only a single day port call.

For some of our longer itineraries, we strive to maximize profitability
by selling segments of the longer itineraries as shorter cruises (i.e., which last 7 to 20 days) in order to capture more time-constrained
customers. We believe the deployment flexibility created by the use of longer itineraries translates off-peak seasons into more
profitable portions of longer cruises.

Passenger Ticket Revenue

We offer our guests a wide variety of cruise fare options when
booking a cruise. Our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities,
as well as meals and entertainment. In some instances, cruise ticket prices include round-trip airfare to and from the port of
embarkation, complimentary beverages, unlimited shore excursions, free internet, pre-cruise hotel packages, and on some of the
exotic itineraries pre or post land packages. Prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary, stateroom category selected
and the time of year that the voyage takes place.

Onboard and Other Revenue

All three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional
products and services which are not included in the cruise fare, including casino operations, certain food and beverage, gift shop
purchases, spa services, photo services and other similar items. Food and beverage, casino operations and shore excursions are
generally managed directly by us while retail shops, spa services, art auctions and internet services may be managed through contracts
with third-party concessionaires. These contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage for the gross sales derived from these
concessions. Norwegian’s ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations, meals in certain dining facilities and many
onboard activities such as entertainment, pool-side activities, some internet services and various sports programs. Norwegian generates
additional revenue on our ships from casino operations, food and beverage, shore excursions, gift shop purchases, spa services,
photo services and other similar items. To maximize onboard revenue, Norwegian uses various cross-marketing and promotional tools
which are supported by point-of-sale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these products and
services. Oceania Cruises’ offerings may include air transportation and certain other amenities. Regent’s offerings
typically include air transportation, unlimited shore excursions, a pre-cruise hotel night stay (for concierge level and above),
premium wines and top shelf liquors, specialty restaurants, Wi-Fi and gratuities. Both Regent and Oceania Cruises generate additional
revenue from casino operations, gift shop purchases, premium shore excursions and spa services.

Onboard and other revenue accounted for 30%, 31% and 30% of
our consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Revenue Management Practices

Our revenue management function performs extensive analyses
in order to determine booking history and trends by sailing, stateroom category, travel partner, market segment, itinerary and
distribution channel in order to determine cruise ticket pricing. We concentrate on improving early booking occupancy rates to
drive higher Net Yields. We execute targeted and high-frequency marketing campaigns that communicate a message of a value-packed
cruise offering in both North American and select international markets. To increase the effectiveness of these targeted marketing
programs, we emphasize communication to keep the travel agents engaged and informed and utilize call centers focusing on both inbound
calls and outbound calls to high potential targeted customers. This marketing strategy assists in maximizing the revenue potential
from each customer contact generated by various marketing campaigns. We believe these strategies and other initiatives executed
by our distribution channels will drive sustainable growth in the number of guests carried and in Net Yields achieved.



Seasonality

Our revenue is seasonal and based on the demand for cruises.
Historically, the seasonality of the North American cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during
the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. This predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in
our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for
regularly scheduled Dry-docks, which we typically schedule during non-peak demand periods.

Competition

Our primary competition includes operators such as Carnival
Corporation and Carnival plc, which owns and operates Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises and Seabourn
Cruise Line, among others, and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which owns and operates Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises,
Azamara Club Cruises, and Silversea Cruises among others, as well as other cruise lines such as MSC Cruises, Crystal Cruises, and
Viking Ocean Cruises. In addition, we compete with land-based vacation alternatives, such as hotels and resorts, vacation ownership
properties, casinos, and tourist destinations throughout the world.

Sales of cruises and onboard offerings are subject to consumer
discretionary spending levels and may be influenced by geopolitical events and economic conditions.

Marketing Strategy

Our marketing teams work to enhance brand awareness and consideration
of our products and services among consumers and travel partners with the ultimate goal of driving sales. We utilize a multi-channel
strategy that may include a combination of print, television, radio, website/e-commerce, direct mail, social media, mobile and
e-mail campaigns, partnerships, customer loyalty initiatives, market research, and business-to-business events.

Building customer loyalty among our past guests is an important
element of our marketing strategy. We believe that attending to the needs and motivations of our past guests creates a cost-effective
means of attracting business, particularly to our new ships and itineraries, because past guests are familiar with our brands,
products and services and often return to cruise with us. We have shared customer databases across our brands to further enhance
our communications with our past guests who receive newsletters and mailings with informative destination and product information
and promotional amenities. Continued investments in our websites is also key not only to driving interest and bookings, but also
to ensuring the optimal pre-cruise planning experience offering guests the ability to shop, reserve and purchase a breadth of onboard
products and services. We have a strong communications stream that provides customized pre-cruise information to help guests maximize
their cruise experience as well as a series of communications to welcome them home and ultimately engage them in booking another
cruise.

Travel agents are crucial to our marketing and distribution
efforts. We provide robust marketing support and enhanced tools for our travel agent partners through a variety of programs. Our
travel partners can benefit from our online travel partner education programs that include a wide variety of courses about our
ships, itineraries and other best-selling practices. Agents can also easily customize a multitude of consumer marketing materials
for their use in promoting our products through our online platform.

Guest feedback is also a critically important element in the
development of our overall marketing and business strategies. We regularly initiate guest feedback studies among both travel partners
and consumers to assess the impact of various programs and/or to solicit information that helps shape future direction.

Ship Operations and Cruise Infrastructure

Ship Maintenance and Logistics

Sophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems
support the technical superiority and modern look of our fleet. In addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an
ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements, each of our ships is generally taken out of service, approximately
every 24 to 60 months, for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work, repairs and improvements performed in
Dry-dock. Dry-dock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under IMO requirements reflected in chapters of the International
Convention of the Safety of Life at Seas (“SOLAS”) and to some extent the International Load Lines Convention. Under
these regulations, it is required that a passenger ship Dry-dock once in five years (depending on age of vessel), twice in 5 years
(depending on flag state and age of vessel) and the maximum interval between each Dry-dock cannot exceed 3 years (depending age
of vessel and flag state). However, most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the Bahamas and/or
Marshall Islands (flag state), as applicable, after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to Dry-dock
once every 5 years. To the extent practical, each ship’s crew, catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the Dry-dock
period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work. Accordingly, Dry-dock work is typically performed during non-peak
demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service. Dry-docks are typically
scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability. We take this opportunity to upgrade the vessels in all areas
of both guest-facing services and innovative compliance technology.



Suppliers

Our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and
acquisition. Our largest operating expenditures are for payroll and related (including our contract with a third party who provides
certain crew services), fuel, food and beverage, advertising and marketing and travel agent services. Most of the supplies that
we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices. In addition, owing to the large quantities that we purchase,
we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies. Our purchases are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. Payment terms
granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry.

Crew and Staff

Best-in-class guest service levels are paramount in the markets
in which we operate, where travelers have discriminating tastes and high expectations for service quality. We have dedicated increasing
attention and resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests. Among other initiatives,
we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs, with a focus on career development. We believe that our dedication to anticipating
and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew,
helping to build customer loyalty.

We place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and
crew. We operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of SOLAS and International Management Code for the Safe
Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (“ISM Code”), the international safety standards which govern the cruise
industry. Every crew member is well trained in the Company’s stringent safety protocols, participating in regular safety
trainings, exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships.

Our captains are experienced seafarers. We further ensure that
our captains and watch standing officers regularly undergo rigorous training on navigation and bridge operations. To assist our
captains and officers while at sea, we have extensive navigation protocols in place. Our bridge operations are based on robust
navigational procedures and risk analysis. Our bridge teams follow pre-set voyage plans which are thoroughly reviewed and discussed
by the captain and bridge team prior to port departures and arrivals. In addition, all of our ships employ the latest state-of-the-art
navigational equipment and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have the most accurate data regarding the planned itinerary.

Prior to every cruise setting sail or upon departure, we hold
a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated. We also show an
extensive safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions. Our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control
and fire prevention and control systems. In recent years, our ships have continuously been upgraded and include internal and external
regulatory audits.

We have developed Safety Management Systems (“SMS”),
which establish policies, procedures, training, qualification, quality, compliance, audit and self-improvement standards for all
employees, both shipboard and shoreside. SMS also provides real-time reports and information to support the fleet and risk management
decisions. Through these systems, our senior managers, as well as ship management, can focus on consistent, high quality operation
of the fleet. Our SMS are approved and audited regularly by our classification society, Lloyds Register, and they also undergo
regular internal audits as well as annual/semiannual inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard, flag state and other port and state authorities.
We screen and train our crew to ensure crew familiarity and proficiency with the safety equipment onboard. Various safety measures
have been implemented on all of our ships and additional personnel have been appointed in our ship operations departments.

Insurance

We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships,
which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship. The coverage for each of the hull and machinery
policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the European and U.S. insurance markets.

In addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery
of our ships, we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels
to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business. The insurance we carry includes:

·

Protection and indemnity insurance (coverage for passenger, crew and third-party liabilities), including insurance against risk of pollution liabilities;



·

War risk insurance, including terrorist risk insurance. The terms of our war risk policies include provisions where underwriters can give seven days’ notice to the insured that the policies will be cancelled in the event of a change of risk which is typical for policies in the marine industry. Upon any proposed cancellation the insurer shall, before expiry of the seven day period, submit new terms; and

·

Insurance for our shoreside property, cybersecurity and general liability risks.

Our insurance coverage, including those noted above, is subject
to certain limitations, exclusions and deductible levels.

Trademarks and Tradenames

Under the Norwegian brand, we own a number of registered trademarks
relating to, among other things, the names “NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE” and “FEEL FREE,” the names of our ships
(except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending), incentive programs and specialty services rendered
on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “THE HAVEN BY NORWEGIAN.” In addition, we own registered trademarks
relating to the “FREESTYLE” family of names, including, “FREESTYLE CRUISING,” “FREESTYLE DINING”
and “FREESTYLE VACATION.” We believe that these trademarks are widely recognized throughout North America, Europe and
other areas of the world and have considerable value.

Under the Oceania Cruises brand, we own a number of registered
trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “OCEANIA CRUISES” and its logo, “REGATTA,” “INSIGNIA,”
and “YOUR WORLD. YOUR WAY.”

Under the Regent brand, we own registered trademarks relating
to, among other things, the names “SEVEN SEAS CRUISES” and “LUXURY GOES EXPLORING” as well as the names
of our ships (except where trademark applications have been filed and are pending).

We also claim common law rights in trademarks and tradenames
used in conjunction with our ships, incentive programs, customer loyalty program and specialty services rendered onboard our ships
for each of our brands.

The Regent ships have been operating under the Regent brand
since 2006. We entered into a trademark license agreement with Regent Hospitality Worldwide, Inc., which we amended in February 2011,
granting us the right to use the “Regent” brand family of marks. The amended trademark license agreement allows Regent
to use the Regent tradename, in conjunction with cruises, in perpetuity, subject to the terms and conditions in the agreement.

Regulatory Issues

Registration of Our Ships

Eighteen of the ships that we currently operate are registered
in the Bahamas. One of our ships, Pride of America, is a U.S.-flagged ship. Seven of our ships are registered in the Marshall Islands.
Our ships registered in the Bahamas and the Marshall Islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to Bahamian and Marshall
Islands requirements and are subject to International laws and regulations and to various U.S. federal regulatory agencies, including,
but not limited to, the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. Our U.S.-registered ship is subject to laws and regulations
of the U.S. federal government, including, but not limited to, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Coast
Guard and U.S. Department of Labor. The international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and other legal requirements
applicable to our operations change regularly, depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited.

Our ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities
in the various countries that they visit. Such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety, security,
environmental, customs, immigration, health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements.

Environmental Protection

Our ships are subject to various international, national, state
and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those that govern air emissions, waste discharge,
waste water management and disposal, and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals, solvents and paints. Under
such laws and regulations, we are prohibited from discharging certain materials, such as petrochemicals and plastics, into waterways,
and we must adhere to various water and air quality-related requirements.



With regard to air quality requirements, the International Maritime
Organization’s (“IMO”) convention entitled Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”) has set
a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 0.5% (reduced from the current 3.5% global limit) beginning January 2020. Various
compliance methods, such as the use of alternative fuels, or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur
emissions, may be utilized.

MARPOL also requires stricter limitations on sulfur emissions
within designated Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”), which include the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, North
American waters and the U.S. Caribbean Sea. Ships operating in these waters are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no
more than 0.1% or use approved alternative emission reduction methods. ECAs have also been established to limit emissions of oxides
of nitrogen from newly built ships. Additional ECAs may also be established in the future, with areas around Norway, Japan, and
the Mediterranean Sea being considered.

Ballast water discharges are governed by the MARPOL Ballast
Water Management Convention, which came into force in 2017 (“The Convention”), and which governs the discharge of ballast
water from ships. Ballast water, which is seawater held onboard ships and used for stabilization, may contain a variety of marine
species. The Convention is designed to regulate the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species
to new, different, or potentially unsuitable environments. Applicable vessels sailing in specific itineraries have also been upgraded
with ballast water treatment systems to further prevent the spread of invasive species.

MARPOL also sets forth requirements for discharges of garbage,
oil and sewage from ships, including regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of such discharges,
and the provision of port reception facilities for sewage handling. Ships are generally prohibited from discharging sewage into
the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land. Governments are required to ensure the provision of adequate reception
facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage, without causing delay to ships. Ships are generally required to
be equipped with either approved sewage treatment plants, disinfecting systems or sewage holding tanks.

Recently adopted amendments to MARPOL will make the Baltic Sea
a “Special Area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be prohibited. Stricter discharge restrictions will
be in effect for new passenger ships in 2019, and for existing passenger ships starting in 2021.

These requirements may impact our operations unless suitable
port waste facilities are available, or new technologies for onboard waste treatment are developed. Accordingly, the cost of complying
with these requirements is not determinable at this time.

In the U.S., the Clean Water Act of 1972, and other laws and
regulations, provide the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the U.S. Coast Guard with the authority to regulate
commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water, bilge water, gray water, anti-fouling paints and other substances
during normal operations while a vessel is in inland waters, within three nautical miles of land, and in designated federally-protected
waters. The U.S. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) program, authorized by the Clean Water Act,
was established to reduce pollution within U.S. territorial waters. For our affected ships, all of the NPDES requirements are set
forth in the EPA’s Vessel General Permit (“VGP”). The VGP establishes effluent limits for 26 specific discharge
streams incidental to the normal operation of a vessel. In addition to these discharge- and vessel-specific requirements, the VGP
includes requirements for inspections, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping.

The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, which implements certain
elements of MARPOL in the U.S., provides for potentially severe civil and criminal penalties related to ship-generated pollution
for incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles of land and, in some cases, within the 200-nautical mile Exclusive Economic
Zone (“EEZ”).

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) provides
for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200-nautical mile EEZ of the U.S., subject to defined
monetary limits. OPA 90 requires that in order for us to operate in U.S. waters, we must have Certificates of Financial Responsibility
(“COFR”) from the U.S. Coast Guard for each ship.  Our continued OPA 90 certification signifies our ability to
meet the requirements for related OPA 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance.

Many coastal U.S. states have also enacted environmental regulations
that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance.
These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law and, in some cases, the laws have no statutory limits of liability. Among
the most stringent requirements are those set by the State of Alaska, which has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges
in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards.
The legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in Alaskan waters.



The European Union (“EU”) has also adopted a substantial
and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at maintaining or improving the quality of the environment. To support the implementation
and enforcement of European environmental legislation, the EU has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement
as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections.

With regard to air emissions from seagoing ships, the EU requires
the use of low sulfur (less than 0.1%) marine gas oil in EU ports. Passenger ships on regular service to EU ports (and not operating
in an ECA) are required to use fuels containing a maximum sulfur content of 1.5%. The EU has set January 2020 as the compliance
date for the 0.5% fuel sulfur limit within their jurisdictional waters.

In addition to the existing legal requirements, we are committed
to helping to preserve the environment, because a clean, unspoiled environment is a key element that attracts guests to our ships.
Furthermore, NCL (Bahamas) Ltd. and NCL America LLC are certified under the International Organization for Standardization’s
14001 Standard. This voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental
management system which we have adopted for our operations. Currently we operate under an Environmental Management System that
is incorporated into the Company’s SMS, promoting environmental awareness both through our Sail & Sustain program and
annual Stewardship Report.

If we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws, regulations
or treaties, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other
expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws, regulations and treaties. Any fines or other sanctions for violation
or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, cash flow or financial condition.

Permits for Glacier Bay, Alaska

In connection with certain Alaska cruise operations, we
rely on concession permits from the U.S. National Park Service to operate our ships in Glacier Bay National Park and
Preserve. We currently hold a concession permit allowing for 22 calls per summer cruising season through September 30,
2019. Our renewal application for Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve was submitted in 2018. However, there can be no
assurance that such permit will be renewed when necessary or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permit will
remain unchanged in the future.

Passenger Well-Being

In the U.S., we must meet the U.S. Public Health Service’s
requirements, which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the Vessel Sanitation Program of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (“CDC”) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We rate at the top of the range
of CDC and FDA scores achieved by the major cruise lines. In addition, the cruise industry and the U.S. Public Health Service have
agreed on regulations for food, water and hygiene, aimed at proactively protecting the health of travelers and preventing illness
transmission to U.S. ports.

Security and Safety

The IMO has adopted safety standards as part of the SOLAS convention,
which apply to all of our ships. SOLAS establishes requirements for vessel design, structural features, construction methods and
materials, refurbishment standards, life-saving equipment, fire protection and detection, safe management and operation and security
in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew. All of our crew undergo regular security and safety training
exercises that meet all international and national maritime regulations.

SOLAS requires that all cruise ships are certified as having
safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for
Pollution Prevention (“ISM Code”). All of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ISM Code. Each such certificate
is granted for a five-year period and is subject to periodic verification.

The SOLAS requirements are amended and extended by the IMO from
time to time. For example, the International Port and Ship Facility Code (“ISPS Code”) was adopted by the IMO in December
2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments, port authorities and shipping
companies.

Amendments to SOLAS required that ships constructed in accordance
with pre-1974 SOLAS requirements install automatic sprinkler systems. IMO adopted an amendment to SOLAS which requires partial
bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of non-combustible construction. The SOLAS regulation implemented Long-Range Identification
and Tracking. All of our ships are in compliance with the requirements of SOLAS as amended and/or as applicable to the keel-laying
date.



In addition to the requirements of the ISPS Code, the U.S. Congress
enacted the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) which implements a number of security measures at
ports in the U.S. including measures that apply to ships registered outside the U.S. while docking at ports in the U.S. The U.S.
Coast Guard has published MTSA regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the U.S.,
provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification
of crew members on such ships. The Transportation Workers Identification Credential is a U.S. requirement for accessibility into
and onto U.S. ports and U.S.-flagged ships.

Maritime-Labor

In 2006, the International Labor Organization (“ILO”),
an agency of the United Nations that develops and oversees international labor standards, adopted a new Consolidated Maritime Labor
Convention (“MLC 2006”). MLC 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already
found in 68 maritime labor Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO since 1920. MLC 2006 includes a broad range of requirements,
such as a broader definition of a seafarer, minimum age of seafarers, medical certificates, recruitment practices, training, repatriation,
food, recreational facilities, health and welfare, hours of work and rest, accommodations, wages and entitlements. MLC 2006 added
requirements not previously in effect, in the areas of occupational safety and health. MLC 2006 became effective in certain countries
commencing August 2013. The Standard of Training Certification and Watch Keeping for Seafarers (“STCW”), as amended,
establishes minimum standards relating to training, certification and watch-keeping for our seafarers.

Financial Requirements

The Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”) requires
evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of U.S. ports to indemnify
passengers in the event of non-performance of the transportation. Accordingly, each of our three brands are required to maintain
a $30.0 million third-party performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations
to passengers. The guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price index-based adjustments. Also, our brands have
a legal requirement to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the U.K. As of December 31, 2018,
approximately British Pound Sterling 30.5 million was in place as a security guarantee. We also are required to establish financial
responsibility by other jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of non-performance of our obligations to passengers from those
jurisdictions.

From time to time, various other regulatory and
legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the U.S. and the
cruise industry in general.

For information regarding risks associated with our compliance
with legal and regulatory requirements, see Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk
factor titled “We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, which could
adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased
revenue.”

Taxation

U.S. Income Taxation

The following discussion is based upon current provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions, all
of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to
vary substantially from the consequences described below.

Exemption of International Shipping Income under Section
883 of the Code

Under Section 883 of the Code (“Section 883”) and
the related regulations, a foreign corporation will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation on its U.S.-source income derived
from the international operation of ships (“shipping income”) if: (a) it is organized in a qualified foreign country,
which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the U.S. in respect of each
category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883; and (b) either: (1) more than 50% of the value
of its stock is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified shareholders, which includes individuals who are “residents”
of a qualified foreign country; (2) one or more classes of its stock representing, in the aggregate, more than 50% of the combined
voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities
markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the U.S. (the “publicly traded test”); or (3) it is a “controlled
foreign corporation” (a “CFC”) for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50% of its stock is owned
by qualified U.S. persons for more than half of the taxable year (the “CFC test”). In addition, U.S. Treasury Regulations
require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting
requirements.



NCLH is incorporated in Bermuda, a qualified foreign country
which grants an equivalent exemption, and NCLH meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares were primarily and regularly
traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq”) until December 18, 2017, and since December 19, 2017, have been primarily
and regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Both the Nasdaq and the NYSE are considered to be established
securities markets in the U.S. Therefore, we believe that NCLH qualifies for the benefits of Section 883.

We believe and have taken the position that substantially all
of NCLH’s income, including the income of its ship-owning subsidiaries, is properly categorized as shipping income, and that
we do not have a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that the IRS interpretation of shipping income
could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify (or will not qualify) as shipping income.
Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under Section 883.
There are factual circumstances beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH’s ordinary
shares, which could cause NCLH or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under Section 883. Further, any changes
in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income, and we can give no assurances on this
matter.

Under certain circumstances, changes in the identity, residence
or holdings of NCLH’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause NCLH’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded
on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under Section 883. Therefore, as a precautionary matter,
NCLH has provided protections in its bye-laws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly traded
test by prohibiting any person from owning, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 4.9% of NCLH’s ordinary shares
unless such ownership is approved by NCLH’s Board of Directors (the “4.9% limit”). Any outstanding shares held
in excess of the 4.9% limit will be transferred to and held in a trust.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, Regent and its non-U.S.
subsidiaries are disregarded as entities separate from their immediate foreign parent (PCH) and Oceania Cruises was treated as
a corporation until December 31, 2017, and a disregarded entity as of January 1, 2018. For 2018, 2017 and 2016, both Regent and
Oceania Cruises relied on NCLH’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of Section 883 as
discussed above.

Taxation of International Shipping Income Where Section 883
of the Code is Inapplicable

Unless exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, a foreign corporation
is subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the U.S.
If we fail to qualify for the exemption under Section 883 in respect of our U.S.-sourced shipping income, or if the provision was
repealed, then we will be subject to taxation in the U.S. on such income.

Generally, “shipping income” is any income that
is derived from the use of vessels, from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time, voyage or Bareboat Charter basis or
from the performance of services directly related to those uses. For these purposes, shipping income attributable to transportation
that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the U.S., which we refer to as “U.S.- source shipping income,”
will be considered to be 50% derived from sources within the U.S.

If we do not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if
the provision was repealed, then any U.S.-sourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected
income would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxation on a net basis (generally at a 35% rate, 21% rate effective January
1, 2018) and state and local taxes, and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch
profits tax of 30%, unless a lower treaty rate applies (the “Net Tax Regime”). Our U.S. source shipping income is considered
effectively connected income if we have, or are considered to have, a fixed place of business in the U.S. involved in the earning
of U.S. source shipping income, and substantially all of our U.S. source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled
transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals
between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the U.S.

If we do not have a fixed place of business in the U.S. or substantially
all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation, the income will generally not be considered to be effectively
connected income. In that case, we would be subject to a special 4% tax on our U.S. source shipping income (the “4% Tax Regime”).

Other United States Taxation

U.S. Treasury Regulations list several items of income which
are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and, to the extent derived from U.S. sources, are subject
to U.S. federal income taxes under the Net Tax Regime discussed above. Income items considered non-incidental to the international
operation of ships include income from the sale of single-day cruises, shore excursions, air and other transportation, and pre-
and post-cruise land packages. We believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation
of ships is shipping income.



Income from U.S.-flagged Operation under the NCL America

Income derived from our U.S.-flagged operation generally will
be subject to U.S. corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels.  We expect that such income will not be subject
to U.S. branch profits tax nor a U.S. dividend withholding tax under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty.

U.K. Income Taxation

NCLH and NCLC are tax residents of the U.K. and are subject
to normal U.K. corporation tax.

U.S. Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels

Gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt
from tax under Section 883 provided NCLH qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 in respect of our shipping income.
If, however, our gain does not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if the provision was repealed, then such gain could
be subject to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Tax Regime.

Certain State, Local and Non-U.S. Tax Matters

We may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income
taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file
tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal
income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property, or operations
involving foreign property may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.

Changes in Tax Laws

The various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result
in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. For example, legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from
U.S. federal income tax under Section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the U.S. Moreover,
we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or
future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty on income
derived in respect of our U.S.-flagged operation.

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”)
was enacted, and among other provisions, reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Also in December 2017, the
SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 118, which addresses the recognition of provisional amounts
when a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail
to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes by the Act. The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared
and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year. The Company completed the
accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act. There was no material change to the $7.4 million reduction of the value
of net deferred tax liabilities (which represents future tax expenses) recorded in 2017 as a discrete tax benefit resulting from
the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the Act. Other aspects of the Act were either not applicable or did not
have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 3,200 employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 30,000 shipboard employees. Regent and Oceania Cruises’
ships also utilize a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant employees onboard. We refer you to “Risk Factors—Amendments
to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely
affect our financial results” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining
agreements that are currently in place.



Ports and Facilities

We own a private island in the Bahamas, Great Stirrup Cay,
which we utilize as a port-of-call on certain itineraries. We also operate a cruise destination in Belize, Harvest Caye,
which we introduced in November 2016. We have agreed to develop, in conjunction with PortMiami, a new terminal, which will be
our primary facility at the port. In addition, we have entered into various agreements relating to port or berthing rights
for our ships, which include the following:

·

an agreement with the Government of Bermuda whereby we are permitted weekly calls in Bermuda through 2022 from Boston and New York.

·

contracts for the Port of New Orleans, PortMiami, Port Canaveral, Manhattan Cruise Terminal, A.J. Juneau Dock, Ogden Point Cruise Ship Terminal in Victoria, BC, Puerto Costa Maya, Port of Roatan, Puerto Plata, and various Hawaiian ports pursuant to which we receive preferential Berths to the exclusion of other vessels for certain specified days of the week at the terminals.

·

a concession permit with the U.S. National Park Service whereby our ships are permitted to call on Glacier Bay during each summer cruise season through September 30, 2019.

·

an agreement with the British Virgin Islands Port Authority granting priority berthing rights for a 15-year term through April 2032 with options to extend the agreement for two additional five-year terms.

·

an agreement with the West Indian Company Limited granting priority berthing rights in St. Thomas for a 10-year term through September 2026 with an option to extend the agreement for an additional five years.

·

a

n agreement with the Port of Seattle for a 15-year lease through
    October 2030 with an option to extend the agreement for an additional five years where we have committed to a capital investment
    to develop the port for approximately $30 million and the port has committed to reimburse $15 million.

·

an agreement with the Huna Totem Corporation to develop
a second pier in Icy Strait Point, Alaska, which includes preferential berthing rights.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information contained in this annual
report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business. If any of the risks discussed
in this annual report actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The ordering of the risk factors set forth below
is not intended to reflect an indication of priority or likelihood. In connection with the forward-looking statements that appear
in this annual report, you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward–Looking Statements.”

Risks Related to the Company

Terrorist acts, armed conflict and threats thereof, acts
of piracy, and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises.

The threat or possibility of future terrorist acts, an outbreak
of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility or fear of such events, political unrest and instability, the issuance
of travel advisories or elevated national threat warnings by national governments, an increase in the activity of pirates, and
other geo-political uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises,
and consequently, the pricing for cruises. Decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely
affect our business by reducing our profitability.

Adverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss
caused by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters, including, but not limited to, oil spills and other environmental
mishaps, extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods and typhoons, fire, mechanical failure, collisions, human error,
war, terrorism, piracy, political action, civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events.
Any such event may result in loss of life or property, loss of revenue or increased costs. The operation of cruise ships also involves
the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port, including missing guests, inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard
crimes, which may bring into question passenger safety, may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation
against us. Although we place passenger safety as the highest priority in the design and operation of our fleet, we have experienced
accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the
future. It is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased
port-related and other costs resulting from such adverse events. Any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise
ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight.
An adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about
us. The expanded use of social media has increased the speed that negative publicity spreads and makes it more difficult to mitigate
reputational damage. Anything that damages our reputation (whether or not justified), including adverse publicity about passenger
safety, could have an adverse impact on demand, which could lead to price discounting and a reduction in our sales and could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If there is a significant accident, mechanical failure or similar
problem involving a ship, we may have to place a ship in an extended Dry-dock period for repairs. This could result in material
lost revenue and/or expenditures.

The adverse impact of general economic and related factors,
such as fluctuating or increasing levels of unemployment, underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices, declines in the securities
and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer
confidence. The demand for cruises is affected by international, national and local economic conditions.

The demand for cruises is affected by international, national
and local economic conditions. Adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in North America or globally, such as
the volatility of fuel prices, higher interest rates, stock and real estate market declines and/or volatility, more restrictive
credit markets, higher unemployment or underemployment rates, higher taxes, changes in governmental policies and political developments
impacting international trade including continued uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European
Union, trade disputes and increased tariffs, could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries
from which we source our guests. Consequently, this may negatively affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries, which
are a discretionary purchase. Decreases in demand for cruise vacations could result in price discounting, which, in turn, could
reduce the profitability of our business. In addition, these conditions could also impact our suppliers, which could result in
disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us.



Epidemics and viral outbreaks could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Public perception about the safety of travel and adverse publicity
related to passenger or crew illness, such as incidents of viral illnesses, stomach flu or other contagious diseases, may impact
demand for cruises and result in cruise cancellations and employee absenteeism. If any wide-ranging health scare should occur,
our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.

Breaches in data security or other disturbances to our
information technology and other networks could impair our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We have made significant investments in our information technology
systems to optimize booking procedures, enhance the marketing power of our websites and control costs. The integrity and reliability
of these systems and networks are crucial to our business operations and disruptions to these systems or networks could impair
our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand. In
addition, certain networks are dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty
of uninterrupted availability. Among other things, actual or threatened natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes,
fires, floods or similar events), information systems failures, computer viruses, denial of service attacks and other cyber-attacks
may cause disruptions to our information technology, telecommunications and other networks. While we have and continue to invest
in business continuity, disaster recovery, data restoration plans and data and information technology security, we cannot completely
insulate ourselves from disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results. We carry limited
business interruption insurance for certain shoreside operations, subject to limitations, exclusions and deductibles.

As part of our ordinary business operations, we and certain
of our third-party service providers collect, process, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information,
including email addresses, home addresses and financial data such as credit card information. The security of the systems and networks
where we and our service providers store this data is a critical element of our business. Despite our implementation of security
measures to protect against security breaches, unauthorized access to our data and other cyber-attacks or incidents, our systems
and networks are vulnerable to computer viruses, malware, worms, hackers and other security issues, including physical and electronic
break-ins, router disruption, sabotage or espionage, disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering (including through social
engineering such as phishing attacks), impersonation of authorized users and coordinated denial-of-service attacks. For example,
in October 2018, we discovered limited instances of unauthorized access to certain employee e-mail communications, some of which
contained proprietary business and personally identifiable information. We have implemented additional safeguards, and we do not
believe that we experienced any material losses related to this incident; however, there can be no assurance that this or any other
breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future. In addition, we may not
be in a position to promptly address security breaches, unauthorized access or other cyber-attacks or incidents or to implement
adequate preventative measures if we are unable to immediately detect such incidents. Our failure to successfully prevent, mitigate
or timely respond to any breach, attack or unauthorized use of our information systems to gain access to sensitive information,
corrupt data or create general disturbances in our operations systems could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our
reputation.

We are also subject to laws relating to privacy of personal
data, including European Union data privacy regulations. The compromise of our information systems resulting in the loss, disclosure,
misappropriation of or access to the personally identifiable information of our guests, prospective guests or employees could result
in governmental investigation, civil liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information,
any or all of which could disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect our business. Additionally, any material failure
by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry security requirements or to rectify a data
security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment.

In the event of a data security breach of our systems and/or
third-party systems or a cyber-attack or other cyber incident, we may incur costs associated with the following: response, notification,
forensics, regulatory investigations, public relations, consultants, credit identity monitoring, credit freezes, fraud alert, credit
identity restoration, credit card cancellation, credit card reissuance or replacement, data restoration, regulatory fines and penalties,
vendor fines and penalties, legal fees, damages and settlements. In addition, data security breaches, a cyber-attack or other cyber
incident may cause business interruption, information technology disruption, disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation
or litigation, digital asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data, loss of company assets, damage to our reputation, damages
to intangible property and other intangible damages, such as loss of consumer confidence, all of which could impair our operations
and have an adverse impact on our financial results.



Conducting business internationally may result in increased
costs and risks.

We operate our business internationally and plan to continue
to develop our international presence. Operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks, including political risks, risks
of increases in duties and taxes, risks relating to anti-bribery laws, as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising,
vacation or maritime businesses, or governing the operations of foreign-based companies may change. Additional risks include imposition
of trade barriers, withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and changes in and application
of foreign taxation structures, including value added taxes. If we are unable to address these risks adequately, our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Operating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes
conflicting legal and regulatory requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in
the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. We have implemented safeguards and policies
to prevent violations of various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments
and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards
and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct
prohibited by our policies, but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible. If our employees or agents violate our policies,
if we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we
fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil
sanctions and penalties.

We have operations in and source passengers from the U.K. and
other member countries of the European Union. On June 23, 2016, voters in the U.K. approved an advisory referendum to withdraw
from the European Union. Negotiations on the terms of the U.K.’s future relationship with the European Union are ongoing,
with the U.K. due to exit the European Union on March 29, 2019. While negotiations are continuing, there remains considerable uncertainty
around the withdrawal. Current discussions between the U.K. and the European Union may result in any number of outcomes including
an extension or delay of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union. The consequences for the economies of the U.K. and
other European Union member states as a result of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union are unknown and unpredictable,
which could make it more difficult to source passengers from these regions. The proposed withdrawal could also potentially adversely
affect tax, legal and regulatory regimes to which our business in the region is subject and disrupt the free movement of goods,
services and people between the U.K. and the European Union. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in fuel prices and/or other cruise operating costs
would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increased costs related
to fuel prices.

Fuel expense is a significant cost for our Company. Future increases
in the cost of fuel globally or regulatory requirements which require us to use more expensive types of fuel would increase the
cost of our cruise ship operations. For example, the IMO’s convention entitled Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL)
has set a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 0.5% (reduced from the current 3.5% global limit) beginning January 2020. Various
compliance methods, such as the use of low-sulfur fuels or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur
emissions, may be utilized. We have elected to install exhaust gas cleaning systems on some ships in our fleet, which will allow
us to continue to use high-sulfur fuel on those ships. However, if exhaust gas cleaning systems are not widely used in the industry,
low demand for high-sulfur fuel may increase the price for such fuel. Other ships in our fleet that do not have exhaust gas cleaning
systems will be required to use low-sulfur fuels. Low-sulfur fuels may be costly due to increased demand and scarcity if suppliers
are not able to produce sufficient quantities. In addition, we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to
market forces and economic or political instability resulting from increases or volatility in fuel expense. Despite any fuel hedges
we are currently a party to, or may enter into in the future, increases in fuel prices or other cruise operating costs could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to recover these increased
costs through price increases charged to our guests. Our hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs,
and any price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions, including choice of hedging instruments, breakdown of
correlation between hedging instrument and market price of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties. To the extent that we use
hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly, such
hedge contracts may limit our ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future. There can be no assurance that our
hedging arrangements will be cost-effective, will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that
our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedging arrangements. Additionally, deterioration in our financial condition
could negatively affect our ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future.



Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could
adversely affect our financial results.

We earn revenues, pay expenses, purchase and own assets and
incur liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar; most significantly a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated
in foreign currencies, particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, euro and Australian dollar. Because our consolidated financial
statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S.
dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against
our other major currencies may adversely affect our U.S. dollar financial results and will reduce the U.S. dollar amount received
upon conversion of these currencies into U.S. dollars.

We have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction
contracts denominated in euros or other foreign currencies. While we have entered into foreign currency derivatives to manage a
portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts, we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions
of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged. Additionally, if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related
ship construction contract, any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated.

Our expansion into and investments in new markets may
not be successful.

We believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our
passenger sourcing into major markets, such as Europe and Australia, as well as into emerging markets and to expand our itineraries
in new markets, as we did with Cuba, and we are in the process of such expansion efforts. Expansion into new markets requires significant
levels of investment and attention from management. There can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or
that we will have success in these markets, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business
into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Overcapacity in key markets or globally could adversely
affect our operating results.

We continue to expand our fleet through our newbuild program
and expect to add 11 additional ships to our fleet through 2027. Our competitors have also announced similar expansions to their
fleets. These increases in capacity in the cruise industry globally and potential overcapacity in certain key markets may cause
us to lower pricing, which would reduce profitability and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, older ships
in our fleet may not be as competitive as new ships enter the market and we may not be able to sell such older ships at optimal
prices.

Unavailability of ports of call may materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We believe that attractive port destinations are a major
reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation. The availability of ports, including the
specific port facility at which our guests will embark and disembark, is affected by a number of factors, including, but not
limited to, existing capacity constraints, security, safety and environmental concerns, adverse weather conditions and
natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, typhoons and earthquakes, financial limitations on port development, political
instability, exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors, local governmental regulations and fees,
local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists and
sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Treasury Department or other
regulatory bodies. For example, we had to temporarily change certain itineraries in the Caribbean due to damage some ports
sustained during an active hurricane season in 2017. There can be no assurance that our ports of call will not be similarly
affected in the future. We garner a pricing premium from our itineraries to Cuba as opposed to other Caribbean itineraries.
If there is a change in the diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Cuba, or either government issued sanctions or
regulations that affect travel to Cuba, it is possible that we will no longer include Cuba in our itineraries. Any
limitations on the availability of ports of call, including Cuba, or on the availability of shore excursions and other
service providers at such ports could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

There can be no assurance that our risks are fully insured against
or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance. Such losses, to the extent they are not adequately covered by
contractual remedies or insurance, could affect our financial results. In addition, we have been and continue to be subject to
calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on our own claim records, but also the claim records of all other members of the
protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability. Our payment of these calls
and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us. If we, or other members of our protection and indemnity associations,
were to sustain significant losses in the future, our ability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable
rates or at all could be materially adversely affected. For example, in the past our protection and indemnity associations have
increased certain deductibles and determined not to cover certain categories of claims. Moreover, irrespective of the occurrence
of such events, there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable
rates or at all.



Evolving requirements and regulations regarding data privacy
and protection and any actual or perceived compliance failures by us could increase our liability and costs and otherwise materially
adversely affect our business operations.

We process and store sensitive information relating to our guests,
employees, business partners and others and we are subject to requirements and regulations regarding data privacy and protection
in multiple jurisdictions. Government regulators, privacy advocates and individuals are increasingly scrutinizing how companies
collect, process, store, share and transmit personal data. New laws governing data privacy and protection, such as the European
Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) have been enacted and more are being considered worldwide.
The GDPR contains stringent data privacy and protection requirements and enables regulators to impose significant penalties for
non-compliance. The regulatory framework for data privacy and protection is uncertain for the foreseeable future, and it is possible
that legal and regulatory obligations may continue to increase and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent
or possibly conflicting from one jurisdiction to another.

Any actual or perceived failure by us or our business partners
to comply with posted privacy policies, federal, state or international data privacy and protection laws and regulations, or privacy
commitments contained in our contracts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and significant
fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and harm our reputation. Additionally,
if third parties we work with, such as vendors, violate applicable laws or regulations or our policies, such violations may also
result in increased liability for us and have an adverse effect on our business.

Existing and future legal and regulatory restrictions on our
ability to collect and use data could also negatively affect our ability to market our business, result in increased compliance
costs, and otherwise affect our business processes, all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.

Our indebtedness, and the agreements governing our indebtedness,
may limit our flexibility in operating our business and a significant portion of our assets, including many of our ships, are collateral
under our debt agreements.

A substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated
to the repayment of our indebtedness, which may limit our available funds for other business functions and strategic opportunities
and may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, the economy and the industry in which we operate. We may not be able
to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under
our indebtedness, including refinancing our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Any refinancing of our debt could be at
higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.

In addition, the agreements governing our indebtedness contain,
and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain, covenants that impose significant operating and financial
restrictions on us, including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional
debt or issue certain preference shares; pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital or make other restricted
payments, including the ability of NCLH’s subsidiaries, including NCLC, to pay dividends or make distributions to NCLH; repurchase
or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make certain investments or acquisitions; transfer, sell or create liens
on certain assets; and consolidate or merge with, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to other
companies. As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable
to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.

Our existing debt agreements also require us, and any instruments
governing future indebtedness of ours may require us, to maintain minimum level of liquidity, as well as limit our net funded debt-to-capital
ratio and maintain certain other financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond
our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios. A failure to comply with the covenants contained in
our debt agreements could result in an event of default under such agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of any default under our debt agreements, the holders of our indebtedness thereunder:

·

could elect to declare all indebtedness outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, if applicable; and/or

·

could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay such indebtedness.



Such actions by the holders of our indebtedness could cause
cross defaults under our other indebtedness, and there is no assurance that we would have sufficient current assets to repay such
indebtedness in full. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the
collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which includes a significant portion of our assets including many of our
ships. Any such action would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The impact of volatility and disruptions in the global
credit and financial markets may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks, including
those under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow additional
money on terms as favorable as our current debt, on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Economic downturns, including failures
of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis, can disrupt the capital and credit markets. Such disruptions could
cause counterparties under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress
payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them,
which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts
that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements. Also, we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts
due to our counterparties under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements. If we were
to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments, we would likely incur
significant costs to replace the counterparty. Any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in
additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument.

Certain of our debt agreements use LIBOR as a reference rate
for interest rate calculations. In July 2017, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that
it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate,
which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced.
At this time, we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to LIBOR
or the discontinuation of LIBOR. If LIBOR is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR,
we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our results of
operations.

Our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel
or the loss of key personnel may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our success is dependent upon our personnel and our ability
to recruit and retain high quality employees. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees in
order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth.  We need to hire and train a considerable number
of qualified crew members to staff the ships that will be joining our fleet in the coming years. This may require significant efforts
on the part of our management team, and our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified crew members would adversely affect
our business.

Our executive officers and other members of senior management
have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. The
unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us.

Delays in our shipbuilding program and ship repairs, maintenance
and refurbishments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The new construction, refurbishment, repair and maintenance
of our ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction,
refurbishment and repair projects. Our ships are subject to the risk of mechanical failure or accident, which we have occasionally
experienced and have had to repair. For example, in the past we have had to delay or cancel cruises due to mechanical issues on
our ships. There can be no assurance that we will not experience similar events in the future. If there is a mechanical failure
or accident in the future, we may be unable to procure spare parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense
or suspension of service, especially if a problem affects certain specialized maritime equipment, such as the radar, a pod propulsion
unit, the electrical/power management system, the steering gear or the gyro system.

In addition, availability, work stoppages, insolvency or financial
problems in the shipyards’ construction, refurbishment or repair of our ships, or other “force majeure” events
that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors, could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery,
refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships. Any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result
in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us, potential claims and impairment of losses. A significant
delay in the delivery of a new ship, or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have
an adverse effect on our business. The consolidation of the control of certain European cruise shipyards could result in higher
prices for the construction of new ships and refurbishments and could limit the availability of qualified shipyards to construct
new ships. Also, the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships
on a timely basis. These potential events and the associated losses, to the extent that they are not adequately covered by contractual
remedies or insurance, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.



We rely on third parties to provide hotel management services
for certain ships and certain other services, and we are exposed to risks facing such providers. In certain circumstances, we may
not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us.

We rely on external third parties to provide hotel management
services for certain ships and certain other services that are vital to our business. If these service providers suffer financial
hardship or are otherwise unable to continue providing such services, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such
service providers in a timely manner, which may cause an interruption in our operations. To the extent that we are able to replace
such service providers, we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services. Both the interruption of operations
and the replacement of the third-party service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and
results of operations.

We rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger
and crew connections. Increases in the price of, or major changes or reduction in, commercial airline services could undermine
our customer base or disrupt our operations.

A number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial
airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises. Increases in the price of airfare due to increases
in fuel prices, fuel surcharges, changes in commercial airline services as a result of strikes, weather or other events, or the
lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could adversely affect our ability to deliver
guests and crew to or from our ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which would, in turn, have an adverse effect
on our financial condition and results of operations.

Amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for
crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results.

Currently, we are a party to eight collective bargaining agreements.
Four of these agreements are in effect through 2020, two through 2021 and two through 2027. Any future amendments to such collective
bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative
impact on our financial condition. In addition, although our collective bargaining agreements have a no-strike provision, they
may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future. Any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect
on our financial results.

Litigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could
adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation.

Our business is subject to various U.S. and international laws
and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims
and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and/or lead to litigation or
legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. In certain circumstances,
it may not be economical to defend against such matters, and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter.
Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

As a result of any ship-related or other incidents, litigation
claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations, including, but not limited to, those arising from personal
injury, loss of life, loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected
coastal waters and the surrounding area, may be asserted or brought against various parties, including us and/or our cruise brands.
The time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims, actions and investigations. Subject to
applicable insurance coverage, we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims, actions and investigations and for
any judgments, fines, civil or criminal penalties if such claims, actions or investigations are adversely determined.

A failure to keep pace with developments in technology
could impair our operations or competitive position.

Our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems
and technology. These systems and technologies must be refined, updated and replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis
in order for us to meet our customers’ demands and expectations. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable
cost parameters, or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems, our business
could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology, such as fuel abatement
technologies, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results.



Our revenue is seasonal, owing to variations in passenger
fare rates and occupancy levels at different times of the year. We may not be able to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover
our expenses during certain periods of the year.

The demand for our cruises is seasonal, with the greatest demand
for cruises generally occurring during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. This seasonality in demand has resulted in
fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out
of service for Dry-docks, which we typically schedule during off-peak demand periods for such ships. Accordingly, seasonality in
demand and Dry-dock periods could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover the expenses we incur during
certain periods of the year.

Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment in Which We Operate

Future changes in applicable tax laws, or our inability
to take advantage of favorable tax regimes, could increase the amount of taxes we must pay.

We believe and have taken the position that our income that
is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental
to such income (“shipping income”), is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes under Section 883, based upon certain
assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “Item 1—Business—Taxation.”
The provisions of Section 883 are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.

We believe and have taken the position that substantially all
of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have
a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify
(or will not qualify) as shipping income. Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which NCLH
will satisfy complex stock ownership tests or the publicly traded test under Section 883 as described in “Item 1—Business—
Taxation—Exemption of International Shipping Income under Section 883 of the Code.” There are factual circumstances
beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH’s ordinary shares, which could cause us or
our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption. Finally, any changes in our operations could significantly increase
our exposure to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Regime (each as defined in “Item 1—Business—Taxation”),
and we can give no assurances on this matter.

If we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the
exemption under Section 883, our or such subsidiary’s U.S.-source income would be subject to either the Net Tax Regime or
the 4% Regime (each as defined in “Item 1— Business— Taxation). As of the date of this filing, we believe that
NCLH and its subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly traded test imposed under Section 883 and therefore believe that NCLH will
qualify for the exemption under Section 883. However, as discussed above, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that
could cause NCLH to not meet the stock ownership or publicly traded tests. Therefore, we can give no assurances on this matter.
We refer you to “Item 1—Business—Taxation.”

We may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income
taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file
tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal
income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations
involving foreign property that may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.

The various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result
in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. For example, legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from
U.S. federal income tax under Section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the U.S. Moreover,
we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or
future law, including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the U.S. – U.K. Income Tax Treaty
on income derived in respect of our U.S.–flagged operation.

We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including
environmental laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations
could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue.

Increasingly stringent and complex international, federal, state,
and local laws and regulations addressing environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations.
The IMO, a United Nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution
by ships, the Council of the European Union, individual countries, the United States, and individual states have implemented and
are considering, new laws and rules to manage cruise ship operations. Many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to international
treaties such as SOLAS, an international safety regulation, MARPOL, IMO’s requirements governing environmental protection,
and STCW, an IMO regulation governing ship manning. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Coast
Guard both have regulations addressing cruise ship operations.



The U.S. and various state and foreign government and regulatory
agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies aimed at reducing the threat of invasive species
in ballast water, requiring the use of low-sulfur fuels, increasing fuel efficiency requirements and further restricting emissions,
including those of green-house gases, and improving sewage and greywater-handling capabilities. Compliance with such laws and regulations
may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures which could adversely impact our operations
as well as our competitors’ operations.

Among the laws impacting cruise ship operations are a 2006 ballot
measure approved by Alaskan voters requiring that cruise ships meet Alaska Water Quality Standards (“WQS”). The law
was relaxed somewhat in 2013, allowing ship operators to apply for mixing zones in discharge permits, an option that has eased
compliance with certain WQS. The International Labor Organization’s Maritime Labor Convention, 2006 went into force on August
20, 2013. This Convention regulates many aspects of maritime crew labor and impacts the worldwide sourcing of new crew members.
MARPOL regulations have established special Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”) with stringent limitations on sulfur and
nitrogen oxide emissions from fuel burning aboard ships. Ships operating in designated ECAs (which include the Baltic Sea, the
North Sea/English Channel, and many of the waters within 200 nautical miles of the U.S. and Canadian coasts including the Hawaiian
Islands and waters surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) are generally expected to meet the new sulfur oxide emissions
limits through the use of low-sulfur fuels or installation of exhaust gas cleaning systems.

These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, areas
of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise
ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future. Some environmental groups continue to lobby for more
extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact.
By virtue of our operations in the U.S., the FMC requires us to maintain a third-party performance guarantee on our behalf in respect
of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations to guests. The FMC has proposed rules that would significantly
increase the amount of our required guarantees and accordingly our cost of compliance. There can be no assurance that such an increase
in the amount of our guarantees, if required, would be available to us. For additional discussion of the FMC’s proposed requirements,
we refer you to “Item 1—Business—Regulatory Issues.”

In 2007, the state of Alaska implemented taxes, some of which
were rolled back in 2010, which have impacted the cruise industry operating in Alaska. It is possible that other states, countries
or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically
applicable to the cruise industry and its employees and/or guests, which could increase our operating costs and/or could decrease
the demand for cruises.

Risks Related to NCLH’s Ordinary Shares

Shareholders of NCLH may have greater difficulties in
protecting their interests than shareholders of a U.S. corporation.

We are a Bermuda exempted company. The Companies Act 1981 of
Bermuda (the “Companies Act”), which applies to NCLH, differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to
U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Taken together with the provisions of NCLH’s bye-laws, some of these differences
may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of NCLH than you would have as a shareholder
of a U.S. corporation. This affects, among other things, the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director
are voidable, whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our Company,
what approvals are required for business combinations by our Company with a large shareholder or a wholly-owned subsidiary, what
rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the Companies Act or NCLH’s bye-laws, and the circumstances
under which we may indemnify our directors and officers.

NCLH does not currently pay dividends on its ordinary
shares.

NCLH does not currently pay dividends to its shareholders and
NCLH’s Board of Directors may never declare a dividend. Our existing debt agreements restrict, and any of our future debt
arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of NCLH’s subsidiaries, including NCLC, to pay distributions to
NCLH and NCLH’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. In addition, any determination to pay dividends in the
future will be entirely at the discretion of NCLH’s Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, cash
requirements, financial condition, business opportunities, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and
other factors that NCLH’s Board of Directors deems relevant. We are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends.
In addition, NCLH is a holding company and would depend upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to NCLH to
finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of NCLH. Investors seeking dividends should not purchase NCLH’s ordinary
shares.



Provisions in NCLH’s constitutional documents may
prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that NCLH’s shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.

NCLH’s bye-laws contain provisions that may delay, defer,
prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that its shareholders consider to be in their best interests. As a result,
these provisions may prevent NCLH’s shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of NCLH’s shares offered
by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect
the prevailing market price of NCLH’s shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. These provisions
include:

·

the ability of NCLH’s Board of Directors to designate one or more series of preference shares and issue preference shares without shareholder approval;

·

a classified board of directors;

·

the sole power of a majority of NCLH’s Board of Directors to fix the number of directors;

·

the power of NCLH’s Board of Directors to fill any vacancy on NCLH’s Board of Directors in most circumstances, including when such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise; and

·

advance notice requirements for nominating directors or introducing other business to be conducted at shareholder meetings.

Additionally, NCLH’s bye-laws contain provisions that
prevent third parties from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 4.9% of its outstanding shares without the consent of NCLH’s
Board of Directors and provide for the lapse of rights, and sale, of any shares acquired in excess of that limit. The effect of
these provisions may preclude third parties from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in NCLH in transactions that shareholders
might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

Not applicable.

Item 2. Properties

Information about our cruise ships may be found under “Item
1. Business—Our Fleet” and “Item. 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

NCLH’s principal executive offices are located in Miami,
Florida where we lease approximately 335,900 square feet of facilities. We also have a lease of approximately 77,500 square feet
for Prestige’s former executive offices in Miami, Florida which we have subleased to a third party. We lease approximately
(i) 31,200 square feet of office space over 2 locations in Sunrise, Florida for sales; (ii) 19,200 square feet of office space
in Southampton, England for sales, marketing, operations, and other administrative activity in the U.K. and Ireland; (iii) 12,200
square feet of office space in Wiesbaden, Germany for sales and marketing in Europe; (iv) 28,000 square feet of office space in
Phoenix, Arizona for a call center; (v) 17,600 square feet in Omaha, Nebraska for a call center; and (vi) 46,000 square feet of
warehouse space in Tampa, Florida for entertainment theatrical production.

Additionally, we lease a number of international offices throughout
Europe, Asia, South America and Australia to administer our brand operations globally. Norwegian owns a private island in the Bahamas,
Great Stirrup Cay, which we utilize as a port-of-call on some of our itineraries. We operate a cruise destination in Belize, Harvest
Caye.

We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current
needs, and that we are capable of obtaining additional facilities as necessary.



Item 3. Legal Proceedings

On September 21, 2018, a purported class-action lawsuit was
filed by Marta and Jerry Phillips and others against NCL Corporation Ltd. in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Florida relating to the marketing and sales of our Booksafe Travel Protection Plan. The plaintiffs purport to represent
an alleged class of passengers who purchased Booksafe Travel Protection Plans. The complaint alleges that the Company concealed
that it received proceeds on the sale of the travel insurance portion of the plan. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of
damages, fees and costs. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the claim and that any liability which may arise as a result
of this action will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In the normal course of our business, various claims and lawsuits
have been filed or are pending against us. Most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and, accordingly, the maximum
amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount.

Nonetheless, the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits
that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time. We have evaluated our overall exposure with respect to all
of our threatened and pending litigation and, to the extent required, we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable losses
associated with our deemed exposure. We are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses beyond those accrued,
as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery. However,
based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that the aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses with respect
to these matters will be material to our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We intend to vigorously
defend our legal position on all claims and, to the extent necessary, seek recovery.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures

None.



PART II

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,
Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Market Information

Since December 19, 2017, NCLH’s ordinary shares have been
listed on the NYSE under the symbol “NCLH.” Prior to December 19, 2017, NCLH’s ordinary shares were listed on
the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq Global Select Market) under the symbol “NCLH.”

Holders

As of February 15, 2019, there were 245 record holders of
NCLH’s ordinary shares. Since certain of NCLH’s ordinary shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf
of shareholders, the foregoing number is not representative of the number of beneficial owners.

Dividends

NCLH does not currently pay dividends to its shareholders. Any
determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results
of operations, financial condition, restrictions imposed by applicable law and our financing agreements and other factors that
our Board of Directors deems relevant.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer

On April 17, 2018, the Board of Directors of NCLH approved a
three-year share repurchase program under which NCLH may purchase up to $1.0 billion of its ordinary shares (the “Repurchase
Program”). Pursuant to the Repurchase Program, NCLH may repurchase its ordinary shares from time to time, in amounts, at
prices and at such times as it deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. Repurchases under the
Repurchase Program may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including structured and derivative
transactions such as accelerated share repurchase transactions and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan.

Share repurchase activity during the three months ended December
31, 2018 was as follows:

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Financial Presentation

The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures we make concerning
risks and other factors that may affect our business and operating results. You should read this information in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. See also “Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” immediately prior to Part I, Item 1 in this annual report.

We categorize revenue from our cruise and cruise-related activities
as either “passenger ticket” revenue or “onboard and other” revenue. Passenger ticket revenue and onboard
and other revenue vary according to product offering, the size of the ship in operation, the length of cruises operated and the
markets in which the ship operates. Our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises, which has historically been strongest
during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. Passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations,
meals in certain restaurants on the ship, certain onboard entertainment, and includes revenue for service charges and air and land
transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us. Onboard and other revenue primarily consists
of revenue from gaming, beverage sales, shore excursions, specialty dining, retail sales, spa services and photo services. Our
onboard revenue is derived from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires, from
which we receive a share of their revenue.

Our cruise operating expense is classified as follows:

·

Commissions, transportation and other primarily consists of direct costs associated with passenger ticket revenue. These costs include travel agent commissions, air and land transportation expenses, related credit card fees, certain port expenses and the costs associated with shore excursions and hotel accommodations included as part of the overall cruise purchase price.

·

Onboard and other primarily consists of direct costs incurred in connection with onboard and other revenue, including casino, beverage sales and shore excursions.

·

Payroll and related consists of the cost of wages and benefits for shipboard employees and costs of certain inventory items, including food, for a third party that provides crew and other hotel services for certain ships.

·

Fuel includes fuel costs, the impact of certain fuel hedges and fuel delivery costs.

·

Food consists of food costs for passengers and crew on certain ships.

·

Other consists of repairs and maintenance (including Dry-dock costs), ship insurance and other ship expenses.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented.
We rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make
these estimates and judgments. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We believe that the following critical
accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
These critical accounting policies, which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements,
relate to ship accounting, asset impairment and contingencies.

Ship Accounting

Ships represent our most significant assets, and we record them
at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of ships is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives
of primarily 30 years after a 15% reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship. Improvement costs that we believe add
value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives
or the remaining useful life of the ship. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred. We account for
Dry-dock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all Dry-dock costs as incurred.



We determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on
our estimates of the average useful life of the ships’ major component systems, such as cabins, main diesels, main electric,
superstructure and hull. In addition, we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions
and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. Given the large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates
related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently
uncertain. Should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual
values, depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher. If circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making
determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance
costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we reduced our estimated average 30-year ship
service life by one year, depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 would have increased by $13.3 million.
In addition, if our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for the same period would have increased
by $65.9 million. We believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied. We believe
that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit
from the ships’ usage.

Asset Impairment

We review our long-lived assets, principally ships, for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped
and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of
other groups of assets. We consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment
and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the
impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. We estimate fair value based on the best information
available utilizing estimates, judgments and projections as necessary. Our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting
expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk.

We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently
when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. For
our evaluation of goodwill we use the Step 0 Test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is
more likely than not (i.e., more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In order to
make this evaluation, we consider whether any of the following factors or conditions exist:

·

Changes in general macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions; limitations on accessing capital; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; or other developments in equity and credit markets;

·

Changes in industry and market conditions such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates; an increased competitive environment; a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (in both absolute terms and relative to peers); a change in the market for an entity’s products or services; or a regulatory or political development;

·

Changes in cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows;

·

Decline in overall financial performance (for both actual and expected performance);

·

Entity and reporting unit specific negative events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; litigation; or a change in the composition or carrying amount of net assets; and

·

Decline in share price (in both absolute terms and relative to peers).

We believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our long-lived
assets, principally ships, goodwill, tradenames and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable. Nonetheless, if there
was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions
or circumstances that influence such assets, we could be required to record an impairment charge. If a material change occurred,
we may conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill.
This is called the Step I Test which consists of a combined approach using the expected future cash flows and market multiples
to determine the fair value of the reporting units.

For our annual impairment evaluation, we performed a Step 0
Test for the Norwegian, Regent Seven Seas and Oceania Cruises reporting units. As of December 31, 2018, there was $523.0 million,
$462.1 million and $403.8 million of goodwill for the Oceania Cruises, Regent Seven Seas and Norwegian reporting units, respectively.
As of December 31, 2018, our annual review consisting of the Step 0 Test supports the carrying value of these assets.



Contingencies

Periodically, we assess potential liabilities related to any
lawsuits or claims brought against us or any asserted claims, including tax, legal and/or environmental matters. Although it is
typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if
it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable
estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the
amount of insurance recoveries, if any. In accordance with the guidance on accounting for contingencies, we accrue a liability
when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Although we believe that our estimates and
judgments are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance
recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimated provisions
or previous disclosures.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Net Revenue,
Adjusted Net Revenue, Net Yield, Adjusted Net Yield, Net Cruise Cost, Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel, Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS, to enable us to analyze our performance. See “Terms Used in this Annual Report”
for the definitions of these and other non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Net Revenue and Net Yield to manage our business
on a day-to-day basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the
revenue earned by us net of significant variable costs. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts
net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators
of our performance.

As our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment
of vessels outside of the U.S., a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly British
pound, Canadian dollar, euro and Australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting
currency, the U.S. dollar. In order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations, we calculate certain non-GAAP measures on
a Constant Currency basis, whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S.
dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures on both a reported
and Constant Currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business.

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as a supplemental
financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful
measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating
costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term
under GAAP nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income,
as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest
payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.

In addition, Adjusted Net Revenue and Adjusted Net Yield, which
exclude certain business combination accounting entries, are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful as supplemental
measures in evaluating the performance of our operating business and provide greater transparency into our results of operations.
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP
net income and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe
that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and
when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal
comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive
compensation. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly,
our presentation of Adjusted Net Revenue, Adjusted Net Yield, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS may not be indicative of future
adjustments or results. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred an impairment of $2.9 million related to
assets held for sale. A similar impairment was not incurred in the years ended December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2016. We included
this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income since this impairment amount was not representative of our day-to-day
operations and we have included similar non-representative adjustments in prior periods.



You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating
our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis.
In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments
in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures
in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial
measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures
to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “Results of Operations”
section.

Summary of Significant 2018 Events

In March 2018, we repurchased approximately $263.5 million
of NCLH’s outstanding ordinary shares under our previously authorized three-year, $500.0 million share repurchase
program, exhausting the remaining authorization under the program. In April 2018, the Board of Directors of NCLH approved a
new three-year share repurchase program under which NCLH may purchase up to $1.0 billion of its ordinary shares. We
repurchased approximately $401.3 million of NCLH’s ordinary shares under the Repurchase Program.

In April 2018, Norwegian Bliss was delivered.

In April 2018, we redeemed $135.0 million
principal amount of the $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.75% Senior Notes due 2021.

As of December 31, 2018, the Sponsors no longer own any NCLH
ordinary shares.

Executive Overview

Total revenue increased 12.2% to $6.1 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2018 compared to $5.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross Yield increased 3.4%. Net Revenue
for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 12.6% to $4.7 billion from $4.2 billion in the same period in 2017 with an
improvement in Net Yield of 3.7% and an increase in Capacity Days of 8.5%.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net income and
diluted EPS of $954.8 million and $4.25, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had net income and diluted EPS
of $759.9 million and $3.31, respectively. Operating income increased 16.2% to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31,
2018 from $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017.

We had Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS of $1.1 billion
and $4.92, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018, including $150.1 million of adjustments primarily consisting of
expenses related to non-cash share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, losses on the extinguishment
of debt and certain other adjustments, compared to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS of $907.7 million and $3.96, respectively,
for the year ended December 31, 2017. A 14.5% improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was achieved for the same period, primarily due to
the increase in net income and EBITDA. We refer you to our “Results of Operations” below for a calculation of Net Revenue,
Net Yield, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 (“2018”) Compared
to Year Ended December 31, 2017 (“2017”)

Revenue

Total revenue increased 12.2% to $6.1 billion in 2018 compared
to $5.4 billion in 2017 primarily due to an increase in Capacity Days and improved pricing. Gross Yield increased 3.4%. Net Revenue
increased 12.6% to $4.7 billion in 2018, from $4.2 billion in 2017, due to an increase in Capacity Days of 8.5% and an increase
in Net Yield of 3.7%.  The increase in Capacity Days was primarily due to Norwegian Joy and Norwegian Bliss joining our fleet
in the second quarter of 2017 and 2018, respectively. The increase in Gross Yield and Net Yield was primarily due to an increase
in passenger ticket revenue and Occupancy Percentage.  On a Constant Currency basis, Net Yield increased 3.5%.

Expense

Total cruise operating expense increased 10.2% in
2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the increase in Capacity Days. Gross Cruise Cost increased 11.4% in 2018 compared to
2017, due to higher total cruise operating expense and, to a lesser extent, higher marketing, general and administrative
expenses. Total other operating expense increased 13.7% in 2018 compared to 2017. Marketing, general and administrative
expenses increased primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and higher advertising expenses. Depreciation
and amortization expense increased primarily due to the additions of Norwegian Joy and Norwegian Bliss and ship
improvement projects. Net Cruise Cost per Capacity Day increased 2.8% (2.5% on a Constant Currency basis) due to higher
marketing, general and administrative expenses, higher commissions and transportation fees, and, to a lesser extent, higher
maintenance and repairs, including fuel and Dry-dock expenses. Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day
increased 2.9% (2.6% on a Constant Currency basis). We refer you to the “Results of Operations” above for a
reconciliation of total cruise operating expense to Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel.



Interest expense, net was $270.4 million in 2018 compared to
$267.8 million in 2017. The increase in interest expense primarily reflects additional debt incurred in connection with the delivery
of Norwegian Joy and Norwegian Bliss in the second quarter of 2017 and 2018, respectively, Project Leonardo financing, and higher
interest rates due to an increase in LIBOR. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by the benefit from the October
2017 full redemption of our 4.625% Senior Notes due 2020 and the benefit from the April 2018 partial $135.0 million redemption
of our 4.75% Senior Notes due 2021. 2018 included $6.3 million of redemption premium and write-off of fees in connection with the
partial redemption. 2017 included losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of $23.9 million.

Other income (expense), net was income of $20.7 million in 2018
compared to expense of $10.4 million in 2017. Other income in 2018 was primarily due to gains on foreign currency exchange. 
Other expense in 2017 was primarily due to losses on foreign currency exchange.

Income tax expense was $14.5 million in 2018 compared to $10.7
million in 2017. The expense in 2017 had benefits of $7.7 million from the impact on our net deferred tax liabilities of a change
in both U.S. and U.K. tax rates due to tax reform and a reversal of prior years’ contingency reserves of $11.6 million.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 (“2017”) Compared
to Year Ended December 31, 2016 (“2016”)

Revenue

Total revenue increased 10.7% to $5.4 billion in 2017 compared
to $4.9 billion in 2016 primarily due to an increase in Capacity Days and improved pricing. Gross Yield increased 4.4%. Net Revenue
in 2017 increased 11.2% to $4.2 billion from $3.8 billion in 2016 due to an increase in Capacity Days of 6.0% and an increase in
Net Yield of 4.9%. The increase in Capacity Days was primarily due to the delivery of Norwegian Joy in April 2017, the delivery
of Seven Seas Explorer in June 2016 and Sirena joining our fleet in April 2016. The increase in Net Yield was primarily due to
improved pricing. Adjusted Net Revenue includes a deferred revenue fair value adjustment of $1.0 million in 2016 related to the
Acquisition of Prestige. On a Constant Currency basis, Net Yield and Adjusted Net Yield increased 5.1% and 5.0%, respectively,
in 2017 compared to 2016.

Expense

Total cruise operating expense increased 7.5% in 2017 compared
to 2016 primarily due to the increase in Capacity Days as discussed above and an increase in marketing, general and administrative
expenses. Gross Cruise Cost increased 9.1% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to an increase in marketing, general and administrative
expenses and total cruise operating expense. Total other operating expense increased 16.8% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due
to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and marketing, general and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization
expense increased primarily due to the ship additions and ship improvement projects. The increase in marketing, general and administrative
expense was primarily due to pay for performance incentive expenses. On a Capacity Day basis, Net Cruise Cost increased 2.9% on
an actual and a Constant Currency basis, due to the increases in expenses discussed above. Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel
per Capacity Day increased 2.9% primarily due to the expenses discussed above (2.8% on a Constant Currency basis). We refer you
to the “Results of Operations” above for a reconciliation of total cruise operating expense to Adjusted Net Cruise
Cost Excluding Fuel.

Interest expense, net was $267.8 million in 2017 compared to
$276.9 million in 2016.  Interest expense for 2017 reflects higher interest rates due to an increase in LIBOR, as well as
an increase in average debt balances outstanding primarily associated with the delivery of new ships and newbuild installments. 
In connection with the redemption of senior notes and refinancing of certain of our credit facilities, interest expense, net included
losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of $23.9 million in 2017 and $39.2 million in 2016.

Other income (expense), net was an expense of $10.4 million
in 2017 compared to an expense of $8.3 million in 2016. In 2017, the expense was primarily related to losses on foreign currency
exchange. In 2016, the expense was primarily related to $16.1 million of unrealized and realized losses on fuel swap derivative
hedge contracts partially offset by $4.5 million of gains on foreign currency exchange and $3.9 million of gains on foreign currency
exchange derivative hedge contracts.

In 2017, we had an income tax expense of $10.7 million compared
to $7.2 million in 2016. The expense in 2017 had benefits of $7.7 million from the impact on our net deferred tax liabilities of
a change in both U.S. and U.K. tax rates due to tax reform and a reversal of prior years’ contingency reserves of $11.6 million.
The expense in 2016 had a benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance of $3.6 million.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

As of December 31, 2018, our liquidity was $908.9 million
consisting of $163.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $745.0 million available under our Revolving Loan Facility. Our primary
ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital, capital expenditures and debt service.

As of December 31, 2018, we had a working capital deficit
of $2.6 billion. This deficit included $1.6 billion of advance ticket sales, which represents the total revenue we collect in advance
of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities.
Our business model, along with our Revolving Loan Facility, allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet
our operating, investing and financing needs.

We evaluate potential sources of additional liquidity, including
the capital markets, in the ordinary course of business. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure,
taking into consideration our current and expected capital requirements, our assessment of prevailing market conditions and expectations
regarding future conditions, and the contractual and other restrictions to which we are subject.

Our existing debt agreements restrict, and any of our future
debt arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions and/or to pay dividends
to NCLC and NCLH’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. NCLH is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries
for their ability to pay distributions to NCLH to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of NCLH. However, we do not
believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations.

In January 2019, we (a) reduced the pricing of our existing
$875.0 million Revolving Loan Facility, (b) reduced the pricing and increased the approximately $1.3 billion principal amount outstanding
under the term loan A facility to $1.6 billion, and (c) extended the maturity dates for our Revolving Loan Facility and our term
loan A facility to 2024, subject to certain conditions. We used the proceeds from the increase in our term loan A facility to prepay
all of the then outstanding amounts under the term loan B facility.

Sources and Uses of Cash

In this section, references to 2018 refer to the year
ended December 31, 2018, references to 2017 refer to the year ended December 31, 2017 and references to 2016 refer to the year
ended December 31, 2016.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in
2018 compared to $1.6 billion in 2017 and $1.3 billion in 2016. The net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 included
net income of $954.8 million, an increase in advance ticket sales of $262.6 million and timing differences in cash receipts and
payments relating to various operating assets and liabilities. Without the adoption of Topic 606, advance ticket sales would have
increased by $250.6 million in 2018. We refer you to Note 3— “Revenue and Expense from Contracts with Customers”
in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of Topic 606. The change in net
cash provided by operating activities in 2017 includes net income of $759.9 million compared to net income of $633.1 million in
2016, as well as timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to various operating assets and liabilities, including
advance ticket sales of $154.0 million in 2017 and $135.0 million in 2016.

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion in 2018,
primarily related to payments for the delivery of Norwegian Bliss, ships under construction, ship improvement projects, and shoreside
projects. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.4 billion in 2017, primarily related to payments for the delivery of Norwegian
Joy, ship improvements, ships under construction and shoreside projects. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion
in 2016, primarily related to payments for the delivery of Seven Seas Explorer, ship improvements, ships under construction and
shoreside projects.

Net cash used in financing activities was $584.8 million in
2018, reflecting the net repayment of our Revolving Loan Facility, repayments on other loan facilities, the repurchase of NCLH’s
ordinary shares and deferred financing fees and other, partially offset by the proceeds from borrowings on newbuild loan facilities.
Net cash used in financing activities was $148.5 million in 2017, reflecting the repayment of our 4.625% senior unsecured notes,
our net repayment of our Revolving Loan Facility, repayments on other loan facilities and deferred financing fees and other, partially
offset by the proceeds from our Breakaway four loan facility. Net cash used in financing activities was $122.8 million in 2016,
reflecting the repayments of our 5.25% senior unsecured notes, net repayments of our then existing revolving loan facility, repayments
on other loan facilities, the repurchase of NLCH’s ordinary shares and deferred financing fees and other,
partially offset by issuance of our $700.0 million 4.750% senior unsecured notes.



Future Capital Commitments

Future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments,
including ship construction contracts, and future expected capital expenditures necessary for operations as well as our ship refurbishment
projects. As of December 31, 2018, anticipated capital expenditures were $1.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $0.7 billion for the years
ending December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We have export credit financing in place for the anticipated expenditures
related to ship construction contracts of $0.6 billion, $0.5 billion and $0.2 billion for the years ending December 31, 2019, 2020
and 2021, respectively. These future expected capital expenditures will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization
expense as we take delivery of the ships.

Project Leonardo will introduce an additional six ships, each
approximately 140,000 Gross Tons with approximately 3,300 Berths, with expected delivery dates from 2022 through 2027, subject
to certain conditions. We have a Breakaway Plus Class Ship, Norwegian Encore, with approximately 168,000 Gross Tons with 4,000
Berths, on order for delivery in the fall of 2019. For the Regent brand, we have orders for two Explorer Class Ships, Seven Seas
Splendor and an additional ship, to be delivered in 2020 and 2023, respectively. Each of the Explorer Class Ships will be approximately
55,000 Gross Tons and 750 Berths. For the Oceania Cruises brand, we have orders for two Allura Class Ships to be delivered in 2022
and 2025. Each of the Allura Class Ships will be approximately 67,000 Gross Tons and 1,200 Berths.

The combined contract prices of the 11 ships on order for delivery
was approximately €7.9 billion, or $9.1 billion based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2018. We have
obtained export credit financing which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship, subject to certain
conditions. We do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellations to occur. However, if any such events were to occur,
it could result in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment
losses which may materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2018,
2017 and 2016 was $30.4 million, $29.0 million and $33.7 million, respectively, primarily associated with the construction of our
newbuild ships.

Ship construction contracts are for our newbuild ships based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2018. Export credit financing is in place from syndicates of banks. The amount does not include the two Project Leonardo ships, one Explorer Class Ship and two Allura Class Ships which were still subject to financing and certain Italian government approvals as of December 31, 2018. We refer you to Note 17— “Subsequent Events” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for details regarding the financing for certain ships.

(6)

Other includes future commitments for service, maintenance and other Business Enhancement Capital Expenditure contracts.

(7)

Total excludes $0.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018, because an estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be reasonably determined.



Other

Certain service providers may require collateral in the normal
course of our business. The amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions.

As a routine part of our business, depending on market conditions,
exchange rates, pricing and our strategy for growth, we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building
of additional ships. We may also consider the sale of ships, potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these transactions
were to occur, they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness, through cash flows from operations,
or through the issuance of debt, equity or equity-related securities.

Funding Sources

Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that, among
other things, require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity, as well as limit our net funded debt-to-capital ratio, and maintain
certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends. Substantially all of our ships and other property and equipment
are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt. We believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2018.

In addition, our existing debt agreements restrict, and
any of our future debt arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of our subsidiaries, including NCLC, to
make distributions and/or pay dividends to NCLH and NCLH’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. NCLH is a
holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to  it to finance any dividend or
pay any other obligations of NCLH. However, we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an
impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations.

The impact of changes in world economies and especially the
global credit markets can create a challenging environment and may reduce future consumer demand for cruises and adversely affect
our counterparty credit risks. In the event this environment deteriorates, our business, financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely impacted.

We believe our cash on hand, expected future operating cash
inflows, additional available borrowings under our Revolving Loan Facility and our ability to issue debt securities or additional
equity securities, will be sufficient to fund operations, debt payment requirements, capital expenditures and maintain compliance
with covenants under our debt agreements over the next 12-month period. There is no assurance that cash flows from operations and
additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk

General

We are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal
operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives. The financial impacts of these derivative instruments are
primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching the notional,
term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or
other speculative purposes. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses.

Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2018, we had interest rate swap agreements
to manage our interest expense by hedging the interest rate risks associated with variable rates on our outstanding borrowings.
As of December 31, 2018, 72% of our debt was fixed and 28% was variable, which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps.
The notional amount of our outstanding debt associated with the interest rate swap agreements was $1.0 billion as of December 31,
2018. As of December 31, 2017, 54% of our debt was fixed and 46% was variable, which includes the effects of the interest rate
swaps. The notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate swap agreements was $218.6 million as of December
31, 2017. The change from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 was due to additional interest rate swaps executed and the repayment
of variable rate debt.

Based on our December 31, 2018 outstanding variable rate debt
balance, a one percentage point increase in annual LIBOR interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately
$18.4 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest.



Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2018, we had foreign currency derivatives
to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in
euros. These derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the payments on our ship construction contracts.
The payments not hedged aggregate €2.2 billion, or $2.5 billion based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December
31, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the payments not hedged aggregated €3.3 billion, or $4.0 billion, based on the euro/U.S.
dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2017. The change from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 was due to the delivery
of a ship in April 2018 and additional foreign exchange derivatives executed. We estimate that a 10% change in the euro as of December
31, 2018 would result in a $0.3 billion change in the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments.

Fuel Price Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates
to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships. Fuel expense, as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense, was 11.6%
for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 11.8% for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We use fuel derivative agreements
to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of December 31, 2018, we had hedged approximately 57%, 53%
and 33% of our 2019, 2020 and 2021 projected metric tons of fuel purchases, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had hedged
approximately 65%, 48% and 26% of our 2018, 2019 and 2020 projected metric tons of fuel purchases, respectively. The change in
fuel price risk from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 was due to additional fuel hedges executed.

We estimate that a 10% increase in our weighted-average fuel
price would increase our anticipated 2019 fuel expense by $40.5 million. This increase would be partially offset by an increase
in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of $20.1 million. Fair value of our derivative contracts is derived using valuation
models that utilize the income valuation approach. These valuation models take into account the contract terms such as maturity,
as well as other inputs such as fuel types, fuel curves, creditworthiness of the counterparty and the Company, as well as other
data points.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Our Consolidated Financial Statements and Quarterly Selected
Financial Data are included beginning on page F-1 of this report.

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants
on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.



Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of December 31, 2018. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness
of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding
of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance
of achieving their control objectives. Based upon management’s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018, to provide reasonable
assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that it is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO Framework”). Based
on this evaluation under the COSO Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2018.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report, which is included on page F-1.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met.
In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.
Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only the reasonable assurance that our controls will
succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions.

Item 9B. Other Information

None.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Norwegian Cruise
Line Holdings Ltd.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control
over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed
in the index appearing under Item 15(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also
have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017

,

and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The
Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included

in

Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect
to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1.

Description of Business
and Organization

We are a leading global cruise
company which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. As of December 31,
2018, we had 26 ships with approximately 54,400 Berths and had orders for eight additional ships to be delivered through
2027, subject to certain conditions. These eight orders consist of Norwegian Encore, a Breakaway Plus Class Ship, for
delivery in the fall of 2019; Seven Seas Splendor, an Explorer Class Ship, for delivery in the winter of 2020; and Project
Leonardo, which will introduce an additional six ships with expected delivery dates through 2027. We also plan to introduce
three additional ships (we refer you to Note 17— “Subsequent Events”). The addition of these 11 ships to
our fleet will increase our total Berths to approximately 82,000.

Norwegian commenced operations from Miami in 1966. In February
2011, NCLH, a Bermuda limited company, was formed with the issuance to the Sponsors of, in aggregate, 10,000 ordinary shares, with
a par value of $.001 per share. In January 2013, NCLH completed its IPO and the ordinary shares of NCLC, all of which were owned
by the Sponsors, were exchanged for the ordinary shares of NCLH, and NCLH became the owner of 100% of the ordinary shares and parent
company of NCLC (the “Corporate Reorganization”). At the same time, NCLH contributed $460.0 million to NCLC and the
historical financial statements of NCLC became those of NCLH. The Corporate Reorganization was affected solely for the purpose
of reorganizing our corporate structure.

In November 2014, we completed the Acquisition of Prestige.
We believe that the combination of Norwegian and Prestige creates a cruise operating company with a rich product portfolio and
strong market presence.

The Sponsors have completed numerous Secondary
Equity Offerings of NCLH’s ordinary shares. As of December 2018, the Sponsors no longer own any NCLH ordinary shares.

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

Our consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and contain all normal
recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. Estimates are required for the
preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and actual results
could differ from these estimates. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior periods have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-15,

Statement of Cash Flows
(Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,

to eliminate discrepancies in presenting and classifying
certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the update using
a retrospective transition method, which required an adjustment to cash flows from operating activities and financing activities
in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Cash payments for debt prepayment
or debt extinguishment costs, including third-party costs, other fees paid to lenders and premiums paid that are directly related
to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment, excluding accrued interest, are required to be classified as cash outflows from financing
activities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are stated at
cost and include cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less at acquisition and also include amounts
due from credit card processors.

Accounts Receivable, Net

Accounts receivable are shown net of an
allowance for doubtful accounts of $9.6 million and $5.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories mainly consist of provisions,
supplies and fuel and are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method of accounting.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred
except for those that result in tangible assets, including brochures, which are treated as prepaid expenses and charged to expense
as consumed. Advertising costs of $0.8 million and $2.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are included
in prepaid expenses and other assets. Expenses related to advertising costs totaled $327.3 million, $289.1 million and $270.5 million
for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing net income by the basic weighted-average number of shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is
computed by dividing net income by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.

A reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share
was as follows (in thousands, except share and per share data):

For the years ended December 31, 2018,
2017 and 2016, a total of 4.7 million, 5.6 million and 7.1 million shares, respectively, have been excluded from diluted weighted-average
shares outstanding because the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive.

Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment are recorded at
cost. Major renewals and improvements that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as a cost of the ship while costs
of repairs and maintenance, including Dry-dock costs, are charged to expense as incurred. During ship construction, certain interest
is capitalized as a cost of the ship. Gains or losses on the sale of property and equipment are recorded as a component of operating
income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, after a 15% reduction for the estimated residual values of ships as follows:

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment,
based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash
flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. We consider historical performance and future estimated
results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash
flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted
future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. We
estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates, judgments and projections as necessary. Our estimate
of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated
risk.

Goodwill and Tradenames

Goodwill represents the excess of cost
over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets, principally tradenames, are reviewed for
impairment on an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying
value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. We use the Step 0 Test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors
to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying value. For tradenames we also provide a qualitative assessment to determine if there is any indication of impairment.

In order to make this evaluation, we consider
the following circumstances as well as others:

·

Changes in general macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions; limitations on accessing capital; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; or other developments in equity and credit markets;

·

Changes in industry and market conditions such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates; an increased competitive environment; a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (in both absolute terms and relative to peers); a change in the market for an entity’s products or services; or a regulatory or political development;

·

Changes in cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows;

·

Decline in overall financial performance (for both actual and expected performance);

·

Entity and reporting unit specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; litigation; or a change in the composition or carrying amount of net assets; and

·

Decline in share price (in both absolute terms and relative to peers).

We have concluded that our business has
three reporting units. Each brand, Norwegian, Regent and Oceania Cruises, constitutes a business for which discrete financial information
is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment.

F-



For our annual impairment evaluation, we
performed a Step 0 Test for the Norwegian, Regent Seven Seas and Oceania Cruises reporting units. As of December 31, 2018, there
was $523.0 million, $462.1 million and $403.8 million of goodwill for the Oceania Cruises, Regent Seven Seas and Norwegian reporting
units, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, our annual review consisting of the Step 0 Test supports the carrying value
of these assets.

Revenue and Expense Recognition

Deposits on advance ticket sales are deferred
when received and are subsequently recognized as revenue ratably during the voyage sailing days as services are rendered over time
on the ship. Cancellation fees are recognized in passenger ticket revenue in the month of the cancellation. Goods and services
associated with onboard revenue are generally provided at a point in time and revenue is recognized when the performance obligation
is satisfied. A receivable is recognized for onboard goods and services rendered when the voyage is not completed before the end
of the period. All associated direct costs of a voyage are recognized as incurred in cruise operating expenses.

Disaggregation of Revenue

Revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors in various
geographical regions.

Revenues by destination consisted of the following (in thousands):

Segment Reporting

We have concluded that our business has
a single reportable segment. Each brand, Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent, constitutes a business for which discrete financial
information is available and management regularly reviews the brand level operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered
an operating segment. Our operating segments have similar economic and qualitative characteristics, including similar long-term
margins and similar products and services; therefore, we aggregate all of the operating segments into one reportable segment.

Although we sell cruises on an international
basis, our passenger ticket revenue is primarily attributed to U.S.-sourced guests who make reservations in the U.S. Revenue attributable
to U.S.-sourced guests was 77%, 77% and 81% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other individual
country’s revenues exceeded 10% in any of our last three years.

Substantially all of our long-lived assets
are located outside of the U.S. and consist primarily of our ships. We had 18 ships with Bahamas registry with a carrying value
of $9.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 17 ships with Bahamas registry with a carrying value of $8.0 billion as of December
31, 2017. We had seven ships with Marshall Island registry with a carrying value of $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
We also had one ship with U.S. registry with a carrying value of $0.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs related to a recognized
debt liability are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability,
consistent with debt discounts. For line of credit arrangements and for those debt facilities not fully drawn we defer and present
debt issuance costs as an asset. These deferred issuance costs are amortized over the life of the loan agreement. The amortization
of deferred financing fees is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of cash flows; however,
for purposes of the consolidated statements of operations it is included in interest expense, net.

F-



Foreign Currency

The majority of our transactions are settled
in U.S. dollars. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in other currencies are recognized in income at each balance
sheet date. We recognized (gains) losses of $(19.8) million, $14.2 million and $(4.5) million for the years ended December 31,
2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity

We enter into derivative contracts to reduce
our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices. The criteria used to determine
whether a transaction qualifies for hedge accounting treatment includes the correlation between fluctuations in the fair value
of the hedged item and the fair value of the related derivative instrument and its effectiveness as a hedge. As the derivative
is marked to fair value, we elected an accounting policy to net the fair value of our derivatives when a master netting arrangement
exists with our counterparties.

A derivative instrument that hedges a forecasted
transaction or the variability of cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability may be designated as a cash flow hedge.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings. To the extent that an instrument
is not effective as a hedge, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.
Realized gains and losses related to our effective fuel hedges are recognized in fuel expense. For presentation in our consolidated
statements of cash flows, we have elected to classify the cash flows from our cash flow hedges in the same category as the cash
flows from the items being hedged.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

We monitor concentrations of credit risk
associated with financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business. Credit risk, including but not limited
to counterparty non-performance under derivative instruments, our Revolving Loan Facility and new ship progress payment guarantees,
is not considered significant, as we primarily conduct business with large, well-established financial institutions and insurance
companies that we have well-established relationships with and that have credit risks acceptable to us or the credit risk is spread
out among a large number of creditors. We do not anticipate non-performance by any of our significant counterparties.

Insurance

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance
for a number of risks including claims related to crew and guests, hull and machinery, war risk, workers’ compensation, property
damage, employee healthcare and general liability. Liabilities associated with certain of these risks, including crew and passenger
claims, are estimated actuarially based upon known facts, historical trends and a reasonable estimate of future expenses. While
we believe these accruals are adequate, the ultimate losses incurred may differ from those recorded.

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
calculated in accordance with the liability method. Deferred taxes are recorded using the currently enacted tax rates that apply
in the periods that the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred taxes are not discounted.

We provide a valuation allowance on deferred
tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. With respect to acquired deferred tax assets,
changes within the measurement period that result from new information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition
date shall be recognized through a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Subsequent to the measurement period, all other changes
shall be reported as a reduction or increase to income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.

Share-Based Compensation

We recognize expense for our share-based
compensation awards using a fair-value-based method. Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service
period for awards that are based on a service period and not contingent upon any future performance. We refer you to Note 10—
“Employee Benefits and Share-Based Compensation.”

Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting
Guidance

In August 2018,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles

—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s
Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract (a consensus of the FAS
Emerging Issues Task Force),

which is designed to align the accounting for costs of implementing a cloud computing service
arrangement, regardless of whether the hosting arrangement conveys a license to the hosted software. The update requires that for
hosting arrangements considered to be a service contract, the criteria for capitalization of developing or obtaining internal-use
software shall be applied. The update is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning
after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in any interim period. A prospective or retrospective
transition approach must be elected. The Company is evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted
ASU No. 2017-12,

Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) — Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

,
which simplifies the accounting for derivatives. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges,
the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), reclassified into
earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and presented in the same income statement
line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. The Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings related to the elimination of the separate
measurement of ineffectiveness for its cash flow hedges, upon adoption. The adjustments were not material to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. We refer you to Note 9— “Fair Value Measurements and Derivatives” in these
notes to consolidated financial statements.

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted
ASU No. 2016-16,

Income Taxes (Topic 740) — Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory,

which requires
companies to recognize the income-tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer
occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. The Company recorded, upon adoption, a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings of $19.1 million, which captures the write-off of previously unamortized deferred income tax expense
from past intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory not previously recognized under accounting principles generally
accepted in the U.S.

In December 2017, the Act  was enacted, and among other provisions, reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35%
to 21%. Also in December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 118, which addresses the
recognition of provisional amounts when a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including
computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes by the Act. The measurement period
ends when a company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend
beyond one year. The Company completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act. There was no material change
to the $7.4 million reduction of the value of net deferred tax liabilities (which represent future tax expenses) recorded in 2017
as a discrete tax benefit resulting from the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the Act. Other aspects of the Act
were either not applicable or did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-04,

Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) — Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,

which simplifies
the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment
loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The guidance
is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption
permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company does not
expect to early adopt this guidance. The Company will evaluate, upon adoption of this guidance, the impact of this guidance on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842),

which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure
of leases. The update was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing rights and obligations
resulting from leases as lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements
for leases with a term of 12 months or more. The update modifies lessors’ classification criteria for leases and the accounting
for sales-type and direct financing leases. The update requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to give financial
statement users additional information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The update is
effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. The
Company has engaged a third party to assist in reviewing the Company’s existing leases and evaluating the Company’s
existing contracts to identify those that are considered to be leases under the new guidance. The Company will elect to combine lease and non-lease components as a lessee, to keep leases with an
initial term of 12 months or less off the balance sheet, and, if any non-lease component associated with the lease component is
the predominant component, the Company will account for the combined component in accordance with FASB ASU No. 2014-09,

Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

(“Topic 606”), as the lessor. The update is to be applied retrospectively
with a cumulative-effect adjustment on January 1, 2019. The Company continues to evaluate the effect that the update will
have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company expects the update to have a material effect on the
Company’s assets and liabilities, which will result in a balance sheet presentation that is not comparable to the prior period
in the first year of adoption. The Company does not expect the update to have a material impact on the Company’s annual
results of operations and/or cash flows.

Revenue and Expense from
Contracts with Customers

On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606,
which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605—Revenue Recognition

(Topic
605)

(“Topic 605”). Using the modified retrospective method, we applied the new requirements to those contracts
which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented below
under “— Financial Statement Presentation” and “— Impacts on Financial Statements,” while prior
period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under Topic 605.

Nature of Goods and Services

We offer our guests a multitude of cruise
fare options when booking a cruise. Our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities
and amenities, as well as meals and entertainment. In some instances, cruise ticket prices include round-trip airfare to and from
the port of embarkation, complimentary beverages, unlimited shore excursions, free internet, pre-cruise hotel packages, and on
some of the exotic itineraries, pre- or post-land packages. Prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary, stateroom
category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place. Passenger ticket revenue also includes full ship charters as
well as port fees and taxes.

During the voyage, we generate onboard
and other revenue for additional products and services which are not included in the cruise fare, including casino operations,
certain food and beverage, gift shop purchases, spa services, photo services and other similar items. Food and beverage, casino
operations and shore excursions are generally managed directly by us while retail shops, spa services, art auctions and internet
services may be managed through contracts with third-party concessionaires. These contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage
of the gross sales derived from these concessions, which is recognized on a net basis. While some onboard goods and services may
be prepaid prior to the voyage, we utilize point-of-sale systems for discrete purchases made onboard. Certain of our product offerings
are bundled and we allocate the value of the bundled goods and services between passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other
revenue based upon the relative standalone selling prices of those goods and services.

Timing of Satisfaction of Performance
Obligations and Significant Payment Terms

The payment terms and cancellation policies
vary by brand, stateroom category, length of voyage, and country of purchase. A deposit for a future booking is required at or
soon after the time of booking. Final payment is generally due between 120 days and 180 days before the voyage. Deposits on advance
ticket sales are deferred when received, and include amounts that are refundable. Deferred amounts are subsequently recognized
as revenue ratably during the voyage sailing days as services are rendered over time on the ship. Deposits are generally cancellable
and refundable prior to sailing, but may be subject to penalties, depending on the timing of cancellation. The inception of substantive
cancellation penalties generally coincides with the dates that final payment is due, and penalties generally increase as the voyage
sail date approaches. Cancellation fees are recognized in passenger ticket revenue in the month of the cancellation.

Goods and services associated with onboard
revenue are generally provided at a point in time and revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied. Onboard
goods and services rendered may be paid at disembarkation. A receivable is recognized for onboard goods and services rendered when
the voyage is not completed before the end of the period.

Cruises that are reserved under full ship
charter agreements are subject to the payment terms of the specific agreement and may be either cancelable or non-cancelable. Deposits
received on charter voyages are deferred when received and included in advance ticket sales. Deferred amounts are subsequently
recognized as revenue ratably over the voyage sailing dates.

F-



Contract Balances

Receivables from customers are included
within accounts receivables, net. As of December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018, our receivables from customers were $17.3 million
and $13.8 million, respectively.

Contract liabilities represent the Company’s
obligation to transfer goods and services to a customer. A customer deposit held for a future cruise is generally considered a
contract liability only when final payment is both due and paid by the customer and is usually recognized in earnings within 180
days of becoming a contract. Other deposits held and included within advance ticket sales or other long-term liabilities are not
considered contract liabilities as they are largely cancelable and refundable. Our contract liabilities are included within advance
ticket sales. As of December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018, our contract liabilities were $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.
Of the amounts included within contract liabilities, approximately 50% were refundable in accordance with our cancellation policies.
Approximately $1.0 billion of the January 1, 2018 contract liability balance has been recognized in revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

Our revenue is seasonal and based on the
demand for cruises. Historically, the seasonality of the North American cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand
for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. This predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations
by quarter in our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of
service for regularly scheduled Dry-docks, which we typically schedule during non-peak demand periods. This seasonality will result
in higher contract liability balances as a result of an increased number of reservations preceding these peak demand periods. The
addition of new ships also increases the contract liability balances prior to a new ship’s delivery, as staterooms are usually
made available for reservation prior to the inaugural cruise. Norwegian Bliss, with approximately 4,000 Berths, was delivered on
April 19, 2018 and added 8% capacity to our fleet.

Practical Expedients and Exemptions

We do not disclose information about remaining
performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. We recognize revenue in an amount that corresponds
directly with the value to the customer of our performance completed to date. Variable consideration, which will be determined
based on a future rate and passenger count, is excluded from the disclosure and these amounts are not material. These variable
non-disclosed contractual amounts relate to our non-cancelable charter agreements and a leasing arrangement with a certain port,
both of which are long-term in nature. Amounts that are fixed in nature due to the application of minimum guarantees are also not
material and are not disclosed.

Contract Costs

Management expects that incremental commissions
and credit card fees paid as a result of obtaining ticket contracts are recoverable; therefore, we recognize these amounts as assets
when they are paid prior to the voyage. Costs of air tickets and port taxes and fees that fulfill future performance obligations
are also considered recoverable and are recorded as assets. As of December 31, 2018, $116.3 million of costs incurred to obtain
customers and $32.5 million of costs to fulfill contracts with customers are recognized as assets within prepaid expenses and other
assets. Incremental commissions, credit card fees, air ticket costs, and port taxes and fees are recognized ratably over the voyage
sailing dates, concurrent with associated revenue, and are primarily in commissions, transportation and other expense.

Financial Statement Presentation

As of January 1, 2018, in connection with
the adoption of Topic 606, we reclassified $51.6 million of deferred costs associated with obtaining customer contracts to prepaid
expenses and other assets from advance ticket sales.

Impacts on Financial Statements

The adoption of Topic 606 does not change
the timing, classification or amount of revenue recognized from customers in our consolidated financial statements nor does it
change the timing, classification or amount of incremental costs to obtain and fulfill those contracts with customers. Therefore,
the adoption had no impact on our consolidated statement of operations or consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

On April 19, 2018, we took delivery of
Norwegian Bliss. To finance the payment due upon delivery, we had export financing in place for 80% of the contract price. The
associated $850.0 million term loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.92% with a maturity date of April 19, 2030. Principal and
interest payments are payable semiannually.

On April 4, 2018, we redeemed $135.0 million
principal amount of the $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “Notes”)
at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and paid the premium of $5.1 million and accrued interest
of $1.9 million. The redemption also resulted in a write off of $1.2 million of certain fees. Following the partial redemption,
$565.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes remained outstanding.

Interest expense, net for the year ended
December 31, 2018 was $270.4 million which included $31.4 million of amortization of deferred financing fees and a $6.3 million
loss on extinguishment of debt. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $267.8 million which included $32.5
million of amortization of deferred financing fees and a $23.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt. Interest expense, net for
the year ended December 31, 2016 was $276.9 million which included $34.7 million of amortization of deferred financing fees and
a $27.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt.

Certain of our debt agreements contain
covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity, as well as limit our net funded debt-to-capital
ratio, and maintain certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends. Substantially all of our ships and other property
and equipment are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt. We believe we were in compliance with our covenants as of December
31, 2018.

Fair Value Measurements
and Derivatives

Fair value is defined as the price at which
an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement
date under current market conditions (that is, an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant
that holds the asset or owes the liability).

Fair Value Hierarchy

The following hierarchy for inputs used
in measuring fair value should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that
the most observable inputs be used when available:

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement dates.

Level 2 — Significant other observable
inputs that are used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources.

Level 3 — Significant unobservable
inputs we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available.

Derivatives

We are exposed to market risk attributable
to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We attempt to minimize these risks through a combination
of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives. We assess whether derivatives used in hedging
transactions are “highly effective” in offsetting changes in the cash flow of our hedged forecasted transactions. We
use regression analysis for this hedge relationship and high effectiveness is achieved when a statistically valid relationship
reflects a high degree of offset and correlation between the fair values of the derivative and the hedged forecasted transaction.
Cash flows from the derivatives are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying hedged transaction. If
it is determined that the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, then the amount recognized in accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) is released to earnings. There are no amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
and there are no credit-risk-related contingent features in our derivative agreements. We monitor concentrations of credit risk
associated with financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business. Credit risk, including but not limited
to counterparty non-performance under derivatives, is not considered significant, as we primarily conduct business with large,
well-established financial institutions with which we have established relationships, and which have credit risks acceptable to
us, or the credit risk is spread out among many creditors. We do not anticipate non-performance by any of our significant counterparties.

As of December 31, 2018, we had fuel swaps,
which are used to mitigate the financial impact of volatility of fuel prices pertaining to approximately 1.3 million metric tons
of our projected fuel purchases, maturing through December 31, 2021.

As of December 31, 2018, we had foreign
currency forward contracts, matured foreign currency options and matured foreign currency collars which are used to mitigate the
financial impact of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros.
The notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts was €2.1 billion, or $2.4 billion based on the euro/U.S. dollar
exchange rate as of December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2018, we had interest rate swap agreements
which are used to hedge our exposure to interest rate movements and manage our interest expense. The notional amount of our outstanding
debt associated with the interest rate swap agreements was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2018.

The fair values of swap and forward contracts
are determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly
quoted markets. The Company determines the value of options and collars utilizing an option pricing model based on inputs that
are either readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets. The option
pricing model used by the Company is an industry standard model for valuing options and is used by the broker/dealer community.
The inputs to this option pricing model are the option strike price, underlying price, risk-free rate of interest, time to expiration,
and volatility. The fair value of option contracts considers both the intrinsic value and any remaining time value associated with
those derivatives that have not yet settled. The Company also considers counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk in its
determination of all estimated fair values.

Our derivatives and financial instruments
were categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, and we had no derivatives or financial instruments categorized as Level
1 or Level 3. Our derivative contracts include rights of offset with our counterparties. We have elected to net certain assets
and liabilities within counterparties when the rights of offset exist. We are not required to post cash collateral related to our
derivative instruments.

The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated
balance sheets of all other financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value.

Long-Term Debt

As of December 31, 2018 and
2017, the fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $6,601.9 million and $6,448.6 million,
respectively, which was $8.4 million higher and $23.5 million higher, respectively, than the carrying values. The difference
between the fair value and carrying value of our long-term debt is due to our fixed and variable rate debt obligations
carrying interest rates that are above or below market rates at the measurement dates. Market risk associated with our
long-term variable rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates. The fair value
of our long-term debt was calculated based on estimated rates for the same or similar instruments with similar terms and
remaining maturities, which represent Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.

Non-Recurring Measurements of Non-Financial
Assets

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets,
principally tradenames, are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances
that would indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable.

We believe our estimates and judgments
with respect to our long-lived assets, principally ships, and goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable.
Nonetheless, if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material
change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets, we could be required to record an impairment charge. We estimate
fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates, judgments and projections as necessary. As of December 31,
2018, our annual review supports the carrying value of these assets.

Employee Benefits and
Share-Based Compensation

Share-Based Compensation

As a result of NCLH’s adoption of
ASU No. 2016-09, beginning in the first quarter of 2017, NCLH began accounting for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating
expected forfeitures. Pursuant to the modified-retrospective application, the net cumulative effect of this change was recognized
as a $2.2 million increase to retained earnings as of January 1, 2017. We refer you to our consolidated statements of changes in
shareholders’ equity.

Amended and Restated 2013 Performance
Incentive Plan

In January 2013, NCLH adopted the
2013 Performance Incentive Plan, which provided for the issuance of up to 15,035,106 of
NCLH’s ordinary shares pursuant to awards granted under the plan, with no more than 5,000,000 shares being granted to
one individual in any calendar year. In May 2016, the plan was amended and restated (“Restated 2013 Plan”)
pursuant to approval from the Board of Directors and NCLH’s shareholders. Among other things, under the Restated 2013
Plan, the number of NCLH’s ordinary shares that may be delivered pursuant to all awards granted under the plan was
increased by an additional 12,430,000 shares to a new maximum aggregate limit of 27,465,106 shares. Additionally, the
expiration date of the Restated 2013 Plan was extended to March 30, 2026. Share options under the plan are granted with an
exercise price equal to the closing market price of NCLH shares at the date of grant. The vesting period for time-based
options is typically set at three, four or five years with a contractual life ranging from seven to 10 years. The vesting
period for time-based and performance-based restricted share units is generally three years. Forfeited awards will be
available for subsequent awards under the Restated 2013 Plan.

F-



Share Option Awards

No time-based share option awards were
granted for the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017. The fair value of each time-based option award is estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The estimated fair value of the share options is amortized over the vesting
period using the straight-line method. The assumptions used within the option-pricing model for the time-based awards are
as follows:


Dividend yield

—%

Expected share price volatility

30.36%-33.01

%

Risk-free interest rate

1.20%-1.48

%

Expected term

6.00 years

Expected volatility was determined based
on the historical share prices in our industry. The risk-free rate was based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining
term equal to the expected option term at grant date. The expected term was calculated under the simplified method.

The performance-based options awarded to
our President and Chief Executive Officer in August 2015 are subject to performance conditions such that the number of awards that
ultimately vest depends on the adjusted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”) and adjusted return on invested capital
(“Adjusted ROIC”) achieved by the Company during the performance period compared to targets established at the award
date. Although the terms of the performance-based awards provide the compensation committee with the discretion to make certain
adjustments to the performance calculation, it was determined that a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the
awards has been ascertained. In 2018, the grant date was therefore established for performance-based awards granted in prior years.
The fair value of each performance-based option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The estimated fair value of the share options is amortized over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The assumptions used within the option-pricing model for the performance-based awards are as follows:

equal installments over four years and are expected to vest on January 1, 2019. The total fair value of shares vested during the
years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

Restricted Share Unit (“RSU”)
Awards

On March 1, 2018, NCLH granted to certain
employees 1.6 million time-based RSU awards which vest equally over three years. Also on March 1, 2018, NCLH granted to certain
members of our management team 0.5 million performance-based RSU awards, which vest upon the achievement of certain pre-established
performance targets and which amount assumes the maximum level of achievement.

F-



The fair value of the time-based and performance-based
RSUs is equal to the closing market price of NCLH shares at the date of grant. The performance-based RSUs awarded to certain members
of our management team are subject to performance conditions such that the number of shares that ultimately vest depends on the
Adjusted EPS and Adjusted ROIC achieved by the Company during the performance period compared to targets established at the award
date. Although the terms of the performance-based RSU awards provide the compensation committee with the discretion to make certain
adjustments to the performance calculation, it was determined that a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the
awards has been ascertained. In 2018, the grant date was therefore established for performance-based RSU awards granted in
prior years. The Company remeasures the probability and the cumulative share-based compensation expense of the awards each reporting
period until vesting or forfeiture occurs.

The following table sets forth a summary
of RSU activity and includes 0.3 million previously awarded performance-based RSU awards for which the grant date was established
in 2018 (the number of RSUs reported assumes the maximum level of achievement), for the period presented:

As of December 31, 2018, there was
total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested time-based, non-vested performance-based and market-based RSUs of $97.7
million, $25.8 million and $0, respectively. The costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years,
1.9 years and 0 years, respectively, for the time-based, performance-based and market-based RSUs. Taxes paid pursuant to net share
settlements in 2018 and 2017 were $13.9 million and $6.3 million, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)

In April 2014, NCLH’s shareholders
approved the ESPP. The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to purchase NCLH’s ordinary
shares at a favorable price and upon favorable terms in consideration of the participating employees’ continued services.
A maximum of 2,000,000 of NCLH’s ordinary shares may be purchased under the ESPP. To be eligible to participate in an offering
period, on the grant date of that period, an individual must be customarily employed by the Company or a participating subsidiary
for more than twenty hours per week and for more than five months per calendar year. Participation in the ESPP is also subject
to certain limitations. The ESPP is considered to be compensatory based on: a) the 15% purchase price discount and b) the look-back
purchase price feature. Since the plan is compensatory, compensation expense must be recorded in the consolidated statements of
operations on a straight-line basis over the six-month withholding period. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had a liability
for payroll withholdings received of $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively.

Employee Benefit Plans

We offer annual incentive bonuses pursuant
to our Restated 2013 Plan for our executive officers and other key employees. Bonuses under the plan become earned and payable
based on the Company’s performance during the applicable performance period and the individual’s continued employment.
Company performance criteria include the attainment of certain financial targets and other strategic objectives.

Certain employees are employed pursuant
to agreements that provide for severance payments. Severance is generally only payable upon an involuntary termination of the employment
by us without cause or a termination by the employee for good reason. Severance generally includes a series of cash payments based
on the employee’s base salary (and in some cases, bonus), and our payment of the employee’s continued medical benefits
for the applicable severance period.

We maintain a 401(k) Plan for our shoreside
employees, including our executive officers. Participants may contribute up to 100% of eligible compensation each pay period, subject
to certain limitations. We make matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 3% and 50% of amounts greater than 3% to and
including 10% of each participant’s contributions subject to certain limitations. In addition, we may make discretionary
supplemental contributions to the 401(k) Plan, which shall be allocated pro rata to each eligible participant based on the compensation
of the participant relative to the total compensation of all participants. Our matching contributions are vested according to a
five-year schedule. The 401(k) Plan is subject to the provisions of ERISA and is intended to be qualified under section 401(a)
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).

Our matching contributions are reduced
by amounts forfeited by those employees who leave the 401(k) Plan prior to vesting fully in the matching contributions. Forfeited
contributions of $0.3 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million were utilized in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively.

We maintained a Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which is a legacy unfunded defined contribution plan for certain executives who were employed
by the Company in an executive capacity prior to 2008. The SERP was frozen to future participation following that date. The SERP
provided for Company contributions on behalf of the participants to compensate them for the benefits that are limited under the
401(k) Plan. We credited participants under the SERP for amounts that would have been contributed by us to the Company’s
previous Defined Contribution Retirement Plan and the former 401(k) Plan without regard to any limitations imposed by the Code.
Participants did not make any elective contributions under this plan. We discontinued this plan following the 2015 contributions
and paid the previously deferred contributions to participants in early 2017 following the expiration of the required 12 month
waiting period.

We recorded combined total expenses related
to the above 401(k) Plan and SERP of $9.3 million, $7.3 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017
and 2016, respectively.

Effective January 2009, we
implemented the Shipboard Retirement Plan which computes benefits based on years of service, subject to eligibility
requirements. The Shipboard Retirement Plan is unfunded with no plan assets. The current portion of the projected benefit
obligation of $1.0 million and $1.1 million was included in accrued expenses and other liabilities as of December 31,
2018 and 2017, respectively, and $23.3 million and $23.5 million was included in other long-term liabilities in our
consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

the actuarial loss is amortized over 18.93 years. The discount rate is used to measure and recognize obligations, including adjustments
to other comprehensive income (loss), and to determine expense during the periods. It is determined by using bond indices which
reflect yields on a broad maturity and industry universe of high-quality corporate bonds.

On January 1, 2018, NCLH adopted ASU No.
2017-07,

Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)

, which requires the components of pension expense not associated
with service costs to be recognized separately from the service cost component and outside operating income. For the year ended
December 31, 2018, services costs are recognized in payroll and related expense while non-service cost components are recognized
in other income (expense), net. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, services costs and non-service cost components
are both recognized in payroll and related expense.

Income Taxes

We are incorporated in Bermuda. Under current
Bermuda law, we are not subject to tax on income and capital gains. We have received from the Minister of Finance under The Exempted
Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966, as amended, an assurance that, in the event that Bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax
computed on profits, income, any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance, then
the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to us or to any of our operations or shares, debentures or other obligations,
until March 31, 2035.

We have U.S. net operating loss carryforwards
of $278.3 million and $254.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which begin to expire in 2023.
We have state net operating loss carryforwards of $4.8 million and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017,
respectively, which expire between 2025 through 2035.

Included above are deferred tax assets
associated with our operations in Norway for which we have provided a full valuation allowance. We have Norway net operating loss
carryforwards of $13.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which can be carried forward indefinitely.

Included above are deferred tax assets
associated with our branch operations in the U.K. for which we have provided a full valuation allowance. We have U.K. net operating
loss carryforwards of $7.5 million and $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which can be
carried forward indefinitely.

Included above are deferred tax assets
associated with Prestige for which we have provided a full valuation allowance. We have U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of
$177.5 million and $177.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which begin to expire in 2023. Utilization
of the Prestige net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations
that have occurred previously and/or that could occur in the future, as provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (“Section 382”). Ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized
to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from
transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage
points over a three-year period. If we have experienced an ownership change, utilization of Prestige’s net operating loss
carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion
of the net operating loss carryforwards before utilization. Subsequent ownership changes could further impact the limitation in
future years. During 2018, we implemented certain tax restructuring that created the potential to utilize the net operating loss
carryforwards referred to above. We are currently undergoing a Section 382 study to determine the amount of the Prestige
net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized against future taxable income, the result of which could potentially result
in the reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance. We expect the study to be complete in the first half
of 2019.

In December 2017, the Act was enacted,
and among other provisions, reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Also in December 2017, the SEC
staff issued SAB No. 118, which addresses the recognition of provisional amounts when a company does not have the necessary information
available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the effect of the
changes in the Act. The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to
finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year. The Company completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment
of the Act. There is no material change to the $7.4 million reduction of the value of net deferred tax liabilities (which represents
future tax expenses) recorded in 2017 as a discrete tax benefit resulting from the federal corporate income tax rate reduction.
Other aspects of the Act were either not applicable or did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts
of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):

In 2017, $10.7 million of unrecognized
tax benefits were reversed due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. If the $0.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits
at December 31, 2018 were recognized, our effective tax rate would be minimally affected. We believe that there will not be a significant
increase or decrease to the tax positions within 12 months of the reporting date. We recognize interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

We file income tax returns in the U.S.
federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. We are generally no longer subject to U.S. federal,
state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by authorities for years prior to 2015, except for years in which NOLs generated
prior to 2015 are utilized.

Due to our international structure as well
as the existence of international tax treaties that exempt taxation on certain activities, the repatriation of earnings from our
subsidiaries would have no tax impact.

F-



We derive our income from the international
operation of ships. We are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. and receive income from sources within the U.S. Under Section
883, certain foreign corporations are exempt from U. S. federal income or branch profits tax on U.S.-source income derived from
or incidental to the international operation of ships. Applicable U.S. treasury regulations provide that a foreign corporation
will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part: (i) the foreign country in which the corporation is organized
grants an equivalent exemption for income from the international operation of ships to corporations organized in the U.S., and
(ii) the foreign corporation has one or more classes of stock that are “primarily and regularly traded on an established
securities market” in the U.S. or another qualifying country. We believe that we qualify for the benefits of Section 883
because we are incorporated in qualifying countries and our ordinary shares are primarily and regularly traded on an established
securities market in the U.S.

Ship Construction Contracts

Project Leonardo will introduce an additional
six ships, each approximately 140,000 Gross Tons with approximately 3,300 Berths, with expected delivery dates from 2022 through
2027, subject to certain conditions. The effectiveness of the contracts to construct two of the ships, expected to be delivered
in 2026 and 2027, is contingent upon certain Italian government approvals. We have a Breakaway Plus Class Ship, Norwegian Encore,
with approximately 168,000 Gross Tons with 4,000 Berths, on order for delivery in the fall of 2019, and an Explorer Class Ship,
Seven Seas Splendor, with approximately 55,000 Gross Tons and 750 Berth, on order for delivery in the winter of 2020. We also plan
to introduce three additional ships, one for Regent and two for Oceania Cruises (we refer you to Note 17— “Subsequent
Events”).

The combined contract prices of the eight
ships on order for delivery was approximately €6.3 billion, or $7.2 billion based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as
of December 31, 2018.

We have obtained export credit financing
for the ships on order which is expected to fund approximately 80% of each contract price, subject to certain conditions. We refer
you to Note 17— “Subsequent Events” for details regarding the financing for certain ships. We do not anticipate
any contractual breaches or cancellation to occur. However, if any such events were to occur, it could result in, among other things,
the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Other Commitments

The FMC requires evidence of financial
responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of U.S. ports to indemnify passengers in the
event of non-performance of the transportation. Accordingly, each of our three brands are required to maintain a $30.0 million
third-party performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations to passengers.
The guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price index-based adjustments. Also, each of our brands have a legal
requirement to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the U.K. As of December 31, 2018, approximately
British Pound Sterling 30.5 million was in place to support our security guarantees. We also are required by other jurisdictions
to establish financial responsibility to meet liability in the event of non-performance of our obligations to passengers from those
jurisdictions.

From time to time, various other regulatory
and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the U.S. and the
cruise industry in general.

Litigation

In the normal course of our business, various
claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us. Most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and,
accordingly, the maximum amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount.

Nonetheless, the ultimate outcome of these
claims and lawsuits that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time. We have evaluated our overall exposure
with respect to all of our threatened and pending litigation and, to the extent required, we have accrued amounts for all estimable
probable losses associated with our deemed exposure. We are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses
beyond those accrued, as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential
recovery. However, based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that the aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible
losses with respect to these matters will be material to our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
We intend to vigorously defend our legal position on all claims and, to the extent necessary, seek recovery.

Other Income (Expense),
Net

Other income (expense), net was a gain
of $20.7 million, loss of $10.4 million, and loss of $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
In 2018, the income was primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains. In 2017, the expense was primarily due to foreign currency
exchange losses. In 2016, the expense was primarily related to $16.1 million of unrealized and realized losses on fuel swap derivative
hedge contracts partially offset by $4.5 million of gains on foreign currency exchange and $3.9 million of gains on foreign currency
exchange derivative hedge contracts.

The seasonality of the North American cruise
industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. This predictable
seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is
increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled Dry-docks, which we typically scheduled during non-peak
demand periods.

Subsequent Events

In January 2019, we (a) reduced the pricing
of our existing $875.0 million Revolving Loan Facility, (b) reduced the pricing and increased the approximately $1.3 billion principal
amount outstanding under the term loan A facility to $1.6 billion, and (c) extended the maturity dates for our Revolving Loan Facility
and our term loan A facility to 2024, subject to certain conditions. The applicable margin under the Revolving Loan Facility and
term loan A facility and was reduced by 25 basis points from the prior facility. We used the proceeds from the increase in our
term loan A facility to prepay all of the then outstanding amounts under the term loan B facility.

In January 2019, we
obtained financing for five additional ships with expected delivery dates through 2027, subject to certain Italian
government approvals. Two of such ships are Project Leonardo ships which were ordered for delivery in 2026 and 2027 and each
have a contract price which is approximately €800.0 million, or $917.4 million based on the exchange rate as of December
31, 2018. We have ordered an additional Explorer Class Ship to be delivered in 2023. The contract price for this ship is
approximately €473.5 million, or $543.0 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2018. We also have ordered
two Allura Class Ships to be delivered in 2022 and 2025. The contract price for each of these ships is approximately
€578.7 million, or $663.6 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2018. We have obtained export credit
financing which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through
2027, subject to certain conditions.
