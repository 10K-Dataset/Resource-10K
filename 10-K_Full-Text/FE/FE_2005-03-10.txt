TABLE OF
CONTENTS

PART
I

ITEM

1.
      BUSINESS

The
Company

FirstEnergy Corp.
was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1996. FirstEnergy's
principal business is the holding, directly or indirectly, of all of the
outstanding common stock of its eight principal electric utility operating
subsidiaries: OE, CEI, TE, Penn, ATSI, JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec. These
utility operating subsidiaries are referred to throughout as the “Companies.”
FirstEnergy's consolidated revenues are primarily derived from electric service
provided by its utility operating subsidiaries and the revenues of its other
principal subsidiaries: FES; FSG; MYR; and FirstCom. In addition, FirstEnergy
holds all of the outstanding common stock of other direct subsidiaries
including: FirstEnergy Properties, Inc., FirstEnergy Ventures Corp., FENOC,
FirstEnergy Securities Transfer Company, GPU Diversified Holdings, LLC, GPU
Telecom Services, Inc., GPU Nuclear, Inc.; and FESC.

The Companies’
combined service areas encompass approximately 36,100 square miles in Ohio, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania. The areas they serve have a combined population of
approximately 11.2 million.

OE was organized
under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1930 and owns property and does business
as an electric public utility in that state. OE also has ownership interests in
certain generating facilities located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (see
Item 2 - Properties). OE engages in the generation, distribution and sale of
electric energy to communities in a 7,500 square mile area of central and
northeastern Ohio. OE also engages in the sale, purchase and interchange of
electric energy with other electric companies. The area it serves has a
population of approximately 2.8 million.

OE owns all of
Penn's outstanding common stock. Penn was organized under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1930 and owns property and does business as an
electric public utility in that state. Penn is also authorized to do business
and owns property in the State of Ohio (see Item 2 - Properties). Penn furnishes
electric service to communities in a 1,500 square mile area of western
Pennsylvania. The area served by Penn has a population of approximately
0.3 million.

CEI was organized
under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1892 and does business as an electric
public utility in that state. CEI engages in the generation, distribution and
sale of electric energy in an area of approximately 1,700 square miles in
northeastern Ohio. It also has ownership interests in certain generating
facilities in Pennsylvania (see Item 2 - Properties). CEI also engages in the
sale, purchase and interchange of electric energy with other electric companies.
The area CEI serves has a population of approximately
1.9 million.

TE was organized
under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1901 and does business as an electric
public utility in that state. TE engages in the generation, distribution and
sale of electric energy in an area of approximately 2,500 square miles in
northwestern Ohio. It also has interests in certain generating facilities in
Pennsylvania (see Item 2 - Properties). TE also engages in the sale, purchase
and interchange of electric energy with other electric companies. The area TE
serves has a population of approximately 0.8 million.

ATSI was organized
under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1998. ATSI owns transmission assets that
were formerly owned by the Ohio Companies and Penn. ATSI owns and operates
major, high-voltage transmission facilities, which consist of approximately
7,100 circuit miles (5,814 pole miles) of transmission lines with nominal
voltages of 345 kV, 138 kV and 69 kV. There are 37 interconnections with six
neighboring control areas. ATSI's transmission system offers gateways into the
East through high capacity ties with PJM through Penelec, Duquesne Light Company
and Allegheny Energy, Inc. into the North through multiple 345 kV high capacity
ties with MEC, and into the South through ties with AEP and DPL. ATSI is the
control area operator for the Ohio Companies and Penn service areas. ATSI plans,
operates and maintains the transmission system in accordance with the
requirements of the NERC and applicable regulatory agencies to ensure reliable
service to FirstEnergy's customers (see Transmission Rate Matters for a
discussion of ATSI's participation in the MISO).

JCP&L was
organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey in 1925 and owns property
and does business as an electric public utility in that state. JCP&L
provides transmission and distribution services in northern, western and east
central New Jersey. The area JCP&L serves has a population of approximately
2.5 million.

and services, and through its FGCO subsidiary, operates FirstEnergy's nonnuclear
generation businesses. FENOC was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio
in 1998 and operates the Companies’ nuclear generating facilities. FSG is the
parent company of several HVAC and energy management companies; MYR is a utility
infrastructure construction service company. FirstCom provides telecommunication
services (local and long-distance phone service). FESC provides legal, financial
and other corporate support services to affiliated FirstEnergy
companies.

Divestitures

FirstEnergy
completed the sale of its international operations in January 2004 with the
sales of its remaining 20.1 percent interest in Avon on January 16, 2004,
and 28.67 percent interest in TEBSA on January 30, 2004. Impairment charges
related to Avon and TEBSA were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 and no
gain or loss was recognized upon the sales in 2004. Avon, TEBSA and other
international assets sold in 2003 were originally acquired as part of
FirstEnergy's November 2001 merger with GPU.

FirstEnergy sold
its 50 percent interest in GLEP on June 23, 2004. Proceeds of $220 million
included cash of $200 million and the right, valued at $20 million, to
participate for up to a 40% interest in future wells in Ohio. This transaction
produced an after-tax loss of $7 million, or $0.02 per share of common stock,
including the benefits of prior tax capital losses that had been previously
fully reserved, which offset the capital gain from the sale.

Risks
Factors That May Affect Results

Changes in
Commodity Prices Could Adversely Affect Our Margins

While much of our
generation serves customers under retail rates set by regulatory bodies, we also
purchase and sell electricity in the competitive wholesale and retail markets.
Increases in the costs of fuel for our generation facilities (particularly coal
and natural gas) can affect our profit margins in both competitive and
non-competitive markets. Changes in the market prices of electricity, which are
affected by changes in fuel costs and other factors, may impact our financial
results and financial position by increasing the amount we pay to purchase power
to supply PLR obligations in Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Electricity and
fuel prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time
for a variety of reasons, including:


Complex and
Changing Government Regulations Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Results of
Operations

We are subject to
comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies
that significantly influences our operating environment. Changes in or
reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws
or regulations could require us to incur additional costs or change the way we
conduct our business, and therefore could have an adverse impact on our results
of operations.

The Continuing
Availability and Operation of Generating Units is Dependent on Retaining the
Necessary Licenses, Permits, and Operating Authority from Governmental Entities,
Including the NRC

We are required to
have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the agencies that
regulate our business. We believe the necessary permits, approvals and
certificates have been obtained for our existing operations and that our
business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, we are unable
to predict the impact on operating results from future regulatory activities of
any of these agencies.

Costs of
Compliance with Environmental Laws are Significant, and the Cost of Compliance
with Future Environmental Laws Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow and
Profitability

FirstEnergy’s
subsidiaries’ operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local
environmental statutes, rules and regulations. Compliance with these legal
requirements requires us to incur significant costs toward environmental
monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees,
maintenance, upgrading, remediation and permitting at all of our facilities.
These expenditures have been significant in the past and may increase in the
future. If the cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and
regulations does increase, it could adversely affect our business and results of
operations, financial position and cash flows. Moreover, changes in
environmental laws or regulations may materially increase our costs of
compliance or accelerate the timing of capital expenditures. Because of the
deregulation of generation, we might not recover through rates additional costs
incurred for such compliance. Our compliance strategy, although reasonably based
on available information, may not successfully address the relevant standards
and interpretations in the future. If FirstEnergy fails to comply with
environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control
or new interpretations of longstanding requirements, that failure may result in
the assessment of civil or criminal liability and fines.

Risks of
Nuclear Generation that Include Uncertainties Relating to Health and Safety,
Additional Capital Costs, the Adequacy of Insurance Coverage and Nuclear Plant
Decommissioning

FirstEnergy is
subject to the risks of nuclear generation, including but not limited to the
following:

The NRC has broad
authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements
for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of
non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit,
or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until
compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could
necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants, including ours.
Unlike our fossil plants, which have been leased to and operated by FGCO since
2001, new capital costs as well as fuel, operation and maintenance expenses for
the nuclear plants continue to be borne by CEI, TE, OE and Penn.

The Companies’
respective interests in nuclear facilities are insured under NEIL, policies
issued for each plant. Under these policies, up to $2.75 billion is provided for
property damage and decontamination and decommissioning costs. We have also
obtained approximately $1.5 billion of insurance coverage for replacement power
costs for the Companies’ respective interests in nuclear facilities. Under these
policies, we can be assessed a maximum of approximately $67.5 million for
incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring during a policy year which
are in excess of accumulated funds available to the insurer for paying
losses.


Operational
Risks Arising from the Reliability of Our Power Plants and Transmission and
Distribution Equipment

Operation of power
plants, transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including
the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, labor disputes,
stray voltage and performance below expected levels. In addition,
weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation,
transmission and distribution delivery systems. Because our transmission
facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of
those facilities may be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable
events occurring on the systems of such third parties.

Operation of our
power plants below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues or
increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs that we may not be able
to recover from customers. Unplanned outages may require us to incur significant
replacement power costs. Moreover, if we were unable to perform under
contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages may
result.

We remain obligated
to provide safe and reliable service to customers within our franchised service
territories. Meeting this commitment requires significant capital and other
resources. Failure to provide safe and reliable service due to equipment failure
in the electric system could adversely affect our operating results through
reduced revenues and increased capital and maintenance costs.

Human
      Resource Risks Associated with the Availability of Trained and Qualified
      Labor to Meet Our Future Staffing
Requirements

Workforce
demographic issues are a national phenomenon that is of particular concern to
the electric utility industry. The median age of utility workers is
significantly higher than the national average. Today, nearly one-half of the
utility workforce is age 45 or higher. Consequently, the utility industry faces
the difficult challenge of finding ways to retain its aging skilled workforce
while recruiting new talent in the hopes of decreasing losses in critical
knowledge and skills due to retirements. Mitigating these risks may require
additional financial commitments.

Regulatory
Changes in the Electric Industry Could Affect Our Competitive Position and
Result in Unrecoverable Costs Adversely Affecting Our Business and Results of
Operations

As a result of the
actions taken by state legislative bodies over the last few years, major changes
in the electric utility business have occurred and are continuing to take place
in parts of the United States, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
These changes have resulted in fundamental alterations in the way integrated
utilities conduct their business.

Increased
competition resulting from restructuring efforts could have a significant
adverse financial impact on FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries and consequently on
their results of operations. Increased competition could result in increased
pressure to lower prices, including the price of electricity. Retail competition
and the unbundling of regulated electric service could have a significant
adverse financial impact on us due to potential impairment of assets, a loss of
retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of capital. We cannot
predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the
electric markets.

The FERC and U.S.
Congress propose from time to time significant changes in the structure and
conduct of the electric utility industry. If the restructuring and deregulation
efforts result in increased competition or unrecoverable costs, our business and
results of operations may be adversely affected. We cannot predict the extent
and timing of further efforts to restructure, deregulate or re-regulate our
business or the industry.

Weather
Conditions such as Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Storms and Droughts, as Well as
Seasonal Temperature Variations

Weather conditions
directly influence the demand for electric power. In our service areas, demand
for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also typically
peaking at that time. As a result, overall operating results may fluctuate on a
seasonal and quarterly basis. In addition, we have historically sold less power,
and consequently received less revenue, when weather conditions are milder.
Severe weather, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, storms and droughts, may cause
outages and property damage which may require us to incur additional costs that
are generally not insured and that may not be recoverable from customers. The
effect of the failure of our facilities to operate as planned, as described
above, would be particularly burdensome during a peak demand
period.


A Downgrade in
Credit Ratings Could Negatively Affect Our Ability to Access
Capital

We rely on access
to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements
not satisfied by cash flows from operations. Any inability to maintain our
current credit ratings could affect, particularly during times of uncertainty in
the capital markets, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms which, in
turn, could impact our ability to grow our businesses. A credit rating downgrade
would likely also increase our interest costs.

On July 22,
2004, S&P updated its analysis of U.S. utility FMB in response to changes in
the industry. As a result of its revised methodology for evaluating default
risk, S&P raised its FMB credit ratings for 20 U.S. utility companies
including JCP&L and Penn. JCP&L’s FMB credit rating was upgraded to BBB+
from BBB and Penn’s FMB credit rating was upgraded to BBB from
BBB-.

On August 26,
2004, S&P lowered its rating on certain Met-Ed Senior Notes to BBB- from
BBB. The rationale for the ratings change was that Met-Ed’s senior secured
notes, in aggregate, now comprise greater than 80% of Met-Ed’s total debt
outstanding. According to the terms of the senior note indenture, once the 80%
threshold is reached, the collateral mortgage bond security falls away and all
senior secured notes that were secured by Met-Ed’s senior note indenture become
unsecured. The one notch lower rating reflects this loss of collateral security.
The BBB senior secured rating on Met-Ed’s FMB remain unchanged.

Also on
August 26, 2004, S&P stated that a favorable outcome of the Ohio Rate
Stabilization Plan auction process and a favorable resolution of pending
environmental litigation would support a higher ratings outlook, or possibly a
higher rating. On September 14, 2004, S&P stated that FirstEnergy’s
$500 million voluntary contribution to its pension plan was credit
neutral.

On December 10,
2004, S&P reaffirmed its ‘BBB-‘ corporate credit rating on FirstEnergy and
kept the outlook stable. S&P noted that the stable outlook reflects
FirstEnergy’s improving financial profile and cash flow certainty through 2006.
S&P stated that should the two refueling outages at the Davis-Besse and
Perry nuclear plants scheduled for the first quarter of 2005 be completed
successfully without any significant negative findings and delays, FirstEnergy’s
outlook would be revised to positive. S&P also stated that a ratings upgrade
in the next several months did not seem likely, as remaining issues of concern
to S&P, primarily the outcome of environmental litigation and SEC
investigations, are not likely to be resolved in the short term.

Financial
Performance Risks Related to the Economic Cycles of the Electric Utility
Industry

Our business
follows the economic cycles of our customers. Sustained downturns or
sluggishness in the economy generally affects the markets in which the Companies
operate and negatively influences the Companies’ energy operations. Declines in
demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns will reduce overall
electricity sales and lessen our cash flows, especially as industrial customers
reduce production, resulting in less consumption of electricity. Economic
conditions also impact our collection rates of accounts receivable.

We May
Ultimately Incur Liability in Connection with Federal
Proceedings

On October 20,
2004, FirstEnergy was notified by the SEC that the previously disclosed informal
inquiry initiated by the SEC's Division of Enforcement in September 2003
relating to the restatements in August 2003 of previously reported results by
FirstEnergy and the Ohio Companies, and the Davis-Besse extended outage, has
become the subject of a formal order of investigation. The SEC's formal order of
investigation also encompasses issues raised during the SEC's examination of
FirstEnergy and the Companies under PUHCA. Concurrent with this notification,
FirstEnergy received a subpoena asking for background documents and documents
related to the restatements and Davis-Besse issues. On December 30, 2004,
FirstEnergy received a second subpoena asking for documents relating to issues
raised during the SEC's PUHCA examination. FirstEnergy has cooperated fully with
the informal inquiry and will continue to do so with the formal investigation.
If it were ultimately determined that FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries have legal
liability or are otherwise made subject to liability based on any of the above
matters, it could have a material adverse effect on FirstEnergy's or its
subsidiaries' financial condition and results of operations.

In late 2003, FENOC
received a subpoena from a grand jury sitting in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division requesting the
production of certain documents and records relating to the inspection and
maintenance of the reactor vessel head at Davis-Besse. We are unable to predict
the outcome of this investigation. On December 10, 2004, FirstEnergy
received a letter from the United States Attorney's Office stating that FENOC is
a target of the federal grand jury investigation into alleged false statements
relating to the Davis-Besse outage made to the NRC in the Fall of 2001 in
response to NRC Bulletin 2001-01. The letter also said that the designation of
FENOC as a target indicates that, in the view of the prosecutors assigned to the
matter, it is likely that federal charges will be returned against FENOC by the
grand jury. On February 10, 2005, FENOC received an additional subpoena for
documents related to root cause reports regarding reactor head degradation and
the assessment of reactor head management issues at Davis-Besse. In addition,
FENOC remains subject to possible civil enforcement action by the NRC in
connection with the events leading to the Davis-Besse outage in
2002.


On August 12, 2004,
the NRC notified FENOC that it will increase its regulatory oversight of the
Perry Nuclear Power Plant as a result of problems with safety system equipment
over the past two years. FENOC operates the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, which is
either owned or leased by OE, CEI, TE and Penn. Although the NRC noted that the
plant continues to operate safely, the agency has indicated that its increased
oversight will include an extensive NRC team inspection to assess the equipment
problems and the sufficiency of FENOC’s corrective actions. The outcome of these
matters could include NRC enforcement action or other impacts on operating
authority. As a result, these matters could have a material adverse effect on
FirstEnergy’s or its subsidiaries’ financial condition.

Utility
Regulation

As a registered
public utility holding company, FirstEnergy is subject to regulation by the SEC
under PUHCA. The SEC has determined that the electric facilities of the
Companies constitute a single integrated public utility system under the
standards of PUHCA. PUHCA regulates FirstEnergy with respect to accounting, the
issuance of securities, the acquisition and sale of utility assets, securities
or any other interest in any business, and entering into, and performance of,
service, sales and construction contracts among its subsidiaries, and certain
other matters. PUHCA also limits the extent to which FirstEnergy may engage in
nonutility businesses or acquire additional utility businesses. Each of the
Companies' retail rates, conditions of service, issuance of securities and other
matters are subject to regulation in the state in which each operates - in Ohio
by the PUCO, in New Jersey by the NJBPU and in Pennsylvania by the PPUC. With
respect to their wholesale and interstate electric operations and rates, the
Companies are subject to regulation, including regulation of their accounting
policies and practices, by the FERC. Under Ohio law, municipalities may regulate
rates, subject to appeal to the PUCO if not acceptable to the
utility.

Regulatory
Accounting

FirstEnergy
accounts for the effects of regulation through the application of SFAS 71 to its
operating utilities when their rates:

An enterprise
meeting all of these criteria capitalizes costs that would otherwise be charged
to expense if the rate actions of its regulator make it probable that those
costs will be recovered in future revenue. SFAS 71 is applied only to the parts
of the business that meet the above criteria. If a portion of the business
applying SFAS 71 no longer meets those requirements, previously recorded
regulatory assets are removed from the balance sheet in accordance with the
guidance in SFAS 101.

In Ohio, New Jersey
and Pennsylvania, laws applicable to electric industry restructuring contain
similar provisions that are reflected in the Companies' respective state
regulatory plans. These provisions include:


The EUOC recognize,
as regulatory assets, costs which the FERC, PUCO, PPUC and NJBPU have authorized
for recovery from customers in future periods or for which authorization is
probable. Without the probability of such authorization, costs currently
recorded as regulatory assets would have been charged to income as incurred. All
regulatory assets are expected to be recovered from customers under the
Companies' respective transition and regulatory plans. Based on those plans, the
Companies continue to bill and collect cost-based rates for their transmission
and distribution services, which remain regulated; accordingly, it is
appropriate that the Companies continue the application of SFAS 71 to those
operations.

Reliability
Initiatives

In late 2003 and
early 2004, a series of letters, reports and recommendations were issued from
various entities, including governmental, industry and ad hoc reliability
entities (PUCO, FERC, NERC and the U.S. - Canada Power System Outage Task Force)
regarding enhancements to regional reliability. With respect to each of these
reliability enhancement initiatives, FirstEnergy submitted its response to the
respective entity according to any required response dates. In 2004, we
completed implementation of all actions and initiatives related to enhancing
area reliability, improving voltage and reactive management, operator readiness
and training, and emergency response preparedness recommended for completion in
2004. Furthermore, FirstEnergy certified to NERC on June 30, 2004, with
minor exceptions noted, that we had completed the recommended enhancements,
policies, procedures and actions it had recommended be completed by June 30,
2004. In addition, FirstEnergy requested, and NERC provided, a technical
assistance team of experts to assist in implementing and confirming timely and
successful completion of various initiatives. The NERC-assembled independent
verification team confirmed on July 14, 2004, that FirstEnergy had
implemented the NERC Recommended Actions to Prevent and Mitigate the Impacts of
Future Cascading Blackouts required to be completed by June 30, 2004, as
well as NERC recommendations contained in the Control Area Readiness Audit
Report required to be completed by summer 2004, and recommendations in the U.S.
- - Canada Power System Outage Task Force Report directed toward FirstEnergy and
required to be completed by June 30, 2004, with minor exceptions noted by
FirstEnergy. On December 28, 2004, FirstEnergy submitted a follow-up to its
June 30, 2004 Certification and Report of Completion to NERC addressing the
minor exceptions, which are now essentially complete.

FirstEnergy is
proceeding with the implementation of the recommendations that were to be
completed subsequent to 2004 and will continue to periodically assess the
FERC-ordered Reliability Study recommendations for forecasted 2009 system
conditions, recognizing revised load forecasts and other changing system
conditions which may impact the recommendations. Thus far, implementation of the
recommendations has not required, nor is expected to require, substantial
investment in new, or material upgrades, to existing equipment. FirstEnergy
notes, however, that FERC or other applicable government agencies and
reliability coordinators may take a different view as to recommended
enhancements or may recommend additional enhancements in the future that could
require additional, material expenditures. Finally, the PUCO is continuing to
review the FirstEnergy filing that addressed upgrades to control room computer
hardware and software and enhancements to the training of control room
operators, before determining the next steps, if any, in the proceeding.

On July 5,
2003, JCP&L experienced a series of 34.5 kilovolt sub-transmission line
faults that resulted in outages on the New Jersey shore. On July 16, 2003,
the NJBPU initiated an investigation into the cause of JCP&L's outages of
the July 4, 2003 weekend. The NJBPU selected a Special Reliability Master
(SRM) to oversee and make recommendations on appropriate courses of action
necessary to ensure system-wide reliability. Additionally, pursuant to the
stipulation of settlement that was adopted in the NJBPU's Order of
March 13, 2003 in its docket relating to the investigation of outages in
August 2002, the NJBPU, through an independent auditor working under direction
of the NJBPU Staff, undertook a review and focused audit of JCP&L's Planning
and Operations and Maintenance programs and practices (Focused Audit).
Subsequent to the initial engagement of the auditor, the scope of the review was
expanded to include the outages during July 2003.

Both the
independent auditor and the SRM submitted interim reports primarily addressing
improvements to be made prior to the next occurrence of peak loads in the summer
of 2004. On December 17, 2003, the NJBPU adopted the SRM's interim
recommendations related to service reliability. With the assistance of the
independent auditor and the SRM, JCP&L and the NJBPU staff created a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that set out specific tasks to be performed by
JCP&L and a timetable for completion. On March 29, 2004, the NJBPU
adopted the MOU and endorsed JCP&L's ongoing actions to implement the MOU.
On June 9, 2004, the NJBPU approved a Stipulation that incorporates the
final report of the SRM and the Executive Summary and Recommendation portions of
the final report of the Operations Audit. A Final Order in the Focused Audit
docket was issued by the NJBPU on July 23, 2004. JCP&L continues to
file compliance reports reflecting activities associated with the MOU and
Stipulation.

In May 2004, the
PPUC issued an order approving the revised reliability benchmark and standards,
including revised benchmarks and standards for Met-Ed, Penelec and Penn. Met-Ed,
Penelec and Penn filed a Petition for Amendment of Benchmarks with the PPUC on
May 26, 2004 seeking amendment of the benchmarks and standards due to their
implementation of automated outage management systems following restructuring.
Evidentiary hearings have been scheduled for September 2005. FirstEnergy is
unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding.


On January 16,
2004, the PPUC initiated a formal investigation of whether Met-Ed's, Penelec's
and Penn's “service reliability performance deteriorated to a point below the
level of service reliability that existed prior to restructuring” in
Pennsylvania. Hearings were held in early August 2004. On September 30,
2004, Met-Ed, Penelec and Penn filed a settlement agreement with the PPUC that
addresses the issues related to this investigation. As part of the settlement,
Met-Ed, Penelec and Penn agreed to enhance service reliability, ongoing periodic
performance reporting and communications with customers and to collectively
maintain their current spending levels of at least $255 million annually on
combined capital and operation and maintenance expenditures for transmission and
distribution for the years 2005 through 2007. The settlement also outlines an
expedited remediation process to address any alleged non-compliance with terms
of the settlement and an expedited PPUC hearing process if remediation is
unsuccessful. O

n November 4,
2004, the PPUC accepted the recommendation of the ALJ approving the
settlement.

PUCO Rate
Matters

In October 2003,
the Ohio Companies filed an application for a Rate Stabilization Plan with the
PUCO to establish generation service rates beginning January 1, 2006, in
response to PUCO concerns about price and supply uncertainty following the end
of the Ohio Companies' transition plan market development period. On
February 24, 2004, the Ohio Companies filed a revised Rate Stabilization
Plan to address PUCO concerns related to the original Rate Stabilization Plan.
On June 9, 2004, the PUCO issued an order approving the revised Rate
Stabilization Plan, subject to conducting a competitive bid process. On
August 5, 2004, the Ohio Companies accepted the Rate Stabilization Plan as
modified and approved by the PUCO on August 4, 2004. In the second quarter
of 2004, the Ohio Companies implemented the accounting modifications related to
the extended amortization periods and interest costs deferral on the deferred
customer shopping incentive balances. On October 1 and October 4,
2004, the OCC and NOAC, respectively, filed appeals with the Supreme Court of
Ohio to overturn the June 9, 2004 PUCO order and associated entries on
rehearing.

The revised Rate
Stabilization Plan extends current generation prices through 2008, ensuring
adequate generation supply at stabilized prices, and continues the Ohio
Companies' support of energy efficiency and economic development efforts. Other
key components of the revised Rate Stabilization Plan include the
following:

On December 9,
2004, the PUCO rejected the auction price results from a required competitive
bid process and issued an entry stating that the pricing under the approved
revised Rate Stabilization Plan will take effect on January 1, 2006. The
PUCO may cause the Ohio Companies to undertake, no more often than annually, a
similar competitive bid process to secure generation for the years 2007 and
2008. Any acceptance of future competitive bid results would terminate the Rate
Stabilization Plan pricing, but not the related approved accounting, and not
until twelve months after the PUCO authorizes such termination.

NJBPU Rate
Matters

JCP&L is
permitted to defer for future collection from customers the amounts by which its
costs of supplying BGS to non-shopping customers and costs incurred under NUG
agreements exceed amounts collected through BGS and MTC rates. As of
December 31, 2004, the accumulated deferred cost balance totaled
approximately $446 million. New Jersey law allows for securitization of
JCP&L's deferred balance upon application by JCP&L and a determination
by the NJBPU that the conditions of the New Jersey restructuring legislation are
met. On February 14, 2003, JCP&L filed for approval of the
securitization of the deferred balance. There can be no assurance as to the
extent, if any, that the NJBPU will permit such securitization.


In July  2003,
the NJBPU announced its JCP&L base electric rate proceeding decision, which
reduced JCP&L's annual revenues effective August 1, 2003 and disallowed
$153 million of deferred energy costs. The NJBPU decision also provided for an
interim return on equity of 9.5% on JCP&L's rate base. The decision ordered
a Phase II proceeding be conducted to review whether JCP&L is in compliance
with current service reliability and quality standards. The BPU also ordered
that any expenditures and projects undertaken by JCP&L to increase its
system's reliability will be reviewed as part of the Phase II proceeding, to
determine their prudence and reasonableness for rate recovery. In that Phase II
proceeding, the NJBPU could increase JCP&L’s return on equity to 9.75% or
decrease it to 9.25%, depending on its assessment of the reliability of
JCP&L's service. Any reduction would be retroactive to August 1, 2003.
JCP&L recorded charges to net income for the year ended December 31,
2003, aggregating $185 million ($109 million net of tax) consisting of the $153
million of disallowed deferred energy costs and $32 million of other disallowed
regulatory assets. In its final decision and order issued on May 17, 2004,
the NJPBU clarified the method for calculating interest attributable to the cost
disallowances, resulting in a $5.4 million reduction from the amount estimated
in 2003. JCP&L filed an August 15, 2003 interim motion for rehearing
and reconsideration with the NJBPU and a June 1, 2004 supplemental and
amended motion for rehearing and reconsideration. On July 7, 2004, the
NJBPU granted limited reconsideration and rehearing on the following issues: (1)
deferred cost disallowances, (2) the capital structure including the rate of
return, (3) merger savings, including amortization of costs to achieve merger
savings; and (4) decommissioning costs. Management is unable to predict when a
decision may be reached by the NJBPU.

On July 16,
2004, JCP&L filed the Phase II petition and testimony with the NJBPU,
requesting an increase in base rates of $36 million for the recovery of system
reliability costs and a 9.75% return on equity. The filing also requests an
increase to the MTC deferred balance recovery of approximately $20 million
annually. The Ratepayer Advocate filed testimony on November 16, 2004 and
JCP&L submitted rebuttal testimony on January 4, 2005. Settlement
conferences are ongoing.

JCP&L sells all
self-supplied energy (NUGs and owned generation) to the wholesale market with
offsetting credits to its deferred energy balance with the exception of 300 MW
from JCP&L's NUG committed supply currently being used to serve BGS
customers pursuant to NJBPU order. The BGS auction for periods beginning
June 1, 2004 was completed in February 2004 and new BGS tariffs
reflecting the auction results became effective June 1, 2004. The NJBPU
decision on the BGS post transition year three process was announced on
October 22, 2004, approving with minor modifications the BGS procurement
process filed by JCP&L and the other New Jersey electric distribution
companies and authorizing the continued use of NUG committed supply to serve 300
MW of BGS load. The auction for the supply period beginning June 1, 2005
was completed in February 2005.

In accordance with
an April 28, 2004 NJBPU order, JCP&L filed testimony on June 7,
2004 supporting a continuation of the current level and duration of the funding
of TMI-2 decommissioning costs by New Jersey customers without a reduction,
termination or capping of the funding. On September 30, 2004, JCP&L
filed an updated TMI-2 decommissioning study (see Exhibit 13, Note 11 - Asset
Retirement Obligations). This study resulted in an updated total decommissioning
cost estimate of $729 million (in 2003 dollars) compared to the estimated $528
million (in 2003 dollars) from the prior 1995 decommissioning study. The
Ratepayer Advocate filed comments on February 28, 2008. A schedule for further
proceedings has not yet been set.

In response to the
ongoing work stoppage by the members of IBEW System Council U-3, the NJBPU has
made inquiries of JCP&L regarding its preparedness to assure service
reliability and respond to storm or other emergency conditions during the
strike. JCP&L has responded to these inquiries and has provided the
requested information.

PPUC Rate
Matters

In June 2001, the
PPUC approved the Settlement Stipulation with all of the major parties in the
combined merger and rate relief proceedings, which approved the FirstEnergy/GPU
merger and provided Met-Ed and Penelec PLR deferred accounting treatment for
energy costs. A February 2002 Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania decision
affirmed the PPUC decision regarding approval of the merger, remanded the issues
of quantification and allocation of merger savings to the PPUC and denied the
PLR deferral accounting treatment. In October 2003, the PPUC issued an order
concluding that the Commonwealth Court reversed the PPUC’s June  2001 order
in its entirety. In accordance with the PPUC's direction, Met-Ed and Penelec
filed supplements to their tariffs which were effective October 2003 that
reflected the CTC rates and shopping credits in effect prior to the
June 21, 2001 order.

In response to its
October 8, 2003 petition, the PPUC approved June 30, 2004 as the date
for Met-Ed's and Penelec's NUG trust fund refunds and denied their accounting
request regarding the CTC rate/shopping credit swap by requiring Met-Ed and
Penelec to treat the stipulated CTC rates that were in effect from
January 1, 2002 on a retroactive basis. Met-Ed and Penelec subsequently
filed with the Commonwealth Court, on October 31, 2003, an Application for
Clarification with the judge, a Petition for Review of the PPUC's October 2
and October 16 Orders, and an application for reargument if the judge, in
his clarification order, indicates that Met-Ed's and Penelec's Objection was
intended to be denied on the merits. The Reargument Brief before the
Commonwealth Court was filed January 28, 2005.


In accordance with
PPUC directives, Met-Ed and Penelec have been negotiating with interested
parties in an attempt to resolve the merger savings issues that are the subject
of remand from the Commonwealth Court. These companies' combined portion of
total merger savings is estimated at approximately $31.5 million. If no
settlement can be reached, Met-Ed and Penelec will take the position that any
portion of such savings should be allocated to customers during each company's
next rate proceeding.

Met-Ed and Penelec
purchase a portion of their PLR requirements from FES through a wholesale power
sale agreement. The PLR sale is automatically extended for each successive
calendar year unless any party elects to cancel the agreement by November 1
of the preceding year. Under the terms of the wholesale agreement, FES retains
the supply obligation and the supply profit and loss risk, for the portion of
power supply requirements not self-supplied by Met-Ed and Penelec under their
NUG contracts and other power contracts with nonaffiliated third party
suppliers. This arrangement reduces Met-Ed's and Penelec's exposure to high
wholesale power prices by providing power at a fixed price for their uncommitted
PLR energy costs during the term of the agreement with FES. Met-Ed and Penelec
are authorized to continue deferring differences between NUG contract costs and
current market prices.

Transmission
Rate Matters

On November 1,
2004, ATSI requested authority from the FERC to defer approximately $54 million
of vegetation management costs ($13 deferred as of December 31, 2004
pending authorization) estimated to be incurred from 2004 through 2007. The FERC
issued an order granting approval of the deferral on March 2, 2005.

ATSI and MISO filed
with the FERC on December 2, 2004, seeking approval for ATSI to have
transmission rates established based on a FERC-approved cost of service formula
rate included in Attachment O under the MISO tariff. The ATSI Network Service
net revenue requirement increased under the formula rate to approximately $159
million. On January 28, 2005, the FERC accepted for filing the revised
tariff sheets to become effective February 1, 2005, subject to refund, and
ordered a public hearing be held to address the reasonableness of the proposal
to eliminate the voltage-differentiated rate design for the ATSI
zone.

On December 
30, 2004, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO seeking tariff
adjustments to recover increases of approximately $30 million in transmission
and ancillary service-related costs beginning January 1, 2006. The Ohio
Companies also filed an application for authority to defer costs such as those
associated with MISO Day 1, MISO Day 2, congestion fees, FERC assessment
fees, and the ATSI rate increase, as applicable, from October 1, 2003
through December 31, 2005.

On January 12,
2005, Met-Ed and Penelec filed, before the PPUC, a request for deferral of
transmission-related costs beginning January 1, 2005, estimated to be
approximately $8 million per month.

On September 16,
2004, the FERC issued an order that imposed additional obligations on CEI under
certain pre-Open Access transmission contracts among CEI and the cities of
Cleveland and Painesville. Under the FERC’s decision, CEI may be responsible for
a portion of new energy market charges imposed by MISO when its energy markets
begin in the spring of 2005. CEI filed for rehearing of the order from the FERC
on October 18, 2004. The impact of the FERC decision on CEI is dependent upon
many factors, including the arrangements made by the cities for transmission
service, the startup date for the MISO energy market, and the resolution of the
rehearing request, and cannot be determined at this time.

PJM and MISO were
ordered by the FERC to develop a common market between the regions by
October 31, 2004. The FERC also initiated a Section 206 investigation into
the reasonableness of the “through-and-out” transmission rates charged by PJM
and MISO. By order issued November 17, 2003, as modified by subsequent
orders, MISO, PJM, and certain unaffiliated transmission owners in the Midwest
were directed to eliminate rates for point-to-point service between the two RTOs
effective December 1, 2004. On October 1, 2004, proponents of a Regional
Pricing Plan and a Unified Plan filed competing proposals for FERC’s
consideration. Protests and reply comments were filed with the FERC. On
November 18, 2004, FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the
Regional Pricing Plan and directing compliance filings by MISO and PJM. On
November 24, 2004, compliance filings were submitted to FERC that proposed
surcharges for collection of lost revenues in both MISO and PJM for
December 1, 2004 through March 31, 2006. Numerous parties protested
the proposed surcharges on January 7, 2005. On February 10, 2005, FERC
issued an order setting the case for hearing. The outcome of this proceeding
cannot be predicted.


On January 31,
2005, certain PJM transmission owners made filings pursuant to a settlement
agreement approved by FERC in Docket ER04-156-000. JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec
were parties to that proceeding. Three filings were made. First, the settling
transmission owners submitted a filing justifying continuation of their existing
“license plate” rate design within the PJM RTO. Second, the settling
transmission owners proposed a revised Schedule 12 to the PJM Tariff designed to
harmonize the rate treatment of new and existing transmission facilities.
Finally, Baltimore Gas & Electric Company and certain public utility
affiliates of PEPCO Holdings, Inc. made a filing to implement a transmission
cost of service formula rate for their load zones within PJM. JCP&L, Met-Ed
and Penelec did not join in this filing. Interventions and protests were due on
these filings in late February, and we expect the FERC to act in late March 2005
on the filings.

On August 6,
2004, FERC issued an order conditionally approving the MISO’s proposed energy
market tariff effective March 1, 2005. FERC affirmed this order on
rehearing on November 6, 2004. The implementation of MISO’s energy market
is subject to successful completion of market test runs and approval of certain
compliance filings. On January 27, 2005, MISO announced that financially
binding market activities would be postponed until April 1, 2005 to permit
additional testing of systems and training. FirstEnergy affiliates have been
certified as market participants and will participate in the MISO markets when
they begin operation.

CEI has an
additional $21 million due to associated companies in 2006-2007.

The Companies’ and
FES's respective investments for additional nuclear fuel, and nuclear fuel
investment reductions as the fuel is consumed, during the 2005-2007 period are
presented in the following table. The table also displays the Companies’
operating lease commitments, net of capital trust cash receipts for the
2005-2007 period.


Short-term
borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2004, consisted of
$29 million of bank borrowings (OE - $25 million and HVACs - $4 million),
and $142 million of OES Capital, Incorporated. OES Capital is a wholly
owned subsidiary of OE whose borrowings are secured by customer accounts
receivable purchased from OE. OES Capital can borrow up to $170 million
under a receivables financing agreement at rates based on certain bank
commercial paper. FirstEnergy and OE had $1.4 billion available under $1.75
billion of revolving lines of credit as of December 31, 2004. FirstEnergy
may borrow under these facilities and could transfer any of its borrowings to
its subsidiaries. These revolving credit facilities, combined with an aggregate
$550 million of accounts receivable financing facilities for OE, CEI, TE,
Met-Ed, Penelec and Penn, are intended to provide liquidity to meet our
short-term working capital requirements and those of our subsidiaries. Total
unused borrowing capability under existing facilities and accounts receivable
financing facilities totaled $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2004. An
additional source of ongoing cash for FirstEnergy, as a holding company, is cash
dividends from its subsidiaries. In 2004, the holding company received $782
million of cash dividends on common stock from its subsidiaries.

Based on their
present plans, the Companies could provide for their cash requirements in 2005
from the following sources: funds to be received from operations; available cash
and temporary cash investments as of December 31, 2004 (Company’s
nonutility subsidiaries - $51 million, and OE - $1 million); the
issuance of long-term debt (for refunding purposes); and funds available under
revolving credit arrangements.

The extent and type
of future financings will depend on the need for external funds as well as
market conditions, the maintenance of an appropriate capital structure and the
ability of the Companies to comply with coverage requirements in order to issue
FMB and preferred stock. The Companies will continue to monitor financial market
conditions and, where appropriate, may take advantage of economic opportunities
to refund debt and preferred stock to the extent that their financial resources
permit.

The coverage
requirements contained in the first mortgage indentures under which the
Companies issue FMB provide that, except for certain refunding purposes, the
Companies may not issue FMB unless applicable net earnings (before income
taxes), calculated as provided in the indentures, for any period of twelve
consecutive months within the fifteen calendar months preceding the month in
which such additional bonds are issued, are at least twice annual interest
requirements on outstanding FMB, including those being issued. At the end of
2004, the Ohio Companies and Penn had the aggregate capability to issue
approximately $4.4 billion of additional FMB on the basis of property additions
and retired bonds under the terms of their respective mortgage indentures. The
issuance of FMB by OE and CEI are also subject to provisions of their senior
note indentures generally limiting the incurrence of additional secured debt,
subject to certain exceptions that would permit, among other things, the
issuance of secured debt (including FMB) (i) supporting pollution control notes
or similar obligations, or (ii) as an extension, renewal or replacement of
previously outstanding secured debt. In addition, these provisions would permit
OE and CEI to incur additional secured debt not otherwise permitted by a
specified exception of up to $641 million and $588 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2004. Under the provisions of its senior note indenture,
JCP&L may issue additional FMB only as collateral for senior notes. As of
December 31, 2004, JCP&L had the capability to issue $644 million of
additional senior notes upon the basis of FMB collateral.

OE’s, Penn’s, TE’s
and JCP&L's respective articles of incorporation prohibit the sale of
preferred stock unless applicable gross income, calculated as provided in the
articles of incorporation, is equal to at least 1-1/2 times the aggregate of the
annual interest requirements on indebtedness and annual dividend requirements on
preferred stock outstanding immediately thereafter. Based upon applicable
earnings coverage tests in their respective charters, OE, Penn, TE and JCP&L
could issue a total of $4.5 billion of preferred stock (assuming no additional
debt was issued) as of the end of 2004. CEI, Met-Ed and Penelec have no
restrictions on the issuance of preferred stock.


To the extent that
coverage requirements or market conditions restrict the Companies’ abilities to
issue desired amounts of FMB or preferred stock, the Companies may seek other
methods of financing. Such financings could include the sale of preferred and/or
preference stock or of such other types of securities as might be authorized by
applicable regulatory authorities which would not otherwise be sold and could
result in annual interest charges and/or dividend requirements in excess of
those that would otherwise be incurred.

As of
December 31, 2004, approximately $1.0 billion was remaining under
FirstEnergy's shelf registration statement, filed with the SEC in 2003, to
support future securities issues. The shelf registration provides the
flexibility to issue and sell various types of securities, including common
stock, debt securities, and share purchase contracts and related share purchase
units.

Nuclear
Regulation

The construction,
operation and decommissioning of nuclear generating units are subject to the
regulatory jurisdiction of the NRC including the issuance by it of construction
permits, operating licenses, and possession only licenses for decommissioning
reactors. The NRC's procedures with respect to the amendment of nuclear reactor
operating licenses afford opportunities for interested parties to request
adjudicatory hearings on health, safety and environmental issues subject to
meeting NRC "standing" requirements. The NRC may require substantial changes in
operation or the installation of additional equipment to meet safety or
environmental standards, subject to the backfit rule requiring the NRC to
justify such new requirements as necessary for the overall protection of public
health and safety. The possibility also exists for modification, denial or
revocation of licenses. As a result of the merger with GPU, FirstEnergy now owns
the TMI-2 and the Saxton Nuclear Experimental Facility. Both facilities are in
various stages of decommissioning. TMI-2 is in a post-defueling monitored
storage condition, with decommissioning planned in 2014, absent an extension of
the operating license to the owner of TMI-1. Saxton is in the final stages of
decommissioning, with license termination and final site restoration scheduled
for the third quarter of 2005. Beaver Valley Unit 1 was placed in commercial
operation in 1976, and its operating license expires in 2016. Davis-Besse was
placed in commercial operation in 1977, and its operating license expires in
2017. Perry Unit 1 and Beaver Valley Unit 2 were placed in commercial operation
in 1987, and their operating licenses expire in 2026 and 2027, respectively.
FirstEnergy submitted a license renewal application with the NRC seeking to
extend the operation of Beaver Valley Units 1 and 2 to 2036 and 2047,
respectively.

Davis-Besse, which
is operated by FENOC, began its scheduled refueling outage on February 16,
2002. The plant was originally scheduled to return to service by the end of
March 2002. During the refueling outage, FENOC found corrosion in the reactor
vessel head near some of the control rod drive mechanism penetration nozzles,
created by boric acid deposits from leaks in the nozzles. As a result, the NRC
issued a confirmatory action letter stating that restart of the plant would be
subject to prior NRC approval, and it established an Inspection Manual Chapter
0350 Oversight Panel to ensure close NRC oversight of Davis-Besse’s corrective
actions.

On March 8,
2004, FENOC received NRC authorization to restart Davis-Besse and the plant
achieved full power on April 4, 2004.

The NRC granted
restart authorization in an order containing several commitments for
Davis-Besse. Those requirements include ongoing independent assessments of the
site’s operational performance, safety culture and safety conscious work
environment, and corrective action and engineering programs for five years, as
well as visual inspection of the reactor head and lower vessel during the
plant’s mid-cycle outage, which took place in late January and early February of
2005.

In 2002, FENOC
spent approximately $115 million in additional nuclear-related operation and
maintenance costs, approximately $120 million in replacement power costs and
approximately $63 million in capital expenditures related to the reactor head
and restart. In 2003, FENOC spent approximately $93 million in additional
nuclear-related operation and maintenance costs, approximately $196 million in
replacement power costs and approximately $21 million in capital expenditures
related to the reactor head and restart. In 2004, FENOC spent approximately
$900,000 in additional nuclear-related operation and maintenance costs and
approximately $64 million in replacement power costs during the remaining period
of the outage.


The NRC has
promulgated and continues to promulgate orders and regulations related to the
safe operation of nuclear power plants and standards for decommissioning
clean-up and final license termination. The Companies cannot predict what
additional orders and regulations (including post-September 11, 2001
security enhancements) may be promulgated, design changes required or the effect
that any such regulations or design changes or additional clean-up standards for
final site release, or the consideration thereof, may have upon their nuclear
plants. Although the Companies have no reason to anticipate an accident at any
of their nuclear plants, if such an accident did happen, it could have a
material but currently undeterminable adverse effect on FirstEnergy's
consolidated financial position. In addition, such an accident at any operating
nuclear plant, whether or not owned by the Companies, could result in
regulations or requirements that could affect the operation, licensing, or
decommissioning of plants that the Companies do own with a consequent but
currently undeterminable adverse impact, and could affect the Companies’
abilities to raise funds in the capital markets.

Nuclear
Insurance

The Price-Anderson
Act limits the public liability which can be assessed with respect to a nuclear
power plant to $10.8 billion (assuming 104 units licensed to operate)
for a single nuclear incident, which amount is covered by: (i) private
insurance amounting to $300 million; and (ii) $10.5 billion
provided by an industry retrospective rating plan required by the NRC pursuant
thereto. Under such retrospective rating plan, in the event of a nuclear
incident at any unit in the United States resulting in losses in excess of
private insurance, up to $100.6 million (but not more than $10 million
per unit per year in the event of more than one incident) must be contributed
for each nuclear unit licensed to operate in the country by the licensees
thereof to cover liabilities arising out of the incident. Based on their present
nuclear ownership and leasehold interests, the Companies’ maximum potential
assessment under these provisions would be $402.4 million
(OE-$107.5 million, Penn-$84.5 million, CEI-$121.4 million and
TE-$89.0 million) per incident but not more than $40.0 million
(OE-$10.7 million, Penn-$8.4 million, CEI-$12.1 million and
TE-$8.8 million) in any one year for each incident.

In addition to the
public liability insurance provided pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, the
Companies have also obtained insurance coverage in limited amounts for economic
loss and property damage arising out of nuclear incidents. The Companies are
members of NEIL which provides coverage (NEIL I) for the extra expense of
replacement power incurred due to prolonged accidental outages of nuclear units.
Under NEIL I, the Companies have policies, renewable yearly, corresponding
to their respective nuclear interests, which provide an aggregate indemnity of
up to approximately $1.488 billion (OE-$397.2 million,
Penn-$280.1 million, CEI-$478.9 million and TE-$332.1 million)
for replacement power costs incurred during an outage after an initial 20-week
waiting period. Members of NEIL I pay annual premiums and are subject to
assessments if losses exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer. The
Companies’ present maximum aggregate assessment for incidents at any covered
nuclear facility occurring during a policy year would be approximately
$10.4 million (OE-$2.8 million, Penn-$2.0 million,
CEI-$3.3 million and TE-$2.3 million).

The Companies are
insured as to their respective nuclear interests under property damage insurance
provided by NEIL to the operating company for each plant. Under these
arrangements, $2.75 billion of coverage for decontamination costs,
decommissioning costs, debris removal and repair and/or replacement of property
is provided. The Companies pay annual premiums for this coverage and are liable
for retrospective assessments of up to approximately $57.1 million
(OE-$16.0 million, Penn-$11.2 million, CEI-$17.5 million,
TE-$11.6 million, JCP&L-$0.2 million, Met-Ed-$0.4 million and
Penelec-$0.2 million) during a policy year. On September 30, 2003, CEI and TE
tendered Proofs of Loss under the Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL)
Property Damage and Accidental Outage Policies for the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power
Station related to an outage that began in 2002 at that station. The property
damage losses claimed by CEI and TE total $77.9 million and the Accidental
Outage losses claimed by CEI and TE total $106.7 million. On December 18, 2004,
NEIL denied CEI’s and TE’s claims. CEI and TE are considering their options with
respect to pursuing an arbitration of this matter.

The Companies
intend to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as described above as long as
it is available. To the extent that replacement power, property damage,
decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement costs and other such
costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of the Companies’ plants exceed the
policy limits of the insurance in effect with respect to that plant, to the
extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be covered by the Companies’
insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance becomes unavailable in the
future, the Companies would remain at risk for such costs.


The NRC requires
nuclear power plant licensees to obtain minimum property insurance coverage of
$1.06 billion or the amount generally available from private sources,
whichever is less. The proceeds of this insurance are required to be used first
to ensure that the licensed reactor is in a safe and stable condition and can be
maintained in that condition so as to prevent any significant risk to the public
health and safety. Within 30 days of stabilization, the licensee is
required to prepare and submit to the NRC a cleanup plan for approval. The plan
is required to identify all cleanup operations necessary to decontaminate the
reactor sufficiently to permit the resumption of operations or to commence
decommissioning. Any property insurance proceeds not already expended to place
the reactor in a safe and stable condition must be used first to complete those
decontamination operations that are ordered by the NRC. The Companies are unable
to predict what effect these requirements may have on the availability of
insurance proceeds to the Companies for the Companies’ bondholders.

Environmental
Matters

Various federal,
state and local authorities regulate the Companies with regard to air and water
quality and other environmental matters. The effects of compliance on the
Companies with regard to environmental matters could have a material adverse
effect on FirstEnergy's earnings and competitive position. These environmental
regulations affect FirstEnergy's earnings and competitive position to the extent
that it competes with companies that are not subject to such regulations and
therefore do not bear the risk of costs associated with compliance, or failure
to comply, with such regulations. Overall, FirstEnergy believes it is in
compliance with existing regulations but is unable to predict future change in
regulatory policies and what, if any, the effects of such change would be.
FirstEnergy estimates additional capital expenditures for environmental
compliance of approximately $430 million for 2005 through 2007, which is
included in the $3.3 billion of forecasted capital expenditures for 2005 through
2007.

Clean Air Act
Compliance

The Companies are
required to meet federally approved SO


regulations.
Violations of such regulations can result in shutdown of the generating unit
involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to $32,500 for each day the
unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim enforcement policy for
SO


regulations in
Ohio that allows for compliance based on a 30-day averaging period. The
Companies cannot predict what action the EPA may take in the future with respect
to the interim enforcement policy.

The Companies
believe they are complying with SO


reduction
requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 by burning lower-sulfur
fuel, generating more electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using
emission allowances. NO

x

reductions
required by the 1990 Amendments are being achieved through combustion controls
and the generation of more electricity at lower-emitting plants. In September
1998, the EPA finalized regulations requiring additional NO

x

reductions from
the Companies' facilities. The EPA's NO

x

Transport Rule
imposes uniform reductions of NO

x

emissions (an
approximate 85 percent reduction in utility plant NO

x

emissions from
projected 2007 emissions) across a region of nineteen states (including
Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania) and the District of Columbia based
on a conclusion that such NO

x

emissions are
contributing significantly to ozone levels in the eastern United States. The
Companies believe their facilities are also complying with the NO

x

budgets
established under State Implementation Plans (SIPs) through combustion controls
and post-combustion controls, including Selective Catalytic Reduction and
Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction systems, and/or using emission
allowances.

National
Ambient Air Quality Standards

In July 1997, the
EPA promulgated changes in the NAAQS for ozone and proposed a new NAAQS for fine
particulate matter. On December 17, 2003, the EPA proposed the "Interstate
Air Quality Rule" covering a total of 29 states (including Michigan, New Jersey,
Ohio and Pennsylvania) and the District of Columbia based on proposed findings
that air pollution emissions from 29 eastern states and the District of Columbia
significantly contribute to nonattainment of the NAAQS for fine particles and/or
the "8-hour" ozone NAAQS in other states. The EPA has proposed the Interstate
Air Quality Rule to "cap-and-trade" NO

x

and SO


emissions in two
phases (Phase I in 2010 and Phase II in 2015). According to the EPA,
SO


emissions would be
reduced by approximately 3.6 million tons annually by 2010, across states
covered by the rule, with reductions ultimately reaching more than 5.5 million
tons annually. NO

x

emission
reductions would measure about 1.5 million tons in 2010 and 1.8 million tons in
2015. The future cost of compliance with these proposed regulations may be
substantial and will depend on whether and how they are ultimately implemented
by the states in which the Companies operate affected facilities.


Mercury
Emissions

In December 2000,
the EPA announced it would proceed with the development of regulations regarding
hazardous air pollutants from electric power plants, identifying mercury as the
hazardous air pollutant of greatest concern. On December 15, 2003, the EPA
proposed two different approaches to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired
power plants. The first approach would require plants to install controls known
as MACT based on the type of coal burned. According to the EPA, if implemented,
the MACT proposal would reduce nationwide mercury emissions from coal-fired
power plants by 14 tons to approximately 34 tons per year. The second approach
proposes a cap-and-trade program that would reduce mercury emissions in two
distinct phases. Initially, mercury emissions would be reduced by 2010 as a
"co-benefit" from implementation of SO


and NO

x

emission caps under the EPA's proposed Interstate Air Quality Rule. Phase II of
the mercury cap-and-trade program would be implemented in 2018 to cap nationwide
mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants at 15 tons per year. The EPA has
agreed to choose between these two options and issue a final rule by
March 15, 2005. The future cost of compliance with these regulations may be
substantial.

W. H. Sammis
Plant

In 1999 and 2000,
the EPA issued NOV or Compliance Orders to nine utilities covering 44 power
plants, including the W. H. Sammis Plant, which is owned by OE and Penn. In
addition, the U.S. Department of Justice filed eight civil complaints against
various investor-owned utilities, which included a complaint against OE and Penn
in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. These cases are
referred to as New Source Review cases. The NOV and complaint allege violations
of the Clean Air Act based on operation and maintenance of the W. H. Sammis
Plant dating back to 1984. The complaint requests permanent injunctive relief to
require the installation of "best available control technology" and civil
penalties of up to $27,500 per day of violation. On August 7, 2003, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio ruled that 11
projects undertaken at the W. H. Sammis Plant between 1984 and 1998 required
pre-construction permits under the Clean Air Act. The ruling concludes the
liability phase of the case, which deals with applicability of Prevention of
Significant Deterioration provisions of the Clean Air Act. The remedy phase of
the trial to address civil penalties and what, if any, actions should be taken
to further reduce emissions at the plant has been delayed without rescheduling
by the Court because the parties are engaged in meaningful settlement
negotiations. The Court indicated, in its August 2003 ruling, that the remedies
it "may consider and impose involved a much broader, equitable analysis,
requiring the Court to consider air quality, public health, economic impact, and
employment consequences. The Court may also consider the less than consistent
efforts of the EPA to apply and further enforce the Clean Air Act." The
potential penalties that may be imposed, as well as the capital expenditures
necessary to comply with substantive remedial measures that may be required,
could have a material adverse impact on FirstEnergy's, OE's and Penn's
respective financial condition and results of operations. While the parties are
engaged in meaningful settlement discussions, management is unable to predict
the ultimate outcome of this matter and no liability has been accrued as of
December 31, 2004.

Regulation of
Hazardous Waste

As a result of the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, and the Toxic
Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state hazardous waste regulations
have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel combustion waste products, such as
coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste disposal requirements pending the
EPA's evaluation of the need for future regulation. The EPA subsequently
determined that regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is unnecessary. In
April 2000, the EPA announced that it will develop national standards regulating
disposal of coal ash under its authority to regulate nonhazardous
waste.

The Companies have
been named as PRPs at waste disposal sites, which may require cleanup under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980.
Allegations of disposal of hazardous substances at historical sites and the
liability involved are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute; however,
federal law provides that all PRPs for a particular site are liable on a joint
and several basis. Therefore, environmental liabilities that are considered
probable have been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 2004, based on estimates of the total costs of cleanup, the
Companies' proportionate responsibility for such costs and the financial ability
of other nonaffiliated entities to pay. In addition, JCP&L has accrued
liabilities for environmental remediation of former manufactured gas plants in
New Jersey; those costs are being recovered by JCP&L through a
non-bypassable SBC. Included in Current Liabilities and Other Noncurrent
Liabilities are accrued liabilities aggregating approximately $65 million as of
December 31, 2004. The Companies accrue environmental liabilities only when
they conclude that it is probable that they have an obligation for such costs
and can reasonably determine the amount of such costs. Unasserted claims are
reflected in the Companies’ determination of environmental liabilities and are
accrued in the period that they are both probable and reasonably
estimable.


Climate
Change

In December 1997,
delegates to the United Nations' climate summit in Japan adopted an agreement,
the Kyoto Protocol (Protocol), to address global warming by reducing the amount
of man-made greenhouse gases emitted by developed countries by 5.2% from 1990
levels between 2008 and 2012. The United States signed the Protocol in 1998 but
it failed to receive the two-thirds vote of the United States Senate required
for ratification. However, the Bush administration has committed the United
States to a voluntary climate change strategy to reduce domestic greenhouse gas
intensity - the ratio of emissions to economic output - by 18 percent through
2012.

The Companies
cannot currently estimate the financial impact of climate change policies,
although the potential restrictions on CO


emissions could
require significant capital and other expenditures. However, the CO


emissions per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by the Companies is lower
than many regional competitors due to the Companies' diversified generation
sources which include low or non-CO


emitting gas-fired
and nuclear generators.

Clean Water
Act

Various water
quality regulations, the majority of which are the result of the federal Clean
Water Act and its amendments, apply to the Companies' plants. In addition, Ohio,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania have water quality standards applicable to the
Companies' operations. As provided in the Clean Water Act, authority to grant
federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System water discharge permits
can be assumed by a state. Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have assumed such
authority.

On
September 7, 2004, the EPA established new performance standards under
Clean Water Act Section 316(b) for reducing impacts on fish and shellfish from
cooling water intake structures at certain existing large electric generating
plants. The regulations call for reductions in impingement mortality, when
aquatic organisms are pinned against screens or other parts of a cooling water
intake system and entrainment, which occurs when aquatic species are drawn into
a facility's cooling water system. The Companies are conducting comprehensive
demonstration studies, due in 2008, to determine the operational measures,
equipment or restoration activities, if any, necessary for compliance by their
facilities with the performance standards. FirstEnergy is unable to predict the
outcome of such studies. Depending on the outcome of such studies, the future
cost of compliance with these standards may require material capital
expenditures.

Fuel
Supply

FirstEnergy
currently has long-term coal contracts to provide approximately 18.4 million
tons for the year 2005. The contracts are shared among the Companies based on
various economic considerations. This contract coal is produced primarily from
mines located in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Wyoming and West Virginia. The
contracts expire at various times through December 31, 2021.

The Companies
estimate their 2005 coal requirements to be approximately 22.4 million tons
(OE - 6.7 million, Penn - 7.7 million, CEI - 6.0
million, and TE - 2.0 million) to be met from the long-term contracts
discussed above and spot market purchases. See “Environmental Matters” for
factors pertaining to meeting environmental regulations affecting coal-fired
generating units.

CEI, TE, OE and
Penn have contracts for uranium material and conversion services through 2008.
The enrichment services are contracted for all of the enrichment requirements
for nuclear fuel through 2006. A portion of enrichment requirements is also
contracted through 2011. Fabrication services for fuel assemblies are contracted
for the next two reloads for Beaver Valley Unit 1, the next two reloads for
Beaver Valley Unit 2 (through approximately 2007 and 2006, respectively), the
next reload for Davis-Besse (through approximately 2006) and through the
operating license period for Perry (through approximately 2026). The Davis-Besse
fabrication contract also has an extension provision for services through the
current operating license period (about 2017). In addition to the existing
commitments, the Companies intend to make additional arrangements for the supply
of uranium and for the subsequent conversion, enrichment, fabrication, and waste
disposal services.


On-site spent fuel
storage facilities are expected to be adequate for Perry through 2011;
facilities at Beaver Valley Units 1 and 2 are expected to be adequate
through 2015 and 2008, respectively. With the plant modifications completed in
2002, Davis-Besse has adequate storage through the remainder of its current
operating license period. After current on-site storage capacity is exhausted,
additional storage capacity will have to be obtained either through plant
modifications, interim off-site disposal, or permanent waste disposal
facilities. The Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 provides for the
construction of facilities for the permanent disposal of high-level nuclear
wastes, including spent fuel from nuclear power plants operated by electric
utilities. CEI, TE, OE and Penn have contracts with the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) for the disposal of spent fuel for Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse and
Perry. On February 15, 2002, President Bush approved the DOE's
recommendation of Yucca Mountain for underground disposal of spent nuclear fuel
from nuclear power plants and high level waste from U.S. defense programs. The
approval by President Bush enables the process to proceed to the licensing
phase. Based on the DOE schedule published in the July 1999 Draft Environmental
Impact Statement, the Yucca Mountain Repository is currently projected to start
receiving spent fuel in 2010. The Repository is expected to be delayed further
as the result of an announced delay in submission of the license application.
The Companies intend to make additional arrangements for storage capacity as a
contingency for further delays with the DOE acceptance of spent fuel for
disposal past 2010.

System
Capacity and Reserves

The 2004 net
maximum hourly demand for each of the Companies was: OE-5,461 MW (including an
additional 273 MW of firm power sales under a contract which extends through
2005) on June 9, 2004; Penn-987 MW (including an additional 56 MW of firm
power sales under a contract which extends through 2005) on June 15, 2004;
CEI-4,126 MW on August 27, 2004; TE-2,032 MW on August 3, 2004;
JCP&L-5,457 MW on August 20, 2004; Met-Ed-2,548 MW on August 3, 2004;
and Penelec-2,830 MW on December 20, 2004. JCP&L's load was auctioned off in
the New Jersey BGS Auction, transferring the full 5,100 MW load obligation to
other parties for the supply period beginning June 1, 2005. FES participated in
the auction and won a segment of that load.

Based on existing
capacity plans, ongoing arrangements for firm purchase contracts, and
anticipated term power sales and purchases, FirstEnergy has sufficient supply
resources to meet load obligations. The current FirstEnergy capacity portfolio
contains 13,387 MW of owned generation and approximately 1,600 MW of long-term
purchases from NUGs.

Any remaining load
obligations will be met through a mix of multi-year forward purchases,
short-term forward purchases (less than one year) and spot market
purchases.

Regional
Reliability

The Ohio Companies
and Penn participate with 24 other electric companies operating in nine states
in ECAR, which was organized for the purpose of furthering the reliability of
bulk power supply in the area through coordination of the planning and operation
by the ECAR members of their bulk power supply facilities. The ECAR members have
established principles and procedures regarding matters affecting the
reliability of the bulk power supply within the ECAR region. Procedures have
been adopted regarding: i) the evaluation and simulated testing of systems’
performance; ii) the establishment of minimum levels of daily operating
reserves; iii) the development of a program regarding emergency procedures
during conditions of declining system frequency; and iv) the basis for
uniform rating of generating equipment.

The transmission
facilities of JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec are operated by PJM. PJM is the
organization responsible for the operation and control of the bulk electric
power system throughout major portions of five Mid-Atlantic states and the
District of Columbia. PJM is dedicated to meeting the reliability criteria and
standards of NERC and the Mid-Atlantic Area Council.


Competition

The Companies
compete with other utilities for intersystem bulk power sales and for sales to
municipalities and cooperatives. The Companies also compete with suppliers of
natural gas and other forms of energy in connection with their industrial and
commercial sales and in the home climate control market, both with respect to
new customers and conversions, and with all other suppliers of electricity. To
date, there has been no substantial cogeneration by the Companies’
customers.

As a result of
actions taken by state legislative bodies over the last few years, major changes
in the electric utility business are occurring in parts of the United States,
including Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania where FirstEnergy's utility
subsidiaries operate. These changes have resulted in fundamental alterations in
the way traditional integrated utilities and holding company systems, like
FirstEnergy, conduct their business. In accordance with the Ohio electric
utility restructuring law under which Ohio electric customers could begin
choosing their electric generation suppliers starting in January 2001,
FirstEnergy has further aligned its business units to accommodate its retail
strategy and participate in the competitive electricity marketplace in Ohio. The
organizational changes deal with the unbundling of electric utility services and
new ways of conducting business. FirstEnergy’s competitive segment participates
in deregulated energy markets in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
Michigan.

Competition in
Ohio’s electric generation began on January 1, 2001. FirstEnergy moved the
operation of the generation portion of its business to its competitive business
unit as reflected in its approved Ohio transition plan. The Companies continue
to provide generation services to regulated franchise customers who have not
chosen an alternative, competitive generation supplier, except in New Jersey
where JCP&L's obligation to provide BGS has been removed through a
transitional mechanism of auctioning the obligation (see "NJBPU Rate Matters").
In September 2002, Met-Ed and Penelec assigned their PLR responsibility to FES
through a wholesale power sale agreement. Under the terms of the wholesale
agreement, FES assumed the supply obligation and the supply profit and loss
risk, for the portion of power supply requirements not self-supplied by Met-Ed
and Penelec. The agreement will be automatically extended on an annual basis
unless any party elects to cancel the agreement by November 1 of the
preceding year (see "PPUC Rate Matters" for further discussion). The Ohio
Companies and Penn obtain their generation through power supply agreements with
FES.

Research
and Development

The Companies
participate in funding the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), which was
formed for the purpose of expanding electric research and development under the
voluntary sponsorship of the nation’s electric utility
industry - public, private and cooperative. Its goal is to mutually
benefit utilities and their customers by promoting the development of new and
improved technologies to help the utility industry meet present and future
electric energy needs in environmentally and economically acceptable ways. EPRI
conducts research on all aspects of electric power production and use, including
fuels, generation, delivery, energy management and conservation, environmental
effects and energy analysis. The major portion of EPRI research and development
projects is directed toward practical solutions and their applications to
problems currently facing the electric utility industry.

Penn, 1,155 for JCP&L, 490 for Met-Ed and 605 for Penelec) are covered by
collective bargaining agreements.

On December 8,
2004, employees represented by IBEW System Council U-3 began a strike against
JCP&L. JCP&L continues to utilize management, other non-union personnel
from around FirstEnergy's system and contractors to perform service reliability
and priority maintenance work while the union members are on strike. The labor
agreement between JCP&L and System Council U-3 originally expired on
October 31, 2003 but was extended several times and ultimately expired on
December 7, 2004. JCP&L and the leadership of System Council U-3
continue to negotiate in an attempt to reach a new agreement and end the work
stoppage. It is unknown when such an agreement will be reached or when the work
stoppage will end. On January 31, 2005, IBEW Local 245, ratified a three-year
contract agreement with TE, FENOC, and FGCO. On February 4, 2005, IBEW Local
272, representing approximately 350 employees of the Bruce Mansfield Plant,
ratified a three-year contract with FGCO.

      PROPERTIES

The Companies’
respective first mortgage indentures constitute, in the opinion of the
Companies’ counsel, direct first liens on substantially all of the respective
Companies’ physical property, subject only to excepted encumbrances, as defined
in the indentures. See “Leases” and “Capitalization” notes to the respective
financial statements for information concerning leases and financing
encumbrances affecting certain of the Companies’ properties.

The Companies own,
individually or together as tenants in common, and/or lease, the generating
units in service as of March 1, 2005, shown on the table
below.


Notes:

(a)

CEI’s
      interests consist of 1.68% owned and 28.60% leased and TE's interests are
      leased.

(b)

OE’s
      interests consist of 20.22% owned and 21.66% leased for Beaver Valley
      Unit 2; and 17.42% owned (representing portion leased from a wholly
      owned subsidiary of OE) and 12.58% leased for Perry.

(c)

TE’s
      interests consist of 1.65% owned and 18.26%
leased.


Prolonged outages
of existing generating units might make it necessary for the Companies,
depending upon the demand for electric service upon their system, to use to a
greater extent than otherwise, less efficient and less economic generating
units, or purchased power, and in some cases may require the reduction of load
during peak periods under the Companies’ interruptible programs, all to an
extent not presently determinable.

The Companies’
generating plants and load centers are connected by a transmission system
consisting of elements having various voltage ratings ranging from 23 kV to
500 kV. The Companies’ overhead and underground transmission lines
aggregate 14,978 pole miles.

The Companies’
electric distribution systems include 114,177  miles of overhead pole line
and underground conduit carrying primary, secondary and street lighting
circuits. They own substations with a total installed transformer capacity of
91,117,000 kilovolt-amperes.

The transmission
facilities that are owned and operated by ATSI also interconnect with those of
AEP, DPL, Duquesne, Allegheny, MEC and Penelec. The transmission facilities of
JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec are physically interconnected and are operated on
an integrated basis as part of the PJM RTO.

      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Each registrant’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated
such registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of the end
date covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the respective Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that such registrant’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective.


Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

, management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the registrants’ internal
control over financial reporting under the supervision of each registrant’s
chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based on that evaluation,
management concluded that the registrants’ internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004

.

Management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of the registrants’ internal control over
financial reporting, as of December 31, 2004, has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their reports included in each registrant’s 2004 Annual Report to
Stockholders and incorporated by reference hereto.

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

There were no
changes in the registrants’ internal controls over financial reporting during
the fourth quarter of 2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the registrants’ internal control over financial
reporting.

OTHER
      INFORMATION

Severance
Agreements

On February 15,
2005, in response to a shareholder proposal at the 2004 Annual Meeting that
received the affirmative vote of approximately 64 percent of the votes cast, the
Board of Directors adopted a new policy with respect to severance agreements.
The Board’s policy requires that any future severance agreement offered to any
FirstEnergy employee that would be triggered by a change in control of
FirstEnergy limit the multiplier of base salary and target short-term incentive
compensation to 2.99 times. The Board’s policy also requires that such severance
agreements only contain such other terms, conditions and provisions as may be
recommended by the Compensation Committee and approved by the independent
directors of the Board and, at the discretion of such independent directors,
approved by the shareholders. The Board’s policy also requires that the
Compensation Committee retain an independent third-party consultant to
periodically review the prevailing competitive practices concerning severance
agreements triggered by a change in control and report on such review to the
Board.

In accordance with
this policy, the Compensation Committee authorized, and FirstEnergy entered
into, separate severance agreements with Guy L. Pipitone, Mark T. Clark, Lynn M.
Cavalier and Richard R. Grigg on March 7, 2005, effective immediately. Severance
benefits are limited to 2.99 times base salary and target short-term incentive
compensation for Ms. Cavalier and Messrs. Clark and Grigg. Severance benefits
are limited to 2.0 times base salary and target short-term incentive
compensation for Mr. Pipitone. In addition, the Compensation Committee
recommended, and the Board approved, the following additional terms. With
respect to the retirement benefits of Ms. Cavalier and Messrs. Clark and Grigg,
(a) three years will be added to his or her age and service at termination, (b)
pension benefits will be calculated with the enhanced age and service, and (c)
benefits will be paid out no earlier than an adjusted age of 55. With regard to
health care, he or she will receive health care benefits on the same terms as an
active employee for three years. Lastly, with regard to life insurance, he or
she will receive life insurance benefits on the same terms as an active employee
for three years. Mr. Pipitone’s agreement provides that, in regard to retirement
plans, (a) two years will be added to his age and service at termination, (b)
pension benefits will be calculated with the enhanced age and service, and (c)
benefits will be paid out no earlier than an adjusted age of 55. In regard to
health care, he will receive health care benefits on the same terms as an active
employee for two years. Lastly, in regard to life insurance, he will receive
life insurance benefits on the same terms as an active employee for two
years.

Under the
agreements, a change in control includes the acquisition of the beneficial
ownership of 50 percent or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or
other voting stock of FirstEnergy, a change in the majority of the members of
the Board of Directors, or a reorganization, merger, or dissolution of
FirstEnergy. The agreements are intended to ensure that the individuals are free
from personal distractions in the context of a potential change in control, when
the Board needs the objective assessment and advice of these executives to
determine whether an offer is in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders. The principal severance benefits may be triggered when the
individual is terminated or resigns for good reason, which generally is defined
as a material change, following a change of control, inconsistent with the
individual’s previous job duties or compensation.

Under all of the
above severance agreements, the executive would be prohibited for two years from
working for or with competing entities after receiving severance benefits from
this change in control agreement.


FirstEnergy also
has in place separate severance agreements with Anthony J. Alexander, Richard H.
Marsh, Carole B. Snyder, and Leila L. Vespoli, in the form applicable to Ms.
Cavalier and Messrs. Clark and Grigg described above, except that such
agreements provide for a benefit equal to 2.99 times the sum of the individual’s
base salary plus the average of his or her annual incentive compensation awards
over the past three years. Additionally, in the case of Mr. Alexander, he is
eligible for the specified severance benefits if he resigns, for any reason,
during a 90-day period commencing 18 months following a change in control.
Because the agreements for Mr. Marsh, Ms. Vespoli, and Ms. Snyder do not become
effective until January 1, 2006, they remain covered under the severance
agreements that were previously in place for each of them through
December 31, 2005.

FirstEnergy also
has in place separate severance agreements with Kevin J. Keough and Kathryn W.
Dindo in the form applicable to Mr. Pipitone as described above, except that
such agreements provide for a benefit equal to 2.00 times the sum of the
individual’s base salary plus the average of his or her annual incentive
compensation awards over the past three years.

Executive
Bonus Plan

FirstEnergy adopted
an Executive Bonus Plan effective November 3, 2004. The plan was established for
the purpose of providing for the purchase of personal life insurance for
participants who are each deemed to be a member of a select group of highly
compensated and/or management employees of FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries. The
plan is part of an integrated executive compensation program that is intended to
attract, retain and motivate certain key executives who are in a position to
make significant contributions to the operation and profitability of FirstEnergy
for the benefit of stockholders and customers. Employees of FirstEnergy and its
subsidiaries who are or become subject to the provisions of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and are designated by the CEO or, in the
case of the CEO, by the Compensation Committee of the Board, are eligible to
participate in the Plan.

Policies under the
plan will insure the participant’s life and shall provide a death benefit equal
to the participant’s annual base salary as of a specified date.

A copy of the plan
was filed as an exhibit to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 2004.

Section
      16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance - OE, Penn, CEI, TE,
      JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec

Prior to February
2005, FirstEnergy and OE, Penn, CEI, TE, JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec (the
“Reporting Subsidiaries”) recommended to persons who were insiders of both
FirstEnergy and a Reporting Subsidiary or Reporting Subsidiaries that single
insider reports be filed with respect to FirstEnergy and the Reporting
Subsidiaries rather than separate reports for each. This position was based in
part on an instruction to the insider reporting forms that applies in the case
of registered public utility holding companies. Insiders of FirstEnergy and the
Reporting Subsidiaries filed Forms 3 in this manner and further, did not set
forth information about any Reporting Subsidiary on grounds that they had no
holdings of any such issuer.

It recently came to
FirstEnergy’s attention that there is a difference of opinion as to the proper
method of reporting where a subsidiary of a registered public utility holding
company has equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (as do the Reporting Subsidiaries). SEC guidance in this area is unclear,
and industry practice varies. After further review, FirstEnergy and the
Reporting Subsidiaries determined to recommend that their insiders follow a more
conservative approach and file separate reports for each Reporting
Subsidiary.

Accordingly, in
March 2005, Forms 3 will be filed on behalf of the following insiders
in respect of the Reporting Subsidiaries indicated: Richard H. Marsh, Leila L.
Vespoli, Charles E. Jones, Harvey L. Wagner, Thomas C. Navin, in each case, for
all of the Reporting Subsidiaries: Anthony J. Alexander and Richard R. Grigg, in
each case, for all of the Reporting Subsidiaries except JCP&L: Gelorma E.
Persson, Stanley C. Van Ness, Bradley S. Ewing, Mark A. Julian and Stephen E.
Morgan, in each case, for JCP&L; Kevin J. Keough, Thomas A. Clark
and Jeffrey A. Elser for OE, Ronald P. Lantzy for OE and Met-Ed;
Dennis E. Chack and Paul W. Allison for CEI; and James M. Murray and Charles H.
Krueger for TE. Although arguably these Forms are not required to be
filed at all particularly since the reporting persons have no holdings in
the Reporting Subsidiaries, the Reporting Subsidiaries nonetheless are reporting
these Forms 3 as having not yet been filed for purposes of this Report on Form
10-K.
