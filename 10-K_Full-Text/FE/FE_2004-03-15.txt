ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

The Company

          FirstEnergy Corp. was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio in

operating  subsidiaries,  Ohio  Edison  Company  (OE),  The  Cleveland  Electric
Illuminating Company (CEI), Pennsylvania Power Company (Penn), The Toledo Edison
Company (TE), American Transmission Systems, Incorporated (ATSI), Jersey Central
Power  &  Light  Company  (JCP&L),  Metropolitan  Edison  Company  (Met-Ed)  and
Pennsylvania  Electric Company (Penelec).  These utility operating  subsidiaries
are  referred  to  throughout  as the  "Companies."  FirstEnergy's  consolidated
revenues are  primarily  derived from electric  service  provided by its utility
operating  subsidiaries  and the revenues of its other  principal  subsidiaries:
FirstEnergy  Solutions Corp. (FES);  FirstEnergy  Facilities Services Group, LLC
(FSG);  MYR Group Inc.  (MYR);  MARBEL Energy  Corporation  (MARBEL);  and First
Communications,  LLC.  In  addition,  FirstEnergy  holds all of the  outstanding
common stock of other direct  subsidiaries  including:  FirstEnergy  Properties,
Inc., FirstEnergy Ventures Corp., FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC),
FirstEnergy  Securities  Transfer Company,  GPU Diversified  Holdings,  LLC, GPU
Telecom  Services,  Inc., GPU Nuclear,  Inc.; and  FirstEnergy  Service  Company
(FESC).

          The Companies' combined service areas encompass  approximately  37,200
square miles in Ohio, New Jersey and  Pennsylvania.  The areas they serve have a
combined population of approximately 11.1 million.

          OE was organized  under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1930 and owns
property and does business as an electric  public utility in that state. OE also
has  ownership  interests  in  certain  generating  facilities  located  in  the
Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  (see Item 2 -  Properties).  OE  engages  in the
generation,  distribution  and sale of electric energy to communities in a 7,500
square mile area of central and northeastern  Ohio. OE also engages in the sale,
purchase and interchange of electric energy with other electric  companies.  The
area it serves has a population of approximately 2.7 million.

          OE owns all of Penn's  outstanding  common  stock.  Penn was organized
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1930 and owns property and
does  business  as an  electric  public  utility  in  that  state.  Penn is also
authorized  to do business and owns  property in the State of Ohio (see Item 2 -
Properties).  Penn furnishes  electric  service to communities in a 1,500 square
mile area of western  Pennsylvania.  The area served by Penn has a population of
approximately 0.3 million.

          CEI was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1892 and does
business  as an  electric  public  utility  in that  state.  CEI  engages in the
generation, distribution and sale of electric energy in an area of approximately
1,700 square miles in  northeastern  Ohio.  It also has  ownership  interests in
certain  generating  facilities in Pennsylvania  (see Item 2 - Properties).  CEI
also engages in the sale, purchase and interchange of electric energy with other
electric  companies.  The area CEI serves has a population of approximately  1.9
million.

          TE was organized  under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1901 and does
business  as an  electric  public  utility  in that  state.  TE  engages  in the
generation, distribution and sale of electric energy in an area of approximately
2,500  square  miles in  northwestern  Ohio.  It also has  interests  in certain
generating facilities in Pennsylvania and Michigan (see Item 2 - Properties). TE
also engages in the sale, purchase and interchange of electric energy with other
electric  companies.  The area TE serves has a population of  approximately  0.8
million.

          ATSI was organized  under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1998.  ATSI
owns  transmission  assets  that  were  formerly  owned by OE,  CEI and TE (Ohio
Companies) and Penn.  ATSI owns and operates  major,  high-voltage  transmission
facilities,  which  consist of  approximately  7,100  circuit  miles (5,778 pole
miles) of transmission lines with nominal voltages of 345 kilovolts (kV), 138 kV
and 69 kV. There are 37  interconnections  with six  neighboring  control areas.
ATSI's  transmission  system offers gateways into the East through high capacity
ties with  Pennsylvania-New  Jersey-Maryland  Interconnection  LLC (PJM) through
Penelec,  Duquesne  Light  Company and  Allegheny  Energy,  Inc.  into the North
through multiple 345 kV high capacity ties with Michigan  Electric  Coordination
Systems  (MEC),  and into the South  through ties with American  Electric  Power
Company, Inc. (AEP) and Dayton Power & Light Company (DPL). In addition, ATSI is
the control area operator for the Ohio  Companies and Penn service  areas.  ATSI
plans,  operates and maintains the  transmission  system in accordance  with the
requirements of the North American Electric  Reliability  Council and applicable
regulatory  agencies to ensure reliable service to FirstEnergy's  customers (see
FERC Rate  Matters  for a  discussion  of ATSI's  participation  in the  Midwest
Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO)).

Divestitures

     International Operations

          FirstEnergy  completed the  divestiture  of its  international  assets
subsequent  to December  31, 2003 with the sales of its  remaining  20.1 percent
interest  in Avon  (parent of  Midlands  Electricity  in the United  Kingdom) on
January 16, 2004,  and its 28.67  percent  interest in  Termobarranquilla  S.A.,
Empresa de Servicios Publicos (TEBSA) and other related subsidiaries in Colombia
on January 30, 2004. Avon, TEBSA and other international assets divested in 2003
and 2004 were  acquired as part of  FirstEnergy's  November 2001 merger with the
former GPU, Inc. As a result of these  transactions,  FirstEnergy  no longer has
ownership interests in international operating assets.

          The  divestiture  in 2003 of  international  operations in Bolivia and
Argentina included the sale of FirstEnergy's wholly owned subsidiary, Guaracachi
America,  Inc.,  a holding  company  with a 50.001  percent  interest in Empresa
Guaracachi S.A.  (EGSA),  on December 11, 2003, and its ownership in GPU Empresa
Distribuidora  Electrica  Regional S.A. (Emdersa) through the abandonment of its
shares in Emdersa's parent company,  GPU Argentina  Holdings,  Inc. on April 18,
2003.

          FirstEnergy  was  unsuccessful  in selling of GPU's  former  Argentina
operations  and  abandoned  its  interest in Emdersa in early 2003.  A number of
economic  events  occurred in Argentina that hindered  FirstEnergy's  ability to
realize  an  acceptable  value.  These  events  included  currency  devaluation,
restrictions on repatriation of cash, and the anticipation of future asset sales
in that region by competitors.  FirstEnergy  reflected Emdersa's 2002 results of
an after-tax loss of $87 million (including $109 million in currency transaction
losses arising  principally from U.S. dollar  denominated  debt) as discontinued
operations in the  Consolidated  Statement of Income for the year ended December
31, 2002. FirstEnergy also recognized a currency translation adjustment (CTA) of
$91 million in 2002 which reduced  FirstEnergy's  common  stockholders'  equity.
This  adjustment  represented  the  impact of  translating  Emdersa's  financial
statements  from its functional  currency to the U.S.  dollar for GAAP financial
reporting.  The abandonment  was  accomplished  by  relinquishing  FirstEnergy's
shares  to  the  independent  Board  of  Directors  of GPU  Argentina  Holdings,
relieving  FirstEnergy of all rights and obligations  relative to this business.
As a result of the  abandonment,  FirstEnergy  recognized  a one-time,  non-cash
charge of $67 million,  or $0.23 per share of common stock in the second quarter
of 2003.  This charge is the result of realizing the CTA losses through  current
period earnings ($90 million, or $0.30 per share),  partially offset by the gain
recognized from abandoning  FirstEnergy's investment in Emdersa ($23 million, or
$0.07 per share).  Since FirstEnergy had previously  recorded $90 million of CTA
adjustments  in Other  Comprehensive  Income  (OCI),  the net  effect of the $67
million charge was an increase in common stockholders' equity of $23 million.

          The $67 million after-tax charge in 2003 does not include the expected
income tax benefits related to the abandonment, which were fully reserved during
the second quarter of 2003.  FirstEnergy  expects tax benefits of  approximately
$129 million,  of which $50 million would increase net income in the period that
it becomes  probable those benefits will be realized.  The remaining $79 million
of tax  benefits  would  reduce  goodwill  recognized  in  connection  with  the
acquisition of GPU.

       Generation Assets

          In  November  2001,  FirstEnergy  reached  an  agreement  to sell four
coal-fired  power plants totaling 2,535 MW to NRG Energy Inc. On August 8, 2002,
FirstEnergy  notified NRG that it was canceling the agreement because NRG stated
that it could not  complete  the  transaction  under the  original  terms of the





agreement.  NRG filed voluntary bankruptcy  petitions in May 2003;  subsequently
FirstEnergy  reached an  agreement  for  settlement  of its claim  against  NRG.
FirstEnergy  sold its entire  claim  (including  $32  million  of cash  proceeds
received in December 2003) for $170 million in January 2004.

       Other Domestic Assets

          Other asset sales in 2003 included  three FSG  subsidiaries  - Ancoma,
Inc.,  a  mechanical  contracting  company  based in  Rochester,  New York,  and
Virginia-based Colonial Mechanical Corporation and Webb Technologies, Inc. - and
a MARBEL subsidiary - Northeast Ohio Natural Gas Company.

Risks Factors That May Affect Results

       Risks Related to Our Business

       FirstEnergy  May  Ultimately  Incur  Liability  in  Connection  with  the
       August 14, 2003 Regional Outage or the Restatement of Earnings

          On August 14, 2003,  various states in the northeast United States and
parts of southern Canada  experienced a widespread power outage,  which affected
approximately 1.4 million customers in FirstEnergy's  service area.  FirstEnergy
continues to accumulate  data and evaluate the status of its  electrical  system
prior to and  during the outage  event,  and  continues  to  cooperate  with the
U.S.-Canada  Power  System  Outage Task Force  (Task  Force)  investigating  the
outage.  The  interim  report  issued by the Task  Force on  November  18,  2003
concluded  that the  problems  leading up to the outage  began in  FirstEnergy's
service area.  Specifically,  the interim report concludes,  among other things,
that the initiation of the August 14th outage  resulted from the  coincidence on
that afternoon of the following causes: (1) inadequate  situational awareness at
FirstEnergy;  (2) FirstEnergy's  failure to adequately manage tree growth in its
transmission  rights  of  way;  and (3)  failure  of the  interconnected  grid's
reliability   organizations   (Midwest   Independent  System  Operator  and  PJM
Interconnection) to provide effective  diagnostic support.  FirstEnergy believes
that the interim report does not provide a complete and comprehensive picture of
the conditions  that  contributed to the August 14th outage and that it does not
adequately  address the underlying  causes of the outage.  FirstEnergy  believes
that the outage  cannot be explained by events on any one utility's  system.  On
March 1, 2004, the  FirstEnergy  companies  filed, in accordance with a November
25, 2003 order from the PUCO, its plan for addressing  certain issues identified
by the Task Force in its interim  report.  In particular,  the filing  addressed
upgrades to FENOC's control room computer hardware and software and enhancements
to the training of control room operators.  The PUCO, in  consultation  with the
North  American  Electric  Reliability  Council,  will  review  the plan  before
determining the next steps in the proceeding.  On December 24, 2003, the Federal
Energy  Regulatory   Commission  (FERC)  ordered   FirstEnergy  to  pay  for  an
independent study of part of Ohio's power grid. The study has commenced and will
examine the stability of the grid in critical points in the Cleveland and Akron,
Ohio areas;  the status of projected  power reserves  during summer 2004 through
2008; and the need for new transmission  lines or other grid projects.  The FERC
ordered the study to be completed  within 120 days. At this time, we do not know
how the results of the study will impact FirstEnergy.

          Various  legal  proceedings  have been filed  against  FirstEnergy  in
connection  with,  among other  things,  the  restatements  in August  2003,  by
FirstEnergy and its Ohio utility  subsidiaries of previously  reported  results,
the August 14th power outage  described  above,  and the extended  outage at the
Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station. Depending upon the particular proceeding, the
issues raised include alleged violations of federal securities laws, breaches of
fiduciary  duties under state law by  FirstEnergy  directors and  officers,  and
damages as a result of one or more of the noted  events.  The  securities  cases
have been  consolidated  into one action pending in federal court in Akron.  The
derivative  actions filed in federal court likewise have been  consolidated as a
separate  matter,  also in  federal  court in  Akron.  There  are  also  pending
derivative actions in state court.  FirstEnergy's Ohio utility subsidiaries also
were named as respondents in two regulatory  proceedings initiated at the Public
Utility Commission of Ohio (PUCO) in response to complaints  alleging failure to
provide  reasonable and adequate service stemming primarily from the August 14th
power outage.  FirstEnergy is vigorously  defending  these  actions,  but cannot
predict  the  outcome  of  any of  these  proceedings  or  whether  any  further
regulatory  proceedings  or legal  actions may be  instituted  against  them. In
particular, if FirstEnergy were ultimately determined to have legal liability in
connection with these  proceedings,  it could have a material  adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations.

          On September 11, 2003,  FirstEnergy  received an informal data request
from the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  asking it to  voluntarily
provide  information and documents related to the restatement of its 2002 annual
financial  statements.  We have  responded  to the  request,  but are  unable to
predict the  outcome of this or any of the other  pending  legal and  regulatory
proceedings discussed above.

       Changes  in  Commodity   Prices  Could   Decrease   Revenues  from  Power
       FirstEnergy Sells and Increase the Cost of Power We Buy

          While much of FirstEnergy's  generation  serves customers under retail
rates set by regulatory bodies, FirstEnergy also purchases and sells electricity




in the competitive wholesale and retail markets.  Increases in the costs of fuel
for the  generation  facilities  (particularly  coal and natural gas) can affect
FirstEnergy's  profit margins in both competitive and  non-competitive  markets.
Changes in the market  prices of  electricity,  which are affected by changes in
fuel costs and other factors,  may impact  FirstEnergy's  financial  results and
financial  position by increasing the amount  FirstEnergy pays to purchase power
to supply provider of last resort (PLR) obligations in Ohio and Pennsylvania.

          Electricity   and  fuel  prices  may  fluctuate   substantially   over
relatively short periods of time for a variety of reasons, including:

          o   severe or unexpected weather or seasonality;

          o   changes in electricity usage;

          o   illiquidity in wholesale power and other markets;

          o   transmission or transportation constraints, inoperability or
              inefficiencies;

          o   availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;

          o  changes in supply and demand for energy commodities;

          o   changes in power production capacity;

          o   outages at our power production facilities or those of our
              competitors;

          o   changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite,
              coal, crude oil and refined products;

          o   natural disasters, wars, acts of sabotage, terrorist acts,
              embargoes and other catastrophic events; and

          o   federal, state and local energy environmental and other regulation
              and legislation.

       FirstEnergy's  Facilities May Not Operate As Planned,  Which May Increase
       Expenses or Decrease  Revenues  and Have an Adverse  Effect on  Financial
       Performance

          Operation of power plants and  distribution  facilities  involves many
risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes,  accidents,
labor  disputes,   and   performance   below  expected   levels.   In  addition,
weather-related  incidents and other natural  disasters can disrupt  generation,
transmission   and  distribution   delivery   systems.   Because   FirstEnergy's
transmission  facilities are  interconnected  with those of third  parties,  the
operation  of  its  facilities  may  be  adversely  affected  by  unexpected  or
uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.

          Operation of FirstEnergy's power plants below expected capacity levels
could  result  in  lost  revenues  or  increased   expenses,   including  higher
maintenance  costs that it may not be able to recover from customers.  Unplanned
outages may require it to incur significant  replacement power costs.  Moreover,
if it were  unable  to  perform  under  contractual  obligations,  penalties  or
liability for damages may result.

       A Downgrade  in Credit  Ratings  Could  Negatively  Affect our Ability to
       Access Capital

          On December 23, 2003,  Standard & Poor's (S&P)  lowered its  corporate
credit ratings on FirstEnergy and its regulated  utility  subsidiaries to "BBB-"
from "BBB" and lowered  FirstEnergy's senior unsecured debt rating to "BB+" from
"BBB-".  Except for OE's senior secured issue rating,  which was left unchanged,
all other  subsidiary  ratings were lowered one notch as well.  The ratings were
removed from CreditWatch with negative implications,  where they had been placed
by S&P on August 18,  2003,  and the Ratings  Outlook  returned  to Stable.  The
rating  action  followed  a revision  in S&P's  assessment  of our  consolidated
business  risk  profile to `6' from `5' (`1'  equals low risk,  `10' equals high
risk),  with  S&P  citing  operational  and  management  challenges  as  well as
heightened  regulatory  uncertainty  for  its  revision  of  our  business  risk
assessment  score.  S&P's  rationale for its  revisions in our ratings  included
uncertainty  regarding  the  timing of the Ohio Rate Plan  filing  (see  Utility
Regulation),  the  pending  final  report on the  August  14th  power  outage as
previously  discussed,  the outcome of the remedial phase of litigation relating
to the Sammis plant (see Environmental  Matters),  and the extended  Davis-Besse
outage  and the  related  pending  subpoena  (see  Progress  Toward  Davis-Besse
Restart).  S&P further stated that the restart of  Davis-Besse  and a supportive
Ohio Rate Plan extension will be vital positive  developments  that would aid an
upgrade of  FirstEnergy's  ratings.  S&P's  reduction  of our credit  ratings in
December 2003 triggered cash and  letter-of-credit  collateral calls in addition
to higher interest rates for some outstanding borrowings.

          On February 6, 2004, Moody's  downgraded  FirstEnergy senior unsecured
debt to Baa3 from Baa2 and downgraded  the senior secured debt of JCP&L,  Met-Ed




and Penelec to Baa1 from A2. Moody's also  downgraded the preferred stock rating
of JCP&L to Ba1 from Baa2 and the  senior  unsecured  rating of  Penelec to Baa2
from A2. The ratings of OE, CEI, TE and Penn were  confirmed.  Moody's said that
the  lower  ratings  were  prompted  by:  "1) high  consolidated  leverage  with
significant  holding company debt, 2) a degree of regulatory  uncertainty in the
service  territories in which the company  operates,  3) risks  associated  with
investigations of the causes of the August 2003 blackout, and related securities
litigation,  and 4) a  narrowing  of  the  ratings  range  for  the  FirstEnergy
operating utilities,  given the degree to which FirstEnergy increasingly manages
the utilities as a single system and the significant financial interrelationship
among the subsidiaries."

       Risks Related to the Electric Utility Industry

       FirstEnergy  is Subject to Complex  and Changing  Government  Regulations
       that May Require  Increased  Expense and/or Changes in Business  Strategy
       that Could Have a Negative Impact on our Results of Operations

          FirstEnergy is subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal,
state and local regulatory agencies that significantly  influences our operating
environment.  FirstEnergy  is required to have numerous  permits,  approvals and
certificates from the agencies that regulate our business.  FirstEnergy believes
the necessary  permits,  approvals and  certificates  have been obtained for our
existing  operations  and that our  business is  conducted  in  accordance  with
applicable  laws;  however,  we are  unable to predict  the impact on  operating
results from future regulatory  activities of any of these agencies.  Changes in
or  reinterpretations  of existing laws or  regulations or the imposition of new
laws or regulations  could require  FirstEnergy to incur additional  expenses or
change the way we run our business,  and therefore have an adverse impact on our
results of operations.

       Restructuring  and  Deregulation  in the  Electric  Utility  Industry May
       Result in  Increased  Competition  and  Unrecoverable  Costs  that  Could
       Adversely Affect FirstEnergy's Business and Results of Operations

          As a result of the actions taken by state legislative  bodies over the
last few years, major changes in the electric utility business have occurred and
are  continuing  to take place in parts of the United  States,  including  Ohio,
Pennsylvania  and  New  Jersey.  These  changes  have  resulted  in  fundamental
alterations in the way integrated utilities conduct their business.

          Increased  competition resulting from restructuring efforts could have
a significant  adverse  financial impact on FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries and
consequently on their results of operations.  Increased competition could result
in  increased  pressure to lower  prices,  including  the price of  electricity.
Retail competition and the unbundling of regulated electric service could have a
significant  adverse  financial  impact  on us due to  potential  impairment  of
assets, a loss of retail  customers,  lower profit margins or increased costs of
capital. FirstEnergy cannot predict the extent and timing of entry by additional
competitors into the electric markets.

          The FERC and U.S. Congress are also proposing  significant  changes in
the structure and conduct of the electric utility industry. If the restructuring
and deregulation efforts result in increased competition or unrecoverable costs,
our business and results of operations  may be adversely  affected.  FirstEnergy
cannot  predict  the  extent  and  timing of  further  efforts  to  restructure,
deregulate or re-regulate FirstEnergy or the industry.

       FirstEnergy  is  Exposed to Risks of Nuclear  Generation,  Which  Involve
       Issues  and  Uncertainties  Relating  to Health  and  Safety,  Additional
       Capital  Costs,  the  Adequacy of Insurance  Coverage  and Nuclear  Plant
       Decommissioning

          FirstEnergy is subject to the risks of nuclear  generation,  including
but not limited to the following:

          o  the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health
             resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage,
             handling and disposal of radioactive materials;

          o  limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially
             available to cover losses that might arise in connection  with
             our nuclear operations or those of others in the United States;

          o  uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts
             if insurance coverage is inadequate; and

          o  uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial
             aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their
             licensed operation.

          The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose  licensing and
safety-related  requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.
In the event of  non-compliance,  the NRC has the  authority  to impose fines or
shut down a unit, or both,  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the
situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated




by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants,
including ours. Unlike our fossil plants, which have been leased to and operated
by FGCO since 2001, new capital costs as well as fuel, operation and maintenance
expenses for the nuclear plants continue to be borne by CEI, TE, OE and Penn.

          The Companies'  respective interests in nuclear facilities are insured
under Nuclear  Electric  Insurance  Limited,  or NEIL,  policies issued for each
plant. Under these policies, up to $2.75 billion is provided for property damage
and   decontamination   and   decommissioning   costs.  We  have  also  obtained
approximately $537 million of insurance coverage for replacement power costs for
The Companies' respective interests in nuclear facilities. Under these policies,
we can be assessed a maximum of approximately $29.1 million for incidents at any
covered nuclear  facility  occurring during a policy year which are in excess of
accumulated funds available to the insurer for paying losses.

       FirstEnergy's  Operating  Results are Affected by Weather  Conditions and
       May Fluctuate on a Seasonal and Quarterly Basis

          Weather  conditions  directly influence the demand for electric power.
In  FirstEnergy's  service  area,  demand for power peaks  during the hot summer
months,  with market  prices also  typically  peaking at that time. As a result,
overall  operating  results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly  basis. In
addition,  FirstEnergy  has  historically  sold  less  power,  and  consequently
received less revenue,  when weather conditions are milder. Severe weather, such
as tornadoes,  hurricanes,  storms and droughts,  may cause outages and property
damage  which may require  FirstEnergy  to incur  additional  expenses  that are
generally not insured and that may not be recoverable from customers. The effect
of the failure of FirstEnergy's  facilities to operate as planned,  as described
above, would be particularly burdensome during a peak demand period.

       FirstEnergy's   Costs  of   Compliance   with   Environmental   Laws  are
       Significant,  and the Cost of Compliance with Future  Environmental  Laws
       Could Harm Cash Flow and Profitability

          FirstEnergy's   subsidiaries'  operations  are  subject  to  extensive
federal,  state  and  local  environmental  statutes,   rules  and  regulations.
Compliance with these legal requirements  requires us to incur significant costs
toward  environmental  monitoring,  installation of pollution control equipment,
emission fees, maintenance,  upgrading, remediation and permitting at all of our
facilities.  These  expenditures  have  been  significant  in the  past  and may
increase in the future.  If the cost of compliance  with existing  environmental
regulations does increase, it could adversely affect FirstEnergy's  business and
results of operations,  financial position and cash flows. Moreover,  changes in
environmental laws may materially increase  FirstEnergy's costs of compliance or
accelerate the timing of capital  expenditures.  Because of the  deregulation of
generation,  FirstEnergy may not recover through rates additional costs incurred
for such compliance.  FirstEnergy's  compliance  strategy,  although  reasonably
based on  available  information,  may not  successfully  address  the  relevant
standards and interpretations in the future. If FirstEnergy fails to comply with
environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control
or new interpretations of longstanding requirements,  that failure may result in
the assessment of civil or criminal liability and fines.

Utility Regulation

          As a registered public utility holding company, FirstEnergy is subject
to regulation by the SEC under the Public  Utility  Holding  Company Act of 1935
(1935 Act). The SEC has determined that the electric facilities of the Companies
constitute a single  integrated public utility system under the standards of the
1935 Act. The 1935 Act regulates  FirstEnergy  with respect to  accounting,  the
issuance of securities,  the acquisition and sale of utility assets,  securities
or any other interest in any business,  and entering into, and  performance  of,
service,  sales and construction  contracts among its subsidiaries,  and certain
other  matters.  The 1935 Act also  limits the extent to which  FirstEnergy  may
engage in nonutility  businesses or acquire additional utility businesses.  Each
of the Companies'  retail rates,  conditions of service,  issuance of securities
and other  matters are subject to regulation in the state in which each operates
- - in Ohio by the PUCO, in New Jersey by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities
(NJBPU)  and in  Pennsylvania  by the  Pennsylvania  Public  Utility  Commission
(PPUC).  With respect to their wholesale and interstate  electric operations and
rates,  the Companies are subject to regulation,  including  regulation of their
accounting policies and practices,  by the FERC. Under Ohio law,  municipalities
may  regulate  rates,  subject  to appeal to the PUCO if not  acceptable  to the
utility.

          In Ohio,  New Jersey and  Pennsylvania,  laws  applicable  to electric
industry  deregulation  included  similar  provisions which are reflected in the
Companies' respective state regulatory plans:

          o  allowing the Companies' electric customers to select their
             generation suppliers;

          o  establishing PLR obligations to customers in the Companies' service
             areas;

          o  allowing recovery of transition costs (sometimes referred to as
             stranded investment);

          o  itemizing (unbundling) the price of electricity into its component
             elements  -  including generation, transmission, distribution and
             transition costs recovery charges;

          o  deregulating the Companies' electric generation businesses;




          o  continuing regulation of the Companies' transmission and
             distribution systems; and

          o  requiring corporate separation of regulated and unregulated
             business activities.

       PUCO Rate Matters

          In July 1999, Ohio's electric utility restructuring legislation, which
allowed Ohio electric customers to select their generation  suppliers  beginning
January 1, 2001,  was signed  into law.  Among  other  things,  the  legislation
provided for a 5% reduction on the generation portion of residential  customers'
bills and the  opportunity to recover  transition  costs,  including  regulatory
assets,  from  January 1, 2001 through  December  31, 2005  (market  development
period).  The period for the recovery of regulatory  assets only can be extended
up to December  31, 2010.  The PUCO was  authorized  to  determine  the level of
transition  cost  recovery,  as well as the recovery  period for the  regulatory
assets  portion of those costs,  in  considering  each Ohio  electric  utility's
transition plan application.

          In July 2000, the PUCO approved FirstEnergy's  transition plan for OE,
CEI and TE (Ohio  Companies)  as modified by a settlement  agreement  with major
parties to the transition plan. The application of SFAS 71,  "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain  Types of  Regulation"  to OE's  generation  business and the
nonnuclear  generation  businesses  of  CEI  and TE was  discontinued  with  the
issuance of the PUCO transition plan order,  as described  further below.  Major
provisions  of the  settlement  agreement  consisted  of approval of recovery of
generation-related  transition  costs as filed of $4.0  billion  net of deferred
income  taxes  (OE-$1.6  billion,  CEI-$1.6  billion  and TE-$0.8  billion)  and
transition  costs related to  regulatory  assets as filed of $2.9 billion net of
deferred income taxes (OE-$1.0  billion,  CEI-$1.4 billion and TE-$0.5 billion),
with  recovery  through no later than 2006 for OE,  mid-2007 for TE and 2008 for
CEI,  except where a longer period of recovery is provided for in the settlement
agreement. The generation-related  transition costs include $1.4 billion, net of
deferred income taxes,  (OE-$1.0 billion,  CEI-$0.2 billion and TE-$0.2 billion)
of impaired  generating  assets  recognized  as  regulatory  assets as described
further below,  $2.4 billion,  net of deferred income taxes,  (OE-$1.2  billion,
CEI-$0.4  billion and TE-$0.8 billion) of above market operating lease costs and
$0.8  billion,  net of  deferred  income  taxes,  (CEI-$0.5  billion and TE-$0.3
billion)  of  additional  plant  costs  that  were  reflected  on CEI's and TE's
regulatory financial statements.

          Also as part of the  settlement  agreement,  the Ohio  Companies  give
preferred access over its subsidiaries to nonaffiliated  marketers,  brokers and
aggregators  to 1,120  megawatts  (MW) of  generation  capacity  through 2005 at
established  prices for sales to the Ohio Companies' retail customers.  Customer
prices are frozen through the five-year market  development  period,  which runs
through  the end of 2005,  except  for  certain  limited  statutory  exceptions,
including  the 5%  reduction  referred  to above.  In  February  2003,  the Ohio
Companies were authorized increases in annual revenues aggregating approximately
$50 million (OE-$41 million,  CEI-$4 million and TE-$5 million) to recover their
higher tax costs resulting from the Ohio deregulation legislation.

          The Ohio Companies' customers choosing  alternative  suppliers receive
an additional incentive applied to the shopping credit (generation component) of
45%  for  residential  customers,  30%  for  commercial  customers  and  15% for
industrial  customers.  The  amount of the  incentive  is  deferred  for  future
recovery  from  customers.  Subject to  approval by the PUCO,  recovery  will be
accomplished by extending the respective transition cost recovery period.

          On October 21, 2003, the Ohio Companies filed an application  with the
PUCO to  establish  generation  service  rates  beginning  January 1,  2006,  in
response to  expressed  concerns by the PUCO about price and supply  uncertainty
following  the end of the market  development  period.  The filing  included two
options:

          o   A competitive auction, which would establish a price for
              generation that customers would be charged during the period
              covered by the auction, or

          o   A Rate Stabilization Plan, which would extend current generation
              prices through 2008, ensuring adequate supply and continuing our
              support of energy efficiency and economic development efforts.

          Under  the first  option,  an  auction  would be  conducted  to secure
generation  service  for the  Ohio  Companies'  customers.  Beginning  in  2006,
customers would pay market prices for generation as determined by the auction.

          Under the Rate Stabilization  Plan option,  customers would have price
and supply  stability  through  2008 - three years  beyond the end of the market
development period - as well as the benefits of a competitive  market.  Customer
benefits would include:  customer  savings by extending the current five percent
discount on generation  costs and other customer  credits;  maintaining  current
distribution  base  rates  through  2007;  market-based  auctions  that  may  be
conducted  annually to ensure that  customers pay the lowest  available  prices;
extension of the Ohio Companies' support of  energy-efficiency  programs and the
potential for continuing the program to give preferred  access to  nonaffiliated
entities to generation  capacity if shopping drops below 20%. Under the proposed
plan, FirstEnergy is requesting:

          o   Extension of the transition cost amortization period for OE from
              2006 to 2007; for CEI from 2008 to mid-2009 and for TE from
              mid-2007 to mid-2008;





          o   Deferral of interest costs on the accumulated shopping
              incentives and other cost deferrals as new regulatory assets;
              and

          o   Ability to initiate a request to increase generation rates under
              certain limited conditions.

          On January 7, 2004,  the PUCO staff filed  testimony  on the  proposed
rate plan  generally  supporting the Rate  Stabilization  Plan as opposed to the
competitive  auction  proposal.  Hearings  began on  February  11, 2004 and were
completed on March 1, 2004.  On February 23 2004,  after  consideration  of PUCO
Staff  comments  and  testimony  as  well  as  those  provided  by  some  of the
intervening  parties,   FirstEnergy  made  certain  modifications  to  the  Rate
Stabilization Plan. A decision is expected from the PUCO in the Spring of 2004.

       NJBPU Rate Matters

          JCP&L's 2001 Final  Decision  and Order (Final  Order) with respect to
its rate  unbundling,  stranded cost and  restructuring  filings  confirmed rate
reductions  set  forth in its 1999  Summary  Order,  which had been in effect at
increasing  levels  through  July  2003.  The Final  Order  also  confirmed  the
establishment  of a  non-bypassable  societal  benefits  charge (SBC) to recover
costs which include nuclear plant  decommissioning  and  manufactured  gas plant
remediation,  as  well  as  a  non-bypassable  market  transition  charge  (MTC)
primarily  to recover  stranded  costs.  The NJBPU has  deferred  making a final
determination of the net proceeds and stranded costs related to prior generating
asset  divestitures  until JCP&L's request for an Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
ruling  regarding  the treatment of  associated  federal  income tax benefits is
acted  upon.  Should the IRS ruling  support  the return of the tax  benefits to
customers, there would be no effect on FirstEnergy's or JCP&L's net income since
the contingency existed prior to the merger.

          In addition,  the Final Order  provided for the ability to  securitize
stranded  costs  associated  with the divested  Oyster Creek Nuclear  Generating
Station.  Under NJBPU  authorization  in 2002,  JCP&L issued  through its wholly
owned subsidiary, JCP&L Transition Funding LLC, $320 million of transition bonds
(recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) which securitized the recovery of
these costs and which provided for a usage-based  non-bypassable transition bond
charge (TBC) and for the transfer of the bondable transition property to another
entity.

          Prior to August 1, 2003,  JCP&L's  PLR  obligation  to  provide  basic
generation service (BGS) to non-shopping  customers was supplied almost entirely
from  contracted  and open market  purchases.  JCP&L is  permitted  to defer for
future collection from customers the amounts by which its costs of supplying BGS
to non-shopping  customers and costs incurred under nonutility  generation (NUG)
agreements  exceed amounts  collected  through BGS and MTC rates. As of December
31, 2003,  the  accumulated  deferred cost balance  totaled  approximately  $440
million, after the charge discussed below. The NJBPU also allowed securitization
of JCP&L's  deferred  balance to the extent permitted by law upon application by
JCP&L and a  determination  by the NJBPU that the  conditions  of the New Jersey
restructuring  legislation  are met. There can be no assurance as to the extent,
if any, that the NJBPU will permit such securitization.

          Under New Jersey  transition  legislation,  all electric  distribution
companies  were  required to file rate cases to determine the level of unbundled
rate components to become effective August 1, 2003. JCP&L's two August 2002 rate
filings requested  increases in base electric rates of approximately $98 million
annually and  requested  the recovery of deferred  costs that  exceeded  amounts
being  recovered  under the current MTC and SBC rates;  one  proposed  method of
recovery of these costs is the  securitization  of the  deferred  balance.  This
securitization  methodology  is  similar  to  the  Oyster  Creek  securitization
discussed  above.  On July 25, 2003, the NJBPU announced its JCP&L base electric
rate proceeding decision, which reduced JCP&L's annual revenues by approximately
$62 million  effective  August 1, 2003.  The NJBPU decision also provided for an
interim return on equity of 9.5 percent on JCP&L's rate base for 6 to 12 months.
During that period,  JCP&L will initiate another  proceeding to request recovery
of additional costs incurred to enhance system reliability.  In that proceeding,
the NJBPU could  increase the return on equity to 9.75 percent or decrease it to
9.25 percent, depending on its assessment of the reliability of JCP&L's service.
Any reduction  would be retroactive to August 1, 2003. The net revenue  decrease
from the NJBPU's decision consists of a $223 million decrease in the electricity
delivery charge, a $111 million increase due to the August 1, 2003 expiration of
annual  customer  credits  previously  mandated  by the  New  Jersey  transition
legislation,  a $49 million increase in the MTC tariff  component,  and a net $1
million  increase  in the SBC  charge.  The MTC allows for the  recovery of $465
million in deferred  energy  costs over the next ten years on an interim  basis,
thus  disallowing $153 million of the $618 million provided for in a preliminary
settlement  agreement  between  certain  parties.  As a result,  JCP&L  recorded
charges to net income for the year ended  December  31, 2003,  aggregating  $185
million ($109  million net of tax)  consisting of the $153 million of disallowed
deferred  energy  costs and other  regulatory  assets.  JCP&L filed a motion for
rehearing and reconsideration  with the NJBPU on August 15, 2003 with respect to
the following  issues:  (1) the disallowance of the $153 million deferred energy
costs;  (2) the  reduced  rate of return on  equity;  and (3) $42.7  million  of
disallowed costs to achieve merger savings.  On October 10, 2003, the NJBPU held
the  motion in  abeyance  until  the final  NJBPU  decision  and order  which is
expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2004.




          JCP&L's BGS obligation for the twelve month period beginning August 1,
2003 was  auctioned  in February  2003.  The  auction  covered a fixed price bid
(applicable to all residential and smaller commercial and industrial  customers)
and an hourly price bid (applicable to all large industrial  customers) process.
JCP&L  sells  all  self-supplied  energy  (NUGs  and  owned  generation)  to the
wholesale market with offsetting  credits to its deferred energy  balances.  The
BGS auction for the subsequent  period was completed in February 2004. The NJBPU
adjusted the  generation  component of JCP&L's retail rates on August 1, 2003 to
reflect the results of the BGS auction.

          On July  5,  2003,  JCP&L  experienced  a  series  of  34.5  kilo-volt
sub-transmission  line faults that  resulted in outages on the New Jersey shore.
The NJBPU  instituted an investigation  into these outages,  and directed that a
Special Reliability Master be hired to oversee the investigation. On December 8,
2003, the Special Reliability Master issued his Interim Report recommending that
JCP&L implement a series of actions to improve  reliability in the area affected
by the  outages.  The NJBPU  adopted the  findings  and  recommendations  of the
Interim  Report on  December  17,  2003,  and  ordered  JCP&L to  implement  the
recommended  actions on a staggered basis,  with initial actions to be completed
by March 31,  2004.  JCP&L  expects to spend $12.5  million  implementing  these
actions during 2004.

       PPUC Rate Matters

          The PPUC authorized 1998 rate restructuring plans for Penn, Met-Ed and
Penelec.  In 2000,  the PPUC  disallowed a portion of the  requested  additional
stranded  costs above those amounts  granted in Met-Ed's and Penelec's 1998 rate
restructuring  plan orders.  The PPUC required Met-Ed and Penelec to seek an IRS
ruling  regarding the return of certain  unamortized  investment tax credits and
excess deferred income tax benefits to customers.  Similar to JCP&L's situation,
if the IRS ruling ultimately supports returning these tax benefits to customers,
there  would be no effect to  FirstEnergy's,  Met-Ed's or  Penelec's  net income
since the contingency existed prior to the merger.

          In June 2001, the PPUC approved the Settlement Stipulation with all of
the major parties in the combined merger and rate proceedings which approved the
merger  and  provided  PLR  deferred  accounting  treatment  for  energy  costs,
permitting  Met-Ed and Penelec to defer,  for future  recovery,  energy costs in
excess of amounts  reflected in their capped  generation  rates  retroactive  to
January 1, 2001.  This PLR deferral  accounting  procedure was later denied in a
February 2002 Commonwealth  Court of Pennsylvania  decision.  The court decision
also affirmed the PPUC decision regarding the merger,  remanding the decision to
the  PPUC  only  with  respect  to the  issue  of  merger  savings.  FirstEnergy
established  reserves in 2002 for Met-Ed's  and  Penelec's  PLR deferred  energy
costs which aggregated  $287.1 million,  reflecting the potential adverse impact
of the then pending  Pennsylvania  Supreme Court decision  whether to review the
Commonwealth Court decision.

          On April 2,  2003,  the PPUC  remanded  the issue  relating  to merger
savings to the Office of  Administrative  Law for hearings,  directed Met-Ed and
Penelec to file a position paper on the effect of the  Commonwealth  Court order
on the Settlement Stipulation and allowed other parties to file responses to the
position paper.  Met-Ed and Penelec filed a letter with the  Administrative  Law
Judge  (ALJ) on June 11,  2003,  voiding the  Stipulation  in its  entirety  and
reinstating Met-Ed's and Penelec's restructuring  settlement previously approved
by the PPUC.

          On October  2,  2003,  the PPUC  issued an order  concluding  that the
Commonwealth Court reversed the PPUC's June 20, 2001 order in its entirety.  The
PPUC directed Met-Ed and Penelec to file tariffs within thirty days of the order
to reflect the competitive  transition  charge (CTC) rates and shopping  credits
that were in effect  prior to the June 21, 2001 order to be  effective  upon one
day's  notice.  In  response  to that  order,  Met-Ed and  Penelec  filed  these
supplements to their tariffs to become effective October 24, 2003.

          On  October  8,  2003,   Met-Ed  and  Penelec  filed  a  petition  for
clarification  relating to the October 2, 2003 order on two issues: to establish
June 30, 2004 as the date to fully refund the NUG trust fund and to clarify that
the ordered  accounting  treatment  regarding the CTC rate/shopping  credit swap
should  follow the  ratemaking,  and that the PPUC's  findings  would not impair
their rights to recover all of their stranded costs. On October 9, 2003,  ARIPPA
(an  intervenor  in the  proceedings)  petitioned  the PPUC to direct Met-Ed and
Penelec  to  reinstate   accounting  for  the  CTC  rate/shopping   credit  swap
retroactive to January 1, 2002.  Several other parties also filed petitions.  On
October 16,  2003,  the PPUC issued a  reconsideration  order  granting the date
requested by Met-Ed and Penelec for the NUG trust fund refund,  denying Met-Ed's
and Penelec's other  clarification  requests and granting ARIPPA's petition with
respect to the  accounting  treatment  of the  changes to the CTC  rate/shopping
credit swap. On October 22, 2003, Met-Ed and Penelec filed an Objection with the
Commonwealth  Court  asking  that the Court  reverse  the  PPUC's  finding  that
requires  Met-Ed  and  Penelec  to treat the  stipulated  CTC rates that were in
effect  from  January 1, 2002 on a  retroactive  basis.  Met-Ed and  Penelec are
considering  filing an appeal to the  Commonwealth  Court on the PPUC  orders as
well.

          On October  27,  2003,  a  Commonwealth  Court  judge  issued an Order
denying  Met-Ed's  and  Penelec's  objection  without  explanation.  Due  to the
vagueness  of the Order,  Met-Ed and  Penelec,  on October  31,  2003,  filed an
Application  for  Clarification  with the judge.  Concurrent  with this  filing,
Met-Ed and  Penelec,  in order to  preserve  their  rights,  also filed with the
Commonwealth  Court  both a Petition  for  Review of the  PPUC's  October 16 and
October 22 Orders,  and an  application  for  reargument,  if the judge,  in his
clarification  order,  indicates  that  Met-Ed's  and  Penelec's  objection  was
intended to be denied on the merits.  In addition to these findings,  Met-Ed and
Penelec,  in compliance  with the PPUC's  Orders,  filed revised PPUC  quarterly




reports for the twelve  months  ended  December  31, 2001 and 2002,  and for the
first two  quarters  of 2003,  reflecting  balances  consistent  with the PPUC's
findings in their Orders.

          Effective  September 1, 2002,  Met-Ed and Penelec  assigned  their PLR
responsibility  to their FES affiliate through a wholesale power sale agreement.
The PLR sale will be  automatically  extended for each successive  calendar year
unless any party elects to cancel the  agreement by November 1 of the  preceding
year.  Under  the terms of the  wholesale  agreement,  FES  assumed  the  supply
obligation  and the supply profit and loss risk, for the portion of power supply
requirements  not  self-supplied by Met-Ed and Penelec under their NUG contracts
and other  power  contracts  with  nonaffiliated  third  party  suppliers.  This
arrangement  reduces  Met-Ed's and Penelec's  exposure to high  wholesale  power
prices by  providing  power at a fixed  price for their  uncommitted  PLR energy
costs during the term of the agreement with FES. FES has hedged most of Met-Ed's
and  Penelec's  unfilled  PLR on-peak  obligation  through 2004 and a portion of
2005, the period during which deferred  accounting was previously  allowed under
the PPUC's  order.  Met-Ed and Penelec  are  authorized  to  continue  deferring
differences between NUG contract costs and current market prices.

          In late 2003,  the PPUC  issued a  Tentative  Order  implementing  new
reliability  benchmarks  and  standards.  In  connection  therewith,   the  PPUC
commenced a  rulemaking  procedure  to amend the  Electric  Service  Reliability
Regulations to implement these new benchmarks,  and create additional  reporting
on  reliability.  Although  neither  the  Tentative  Order  nor the  Reliability
Rulemaking has been finalized,  the PPUC ordered all  Pennsylvania  utilities to
begin filing quarterly  reports on November 1, 2003. The comment period for both
the  Tentative  Order and the  Proposed  Rulemaking  Order has  closed.  Met-Ed,
Penelec and Penn are currently  awaiting the PPUC to issue a final order in both
matters.  The order  will  determine  (1) the  standards  and  benchmarks  to be
utilized,  and (2) the details required in the quarterly and annual reports.  It
is expected that these Orders will be finalized in March of 2004.

          On January 16,  2004,  the PPUC  initiated a formal  investigation  of
Met-Ed's, Penelec's and Penn's levels of compliance with the Public Utility Code
and the PPUC's  regulations and orders with regard to reliable electric service.
Hearings  will be held in  August  in this  investigation,  and the ALJ has been
directed to issue a  Recommended  Decision by September  30,  2004,  in order to
allow the PPUC time to issue a Final Order before December 16, 2004. FirstEnergy
is unable to predict the outcome of the  investigation or the impact of the PPUC
order.

       FERC Rate Matters

          The Companies provide wholesale power and transmission service subject
to the jurisdiction of the FERC.

          Following the FirstEnergy/GPU  merger, the transmission  facilities of
JCP&L,  Met-Ed and Penelec  continue to be operated by PJM.  PJM was approved by
the FERC as a regional  transmission  organization  (RTO) on December  20, 2002.
Transmission   service  over  the  facilities  of  FirstEnergy's  PJM  operating
companies is provided under the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff.

          ATSI transferred operational control of its transmission facilities in
the East Central Area Reliability  Agreement (ECAR) area to the MISO RTO as part
of  GridAmerica,  LLC, an  independent  transmission  company.  This transfer of
control  became  effective  on October 1, 2003.  Transmission  service  over the
facilities  of ATSI is now  provided  under  the MISO Open  Access  Transmission
Tariff. A settlement of all rate matters related to ATSI's integration into MISO
was filed with FERC on December 18, 2003 and is waiting decision by FERC.

          PJM and MISO  were  ordered  by the FERC to  develop  a common  market
between the regions by October 31, 2004.  The FERC also  initiated a Section 206
investigation  into the  reasonableness  of the  "through-and-out"  transmission
rates  charged by PJM and MISO.  On November  17, 2003,  the FERC issued  orders
directing MISO, PJM, and certain unaffiliated transmission owners in the Midwest
to eliminate their transmission rates for point-to-point service effective April
1, 2004. A settlement judge has been appointed by the FERC to resolve compliance
filings  by the  affected  transmission  providers.  As part  of the  settlement
process,  the FERC extended the date for  elimination of  through-and-out  rates
until May 1, 2004.  AEP,  Commonwealth  Edison,  and other  transmission  owning
utilities have appealed the FERC's November 17, 2003 orders to the federal court
of appeals for the District of Columbia.

       Regulatory Accounting

          All of the Companies'  regulatory assets (deferred costs) are expected
to continue to be recovered under provisions of the Ohio transition plan and the
respective  Pennsylvania  and New Jersey  regulatory  plans.  The application of
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation",  has been  discontinued with respect to
the Companies' generation operations.

           The Companies' and FES's respective investments for additional
nuclear fuel, and nuclear fuel investment reductions as the fuel is consumed,
during the 2004-2006 period are presented in the following table. The table also
displays the Companies' operating lease commitments, net of capital trust cash
receipts for the 2004-2006 period.



          Short-term  borrowings  outstanding as of December 31, 2003, consisted
of $372 million of bank borrowings (FirstEnergy-$280 million, OE-$22 million and
TE-$70 million), and $150 million of OES Capital, Incorporated commercial paper.
OES Capital is a wholly owned  subsidiary of OE whose  borrowings are secured by
customer accounts receivable.  OES Capital can borrow up to $170 million under a
receivables financing agreement at rates based on certain bank commercial paper.
FirstEnergy had $516 million available under $1.25 billion of revolving lines of
credit as of December  31, 2003.  FirstEnergy  may borrow under its facility and
could  transfer  any of its  borrowings  to  affiliated  companies.  OE had $477
million of unused bank facilities as of December 31, 2003. An additional  source
of ongoing cash for FirstEnergy,  as a holding  company,  is cash dividends from
its  subsidiaries.  In 2003, the holding  company  received $864 million of cash
dividends on common stock from its subsidiaries.




           Based on their present plans, the Companies could provide for their
cash requirements in 2004 from the following sources: funds to be received from
operations; available cash and temporary cash investments as of December 31,
2003 (Company's nonutility subsidiaries-$85 million, OE-$2 million, CEI-$25
million, TE-$2 million); the issuance of long-term debt (for refunding
purposes); and funds available under revolving credit arrangements. Cash and
cash equivalents as of December 31, 2003 included $32 million received in
December 2003 which was included in the NRG settlement claim sold in January
2004.
          The extent and type of future  financings  will depend on the need for
external funds as well as market  conditions,  the maintenance of an appropriate
capital  structure  and the ability of the  Companies  to comply  with  coverage
requirements  in order to issue first  mortgage bonds and preferred  stock.  The
Companies  will  continue to monitor  financial  market  conditions  and,  where
appropriate,  may take  advantage of economic  opportunities  to refund debt and
preferred stock to the extent that their financial resources permit.

          The coverage  requirements  contained in the first mortgage indentures
under which the Companies  issue first mortgage  bonds provide that,  except for
certain  refunding  purposes,  the Companies may not issue first  mortgage bonds
unless applicable net earnings (before income taxes),  calculated as provided in
the indentures,  for any period of twelve  consecutive months within the fifteen
calendar months  preceding the month in which such additional  bonds are issued,
are at least twice annual interest  requirements  on outstanding  first mortgage
bonds,  including those being issued.  Under OE's first mortgage indenture,  the
availability of property additions is more restrictive than the earnings test at
the present  time and would limit the amount of first  mortgage  bonds  issuable
against  property  additions  to $238  million.  OE is  currently  able to issue
approximately  $1.4 billion  principal  amount of first  mortgage  bonds against
previously retired bonds without the need to meet the above restrictions.  Under
Penn's first  mortgage  indenture,  other  requirements  also apply and are more
restrictive  than the earnings test at the present time.  Penn is currently able
to issue $451 million  principal amount of first mortgage bonds, with up to $237
million of such amount issuable against property additions;  the remainder could
be issued against  previously  retired bonds. CEI can issue  approximately  $1.1
billion  principal  amount of first  mortgage  bonds  against a  combination  of
previously retired bonds and property additions. TE cannot currently issue first
mortgage bonds. JCP&L,  Met-Ed and Penelec are able to issue $126 million,  $189
million and $23 million principal amount, respectively, of first mortgage bonds.

          OE's, Penn's,  TE's and JCP&L's  respective  articles of incorporation
prohibit the sale of preferred stock unless applicable gross income,  calculated
as provided in the articles of  incorporation,  is equal to at least 1-1/2 times
the aggregate of the annual interest  requirements  on  indebtedness  and annual
dividend  requirements on preferred stock  outstanding  immediately  thereafter.
Based upon earnings for 2003 an assumed dividend rate of 7.38% (OE and Penn) and
7.25%  (JCP&L),  and no  additional  indebtedness,  OE,  Penn and JCP&L would be
permitted,  under the  earnings  coverage  test  contained  in their  respective
charters,  to issue at least $2.4  billion,  $244  million  and $189  million of
preferred stock, respectively;  TE cannot currently issue preferred stock. There
are no restrictions on the ability of CEI, Met-Ed and Penelec to issue preferred
stock.

          To the extent that coverage requirements or market conditions restrict
the  Companies'  abilities to issue desired  amounts of first  mortgage bonds or
preferred  stock,  the  Companies  may seek  other  methods of  financing.  Such
financings  could include the sale of preferred  and/or  preference  stock or of
such other types of securities  as might be authorized by applicable  regulatory
authorities  which  would  not  otherwise  be sold and  could  result  in annual
interest  charges  and/or  dividend  requirements  in excess of those that would
otherwise be incurred.

       Met-Ed Capital Trust and Penelec Capital Trust

          In 1999,  Met-Ed Capital  Trust, a wholly owned  subsidiary of Met-Ed,
issued  $100  million of trust  preferred  securities  (Met-Ed  Trust  Preferred
Securities) at 7.35%,  due 2039. The sole assets of Met-Ed Capital Trust are the
7.35%  Cumulative  Preferred  Securities  of Met-Ed  Capital  II,  L.P.  (Met-Ed
Partnership  Preferred  Securities) and its only revenues are the quarterly cash
distributions it receives on the Met-Ed Partnership Preferred  Securities.  Each
Met-Ed  Trust  Preferred  Security  represents  a Met-Ed  Partnership  Preferred
Security. Met-Ed Capital II, L.P. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Met-Ed and the
sponsor of Met-Ed Capital Trust.  The sole assets of Met-Ed Capital II, L.P. are
Met-Ed's  7.35%  Subordinated  Debentures,  Series  A, due 2039,  which  have an
aggregate  principal  amount of $103.1 million.  Distributions  were made on the
Trust Preferred  Securities  during 2003 in the aggregate  amount of $7,350,000.
Expenses of Met-Ed Trust for 2003 were  approximately  $5,000, all of which were
paid by Met-Ed Preferred Capital II, Inc., the general partner of Met-Ed Capital
II, L.P. The Trust  Preferred  Securities are issued in book-entry  form only so
that there is only one holder of  record.  Met-Ed has fully and  unconditionally
guaranteed the Met-Ed Partnership  Preferred  Securities,  and,  therefore,  the
Met-Ed Trust Preferred Securities.

          In 1999,  Penelec Capital Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of Penelec,
issued $100  million of trust  preferred  securities  (Penelec  Trust  Preferred
Securities) at 7.34%, due 2039. The sole assets of Penelec Capital Trust are the




7.34%  Cumulative  Preferred  Securities  of Penelec  Capital II, L.P.  (Penelec
Partnership  Preferred  Securities) and its only revenues are the quarterly cash
distributions it receives on the Penelec Partnership Preferred Securities.  Each
Penelec Trust  Preferred  Security  represents a Penelec  Partnership  Preferred
Security.  Penelec Capital II, L.P. is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Penelec and
the sponsor of Penelec  Capital  Trust.  The sole assets of Penelec  Capital II,
L.P. are Penelec's 7.34% Subordinated Debentures, Series A, due 2039, which have
an aggregate principal amount of $103.1 million.  Distributions were made on the
Trust Preferred  Securities  during 2003 in the aggregate  amount of $7,340,000.
Expenses of Penelec Trust for 2003 were approximately  $5,000, all of which were
paid by Penelec  Preferred  Capital II,  Inc.,  the  general  partner of Penelec
Capital II, L.P. The Trust  Preferred  Securities are issued in book-entry  form
only so that  there  is only  one  holder  of  record.  Penelec  has  fully  and
unconditionally  guaranteed the Penelec Partnership Preferred  Securities,  and,
therefore, the Penelec Trust Preferred Securities.

          Upon  adoption  of  FIN  46R,   "Consolidation  of  Variable  Interest
Entities",  the limited  partnerships  and statutory  business trusts  discussed
above are not  consolidated  on the financial  statements of  FirstEnergy,  CEI,
Met-Ed and Penelec as of December 31, 2003.

Nuclear Regulation

          The construction,  operation and decommissioning of nuclear generating
units are  subject to the  regulatory  jurisdiction  of the  Nuclear  Regulatory
Commission (NRC) including the issuance by it of construction permits, operating
licenses,  and possession only licenses for decommissioning  reactors. The NRC's
procedures with respect to the amendment of nuclear reactor  operating  licenses
afford opportunities for interested parties to request adjudicatory  hearings on
health,  safety and  environmental  issues  subject to  meeting  NRC  "standing"
requirements.  The NRC may  require  substantial  changes  in  operation  or the
installation of additional equipment to meet safety or environmental  standards,
subject to the backfit rule  requiring the NRC to justify such new  requirements
as  necessary  for the  overall  protection  of public  health and  safety.  The
possibility also exists for modification, denial or revocation of licenses. As a
result of the merger with GPU, FirstEnergy now owns the Three Mile Island Unit 2
(TMI-2) and the Saxton Nuclear  Experimental  Facility.  Both  facilities are in
various  stages  of  decommissioning.  TMI-2  is in a  post-defueling  monitored
storage condition,  with decommissioning planned in 2014. Saxton is in the final
stages of  decommissioning,  with license  termination  scheduled for the fourth
quarter of 2004 and its final site restoration is scheduled for the end of 2004.
Beaver  Valley  Unit 1 was  placed  in  commercial  operation  in 1976,  and its
operating  license  expires  in  2016.  Davis-Besse  was  placed  in  commercial
operation in 1977, and its operating  license expires in 2017.  Perry Unit 1 and
Beaver  Valley Unit 2 were placed in  commercial  operation  in 1987,  and their
operating licenses expire in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

          Davis-Besse, which is operated by FENOC, began its scheduled refueling
outage on February 16,  2002.  The plant was  originally  scheduled to return to
service  by the end of March  2002.  During  the  refueling  outage,  visual and
ultrasonic  testings were conducted on all 69 of the Control Rod Drive Mechanism
penetration  nozzles.  This  testing  was  performed  to  check  for the kind of
circular or  circumferential  cracking in these  nozzles  that had been found at
some other  plants  similar in design and vintage to  Davis-Besse.  Based on the
inspection  and test results,  five nozzles were scheduled for repair during the
refueling outage.

          As repair work began on one of the nozzles,  FENOC found  corrosion in
the reactor  vessel head near some of the  penetration  holes,  created by boric
acid  deposits  from  leaks  in the  nozzles.  As a  result,  the NRC  issued  a
confirmatory action letter stating that restart of the plant would be subject to
prior NRC  approval,  and it  established  an  Inspection  Manual  Chapter  0350
Oversight  Panel to  ensure  close NRC  oversight  of  Davis-Besse's  corrective
actions.

          In response to the reactor vessel head degradation,  FENOC initiated a
number of root cause analyses and other assessments, and established a Return to
Service  Plan to correct  the causes  and ensure a safe and  reliable  return to
service.  The Return to Service Plan  included  actions to:  replace the reactor
vessel head,  inspect and correct other  components in the containment  that may
have been  affected  by boric acid,  review  important  systems and  programs to
ensure  their   readiness  for  restart,   and  improve   management  and  human
performance.  FENOC has completed all of the actions under the Return to Service
Plan and is currently implementing corrective actions and performing assessments
for operations issues identified in the late 2003 and early 2004.

          On  March  8,  2004,  FENOC  received  NRC  authorization  to  restart
Davis-Besse.  FENOC formally requested startup authorization at the February 12,
2004, NRC 0350 panel meeting in Port Clinton,  Ohio. The plant will be restarted
in a deliberate  and controlled  manner,  with reactor  operators  incrementally
increasing  reactor  power,  stopping at the 50-percent  and  100-percent  power
levels to test equipment and assess operational performance.  Also, post-restart
assessments  will be conducted  two weeks and one month after the plant  reaches
100-percent power. Operators expect to reach full power by mid-March.

          The NRC granted restart  authorization in an order containing  several
commitments for  Davis-Besse.  Those  requirements  include ongoing  independent
assessments  of the site's  operational  performance,  safety culture and safety
conscious work environment,  and corrective action and engineering  programs for




five years,  as well as visual  inspection  of the reactor head and lower vessel
during the plant's mid-cycle outage, slated in about one year.

          In  2002,  FENOC  spent   approximately  $115  million  in  additional
nuclear-related  operation and maintenance costs,  approximately $120 million in
replacement power costs and  approximately  $63 million in capital  expenditures
related to the reactor head and restart.  In 2003, FENOC spent approximately $93
million  in  additional   nuclear-related   operation  and  maintenance   costs,
approximately  $196 million in  replacement  power costs and  approximately  $21
million in capital  expenditures  related to the reactor head and  restart.  For
2004,   FENOC  expects  to  spend   approximately   $10  million  in  additional
nuclear-related operation and maintenance costs and approximately $15-20 million
in replacement power costs per month during the remaining period of the outage.

          FENOC  recently  received a subpoena  from a grand jury sitting in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division
requesting  the  production  of certain  documents  and records  relating to the
inspection and maintenance of the reactor vessel head at the Davis-Besse  plant.
We are unable to predict the outcome of this investigation.  In addition,  FENOC
remains  subject to possible civil  enforcement  action by the NRC in connection
with the  events  leading  to the  Davis  Besse  outage.  If it were  ultimately
determined that  FirstEnergy has legal liability or is otherwise made subject to
regulatory or civil enforcement  action with respect to the Davis-Besse  outage,
it could have a material adverse effect on FirstEnergy's financial condition and
results of operations.

          The NRC  has  promulgated  and  continues  to  promulgate  orders  and
regulations  related to the safe operation of nuclear power plants and standards
for decommissioning clean-up and final license termination. The Companies cannot
predict what additional  orders and regulations  (including  post-September  11,
2001 security  enhancements) may be promulgated,  design changes required or the
effect  that any such  regulations  or design  changes  or  additional  clean-up
standards for final site release,  or the consideration  thereof,  may have upon
their nuclear  plants.  Although the  Companies  have no reason to anticipate an
accident at any of their  nuclear  plants,  if such an accident  did happen,  it
could  have  a  material  but  currently   undeterminable   adverse   effect  on
FirstEnergy's  consolidated financial position. In addition, such an accident at
any operating nuclear plant, whether or not owned by the Companies, could result
in regulations or requirements  that could affect the operation,  licensing,  or
decommissioning  of  plants  that the  Companies  do own with a  consequent  but
currently  undeterminable  adverse  impact,  and  could  affect  the  Companies'
abilities to raise funds in the capital markets.

Nuclear Insurance

          The  Price-Anderson  Act  limits  the  public  liability  which can be
assessed with respect to a nuclear  power plant to $10.9  billion  (assuming 105
units  licensed to  operate)  for a single  nuclear  incident,  which  amount is
covered by: (i) private  insurance  amounting  to $300  million;  and (ii) $10.6
billion  provided by an industry  retrospective  rating plan required by the NRC
pursuant  thereto.  Under  such  retrospective  rating  plan,  in the event of a
nuclear  incident at any unit in the United States resulting in losses in excess
of private  insurance,  up to $100.6  million (but not more than $10 million per
unit per year in the event of more than one incident)  must be  contributed  for
each nuclear unit licensed to operate in the country by the licensees thereof to
cover  liabilities  arising out of the incident.  Based on their present nuclear
ownership and leasehold  interests,  the Companies' maximum potential assessment
under these provisions would be $402.4 million  (OE-$107.5  million,  Penn-$84.5
million, CEI-$121.4 million and TE-$89.0 million) per incident but not more than
$40.0  million  (OE-$10.7  million,  Penn-$8.4  million,  CEI-$12.1  million and
TE-$8.8 million) in any one year for each incident.

          In addition to the public liability insurance provided pursuant to the
Price-Anderson  Act, the  Companies  have also  obtained  insurance  coverage in
limited  amounts for economic  loss and property  damage  arising out of nuclear
incidents.  The Companies are members of NEIL which  provides  coverage (NEIL I)
for the extra expense of replacement power incurred due to prolonged  accidental
outages of nuclear units.  Under NEIL I, the Companies have policies,  renewable
yearly,  corresponding to their respective nuclear  interests,  which provide an
aggregate  indemnity of up to  approximately  $1.182 billion  (OE-$315  million,
Penn-$222  million,  CEI-$382 million and TE-$263 million) for replacement power
costs incurred during an outage after an initial 12-week waiting period. Members
of NEIL I pay annual  premiums and are subject to  assessments  if losses exceed
the accumulated funds available to the insurer.  The Companies'  present maximum
aggregate  assessment for incidents at any covered  nuclear  facility  occurring
during a policy  year would be  approximately  $8.6  million  (OE-$2.3  million,
Penn-$1.6 million, CEI-$2.8 million and TE-$1.9 million).

          The Companies  are insured as to their  respective  nuclear  interests
under property damage  insurance  provided by NEIL to the operating  company for
each  plant.   Under  these   arrangements,   $2.75   billion  of  coverage  for
decontamination  costs,  decommissioning costs, debris removal and repair and/or
replacement of property is provided.  The Companies pay annual premiums for this
coverage and are liable for  retrospective  assessments  of up to  approximately
$55.5 million (OE-$14.9 million, Penn-$10.2 million, CEI-$17.7 million, TE-$12.0
million,  JCP&L-$0.2  million,  Met-Ed-$0.3  million and  Penelec-$0.2  million)
during a policy year.

          The Companies  intend to maintain  insurance  against nuclear risks as
described  above as long as it is  available.  To the  extent  that  replacement
power, property damage, decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement
costs  and other  such  costs  arising  from a  nuclear  incident  at any of the




Companies'  plants  exceed the policy  limits of the  insurance  in effect  with
respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear  incident is determined not to be
covered by the Companies'  insurance  policies,  or to the extent such insurance
becomes  unavailable in the future,  the Companies would remain at risk for such
costs.

          The NRC  requires  nuclear  power plant  licensees  to obtain  minimum
property insurance  coverage of $1.06 billion or the amount generally  available
from private  sources,  whichever is less.  The proceeds of this  insurance  are
required to be used first to ensure that the  licensed  reactor is in a safe and
stable  condition and can be  maintained in that  condition so as to prevent any
significant   risk  to  the  public  health  and  safety.   Within  30  days  of
stabilization,  the  licensee  is  required  to prepare  and submit to the NRC a
cleanup  plan for  approval.  The  plan is  required  to  identify  all  cleanup
operations  necessary to  decontaminate  the reactor  sufficiently to permit the
resumption of operations or to commence decommissioning.  Any property insurance
proceeds  not  already  expended  to place  the  reactor  in a safe  and  stable
condition must be used first to complete those  decontamination  operations that
are ordered by the NRC.  The  Companies  are unable to predict what effect these
requirements may have on the availability of insurance proceeds to the Companies
for the Companies' bondholders.

Environmental Matters

          Various federal,  state and local  authorities  regulate the Companies
with  regard  to air and water  quality  and other  environmental  matters.  The
effects of  compliance  on the Companies  with regard to  environmental  matters
could have a material adverse effect on  FirstEnergy's  earnings and competitive
position.  These  environmental  regulations affect  FirstEnergy's  earnings and
competitive  position to the extent that its subsidiaries compete with companies
that are not subject to such  regulations  and therefore do not bear the risk of
costs associated with compliance,  or failure to comply,  with such regulations.
Overall,  FirstEnergy  believes its subsidiaries are in material compliance with
existing  regulations  but is  unable to  predict  future  change in  regulatory
policies  and what,  if any,  the effects of such change  would be.  FirstEnergy
estimates  additional  capital  expenditures  for  environmental  compliance  of
approximately  $91 million for 2004 through 2006,  which is included in the $2.3
billion of forecasted  capital  expenditures  for 2004 through 2006.  Additional
estimated   capital   expenditures   of  $481   million   relating  to  proposed
environmental laws could be required after 2006.

       Clean Air Act Compliance

          FirstEnergy  is required to meet  federally  approved  sulfur  dioxide
(SO2) regulations.  Violations of such regulations can result in shutdown of the
generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to $31,500 for
each day the unit is in violation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
an  interim  enforcement  policy  for SO2  regulations  in Ohio that  allows for
compliance based on a 30-day averaging period. The Companies cannot predict what
action the EPA may take in the future with  respect to the  interim  enforcement
policy.

          FirstEnergy  is complying  with SO2 reduction  requirements  under the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 by burning  lower-sulfur fuel,  generating more
electricity from lower-emitting  plants,  and/or using emission allowances.  NOx
reductions required by the 1990 Amendments are being achieved through combustion
controls and the generation of more  electricity at  lower-emitting  plants.  In
September  1998,  the  EPA  finalized   regulations   requiring  additional  NOx
reductions from the Companies' Ohio and Pennsylvania  facilities.  The EPA's NOx
Transport Rule imposes  uniform  reductions of NOx emissions (an approximate 85%
reduction in utility plant NOx emissions from projected 2007 emissions) across a
region  of  nineteen  states   (including   Michigan,   New  Jersey,   Ohio  and
Pennsylvania)  and the District of Columbia based on a conclusion  that such NOx
emissions  are  contributing  significantly  to ozone  pollution  in the eastern
United States. State Implementation Plans (SIP) must comply by May 31, 2004 with
individual state NOx budgets established by the EPA. New Jersey and Pennsylvania
submitted a SIP that required  compliance with the NOx budgets at the Companies'
New Jersey and Pennsylvania facilities by May 1, 2003. The Companies' New Jersey
and  Pennsylvania  facilities  complied  with  the NOx  budgets  in 2003 and all
facilities will comply with the NOx budgets in 2004 and thereafter. Michigan and
Ohio  submitted  a SIP that  requires  compliance  with the NOx  budgets  at the
Companies' Michigan and Ohio facilities by May 31, 2004.

       National Ambient Air Quality Standards

          In July 1997, the EPA promulgated  changes in the National Ambient Air
Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and proposed a new NAAQS for fine particulate
matter. On December 17, 2003, the EPA proposed the "Interstate Air Quality Rule"
covering a total of 29 states (including New Jersey,  Ohio and Pennsylvania) and
the District of Columbia based on proposed findings that air pollution emissions
from 29 eastern states and the District of Columbia significantly  contribute to
nonattainment of the NAAQS for fine particles and/or the "8-hour" ozone NAAQS in
other  states.  The  EPA  has  proposed  the  Interstate  Air  Quality  Rule  to
"cap-and-trade"  NOx and SO2  emissions in two phases (Phase I in 2010 and Phase
II  in  2015).  According  to  the  EPA,  SO2  emissions  would  be  reduced  by
approximately  3.6 million tons in 2010, across states covered by the rule, with
reductions ultimately reaching more than 5.5 million tons annually. NOx emission
reductions  would measure about 1.5 million tons in 2010 and 1.8 million tons in
2015.  The future cost of  compliance  with these  proposed  regulations  may be
substantial  and will depend on whether and how they are ultimately  implemented
by the states in which the Companies operate affected facilities.




       Mercury Emissions

          In  December  2000,  the EPA  announced  it  would  proceed  with  the
development of  regulations  regarding  hazardous air  pollutants  from electric
power  plants,  identifying  mercury as the  hazardous air pollutant of greatest
concern.  On December 15, 2003,  the EPA proposed two  different  approaches  to
reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.  The first approach would
require  plants  to  install  controls  known  as  "maximum  achievable  control
technologies" (MACT) based on the type of coal burned.  According to the EPA, if
implemented,  the MACT proposal would reduce  nationwide  mercury emissions from
coal-fired power plants by fourteen tons to  approximately  thirty-four tons per
year. The second  approach  proposes a  cap-and-trade  program that would reduce
mercury emissions in two distinct phases. Initially,  mercury emissions would be
reduced by 2010 as a "co-benefits"  from  implementation of SO2 and NOx emission
caps under the EPA's  proposed  Interstate  Air  Quality  Rule.  Phase II of the
mercury  cap-and-trade  program would be  implemented  in 2018 to cap nationwide
mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants at fifteen tons per year. The EPA
has  agreed  to  choose  between  these two  options  and issue a final  rule by
December 15, 2004. The future cost of compliance  with these  regulations may be
substantial.

       W. H. Sammis Plant

          In 1999 and 2000,  the EPA  issued  Notices  of  Violation  (NOV) or a
Compliance Order to nine utilities covering 44 power plants, including the W. H.
Sammis  Plant.  In addition,  the U.S.  Department  of Justice filed eight civil
complaints against various investor-owned utilities,  which included a complaint
against OE and Penn in the U.S.  District  Court for the  Southern  District  of
Ohio.  The NOV and  complaint  allege  violations  of the Clean Air Act based on
operation  and  maintenance  of the W. H. Sammis Plant dating back to 1984.  The
complaint  requests  permanent  injunctive relief to require the installation of
"best available control technology" and civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day
of  violation.  On August 7, 2003,  the  United  States  District  Court for the
Southern District of Ohio ruled that 11 projects  undertaken at the W. H. Sammis
Plant  between 1984 and 1998 required  pre-construction  permits under the Clean
Air Act. The ruling  concludes the liability phase of the case, which deals with
applicability of Prevention of Significant Deterioration provisions of the Clean
Air Act. The remedy  phase,  which is currently  scheduled to be ready for trial
beginning July 19, 2004, will address civil penalties and what, if any,  actions
should be taken to further  reduce  emissions at the plant.  In the ruling,  the
Court  indicated  that the remedies it "may consider and impose  involved a much
broader, equitable analysis, requiring the Court to consider air quality, public
health,  economic  impact,  and  employment  consequences.  The  Court  may also
consider  the less  than  consistent  efforts  of the EPA to apply  and  further
enforce the Clean Air Act." The potential penalties that may be imposed, as well
as the  capital  expenditures  necessary  to comply  with  substantive  remedial
measures  that  may  be  required,  could  have a  material  adverse  impact  on
FirstEnergy's  financial  condition  and results of  operations.  Management  is
unable to predict the ultimate  outcome of this matter and no liability has been
accrued as of December 31, 2003.

       Climate Change

          In December 1997,  delegates to the United Nations'  climate summit in
Japan adopted an agreement,  the Kyoto  Protocol  (Protocol),  to address global
warming by reducing the amount of man-made greenhouse gases emitted by developed
countries  by 5.2% from 1990 levels  between  2008 and 2012.  The United  States
signed the Protocol in 1998 but it failed to receive the two-thirds  vote of the
U.S. Senate required for  ratification.  However,  the Bush  administration  has
committed the United  States to a voluntary  climate  change  strategy to reduce
domestic  greenhouse gas intensity - the ratio of emissions to economic output -
by 18% through 2012.

          We cannot  currently  estimate the financial  impact of climate change
policies  although the potential  restrictions on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
could  require  significant  capital and other  expenditures.  However,  the CO2
emissions per  kilowatt-hour of electricity  generated by the Companies is lower
than many regional  competitors  due to the  Companies'  diversified  generation
sources which includes low or non-CO2 emitting gas-fired and nuclear generators.

       Regulation of Hazardous Waste

          As a result of the Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended,  and the  Toxic  Substances  Control  Act of 1976,  federal  and  state
hazardous  waste   regulations  have  been  promulgated.   Certain   fossil-fuel
combustion waste products,  such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal  requirements  pending  the  EPA's  evaluation  of the need for  future
regulation.  The EPA  subsequently  determined  that regulation of coal ash as a
hazardous  waste is  unnecessary.  In April 2000, the EPA announced that it will
develop national standards  regulating  disposal of coal ash under its authority
to regulate nonhazardous waste.

          The Companies  have been named as  "potentially  responsible  parties"
(PRPs) at waste disposal sites which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive
Environmental  Response,  Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of
disposal of hazardous  substances at historical sites and the liability involved




are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute;  however, federal law provides
that all PRPs for a particular site be held liable on a joint and several basis.
Therefore,  environmental  liabilities  that are  considered  probable have been
recognized on the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003, based on
estimates  of  the  total  costs  of  cleanup,   the  Companies'   proportionate
responsibility  for such costs and the financial ability of other  nonaffiliated
entities to pay. In addition,  JCP&L has accrued  liabilities for  environmental
remediation  of former  manufactured  gas plants in New Jersey;  those costs are
being recovered by JCP&L through a non-bypassable  societal benefits charge. The
Companies have total accrued liabilities  aggregating  approximately $65 million
as of December 31, 2003.

       Clean Water Act

          Various  water  quality  regulations,  the  majority  of which are the
result  of the  federal  Clean  Water  Act  and  its  amendments,  apply  to the
Companies'  plants.  In addition,  Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania  have water
quality standards  applicable to the Companies'  operations.  As provided in the
Clean  Water  Act,  authority  to grant  federal  National  Pollutant  Discharge
Elimination  System water discharge permits can be assumed by a state. Ohio, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania have assumed such authority.

       Summary

          Environmental  controls  are still  developing  and  require,  in many
instances,  balancing  the needs for  additional  quantities of energy in future
years and the need to protect the environment. As a result, the Companies cannot
now  estimate  the precise  effect of existing  and  potential  regulations  and
legislation upon any of their existing and proposed facilities and operations or
upon  their  ability  to issue  additional  first  mortgage  bonds  under  their
respective  mortgages.  These  mortgages  contain  covenants by the Companies to
observe  and  conform  to  all  valid  governmental  requirements  at  the  time
applicable unless in course of contest, and provisions which, in effect, prevent
the  issuance  of  additional  bonds if there is a completed  default  under the
mortgage.  The provisions of each of the mortgages,  in effect, also require, in
the opinion of counsel  for the  respective  Companies,  that  certification  of
property  additions as the basis for the issuance of bonds or other action under
the  mortgages  be  accompanied  by an  opinion  of  counsel  that  the  company
certifying such property additions has all governmental  permissions at the time
necessary  for its  then  current  ownership  and  operation  of  such  property
additions.   The  Companies  intend  to  contest  any  requirements   they  deem
unreasonable  or impossible for  compliance or otherwise  contrary to the public
interest.  Developments  in these and other areas of regulation  may require the
Companies to modify,  supplement or replace  equipment and  facilities,  and may
delay or impede the construction and operation of new facilities, at costs which
could be substantial.

Fuel Supply

          FirstEnergy   currently  has  long-term   coal  contracts  to  provide
approximately  17.4 million  tons for the year 2004.  The  contracts  are shared
among the Companies based on various economic considerations. This contract coal
is produced primarily from mines located in Pennsylvania,  Kentucky, Wyoming and
West Virginia. The contracts expire at various times through December 31, 2021.

          The   Companies   estimate   their  2004  coal   requirements   to  be
approximately 18.7 million tons (OE - 6.4 million, Penn - 7.4 million, CEI - 3.6
million,  and TE - 1.3 million) to be met from the long-term contracts discussed
above  and spot  market  purchases.  See  "Environmental  Matters"  for  factors
pertaining to meeting environmental  regulations affecting coal-fired generating
units.

          CEI,  TE,  OE  and  Penn  have  contracts  for  uranium  material  and
conversion  services  through  2007.  One supplier of natural  uranium  provided
notice  that it will not  deliver  under its  contract  for the year  2004.  The
Companies  will cover this quantity of natural  uranium from other  contracts or
other sources.  The enrichment services are contracted for all of the enrichment
requirements for nuclear fuel through 2006. A portion of enrichment requirements
is also contracted  through 2011.  Fabrication  services for fuel assemblies are
contracted  for the next three  reloads  for Beaver  Valley Unit 1, the next two
reloads  for  Beaver  Valley  Unit  2  (through  approximately  2007  and  2006,
respectively),  the next reload for Davis-Besse (through approximately 2006) and
through the operating  license  period for Perry (through  approximately  2026).
Davis-Besse  fabrication  contract also has an extension  provision for services
through  about 2008.  In addition to the  existing  commitments,  the  Companies
intend to make  additional  arrangements  for the supply of uranium  and for the
subsequent conversion, enrichment, fabrication, and waste disposal services.

          On-site spent fuel storage  facilities are expected to be adequate for
Perry through 2011; facilities at Beaver Valley Units 1 and 2 are expected to be
adequate  through  2015 and 2008,  respectively.  With the  plant  modifications
completed in 2002, Davis-Besse has adequate storage through the remainder of its
operating  license period.  After current on-site storage capacity is exhausted,
additional  storage  capacity  will have to be  obtained  either  through  plant
modifications,   interim   off-site   disposal,   or  permanent  waste  disposal
facilities.  The  Federal  Nuclear  Waste  Policy Act of 1982  provides  for the
construction  of  facilities  for the permanent  disposal of high-level  nuclear
wastes,  including  spent fuel from nuclear  power  plants  operated by electric
utilities.  CEI,  TE, OE and Penn have  contracts  with the U.S.  Department  of
Energy (DOE) for the disposal of spent fuel for Beaver Valley,  Davis-Besse  and
Perry. On February 15, 2002, President Bush approved the DOE's recommendation of
Yucca Mountain for underground disposal of spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power
plants  and high  level  waste  from U.S.  defense  programs.  The  approval  by




President Bush enables the process to proceed to the licensing  phase.  Based on
the  DOE  schedule  published  in  the  July  1999  Draft  Environmental  Impact
Statement,  the  Yucca  Mountain  Repository  is  currently  projected  to start
receiving  spent  fuel  in  2010.  The  Companies   intend  to  make  additional
arrangements  for storage  capacity as a contingency for further delays with the
DOE acceptance of spent fuel for disposal past 2010.

System Capacity and Reserves

          The 2003 net  maximum  hourly  demand for each of the  Companies  was:
OE-6,097 MW (including an additional 272 MW of firm power sales under a contract
which  extends  through  2005) on August 21,  2003;  Penn-952 MW  (including  an
additional  63 MW of firm power sales  under a contract  which  extends  through
2005) on August 14, 2003;  CEI-4,160 MW on June 26, 2003;  TE-2,037 MW on August
25, 2003;  JCP&L-5,645 MW on June 26, 2003;  Met-Ed-2,506 MW on August 21, 2003;
and Penelec-2,661 MW on January 23, 2003.  JCP&L's load was auctioned off in the
New Jersey BGS Auction,  transferring the full 5,100 MW load obligation to other
parties for the period  through July 31, 2004. FES  participated  in the auction
and won a segment of that load.

          Based  on  existing  capacity  plans,  ongoing  arrangements  for firm
purchase contracts, and anticipated term power sales and purchases,  FirstEnergy
has  sufficient  supply  resources  to  meet  load   obligations.   The  current
FirstEnergy  capacity  portfolio  contains  13,387  MW of owned  generation  and
approximately 1,600 MW of long-term purchases from non-utility generators.

          The Companies' sources of generation during 2003 were:

                                          Coal              Nuclear
                                           ----              -------

               OE....................      76.5%              23.5%
               Penn..................      42.0%              58.0%
               CEI...................      69.3%              30.7%
               TE....................      64.0%              36.0%
               Total FirstEnergy.....      68.4%              31.6%

          Any remaining load obligations will be met through a mix of multi-year
forward  purchases,  short-term  forward purchases (less than one year) and spot
market purchases.

Regional Reliability

          The Companies  participate with 24 other electric companies  operating
in nine states in ECAR,  which was organized  for the purpose of furthering  the
reliability  of bulk  power  supply  in the  area  through  coordination  of the
planning  and  operation  by  the  ECAR  members  of  their  bulk  power  supply
facilities.   The  ECAR  members  have  established  principles  and  procedures
regarding  matters affecting the reliability of the bulk power supply within the
ECAR region.  Procedures  have been adopted  regarding:  i) the  evaluation  and
simulated  testing of systems'  performance;  ii) the  establishment  of minimum
levels of daily operating reserves;  iii) the development of a program regarding
emergency  procedures during  conditions of declining system frequency;  and iv)
the basis for uniform rating of generating equipment.

          Following the FirstEnergy/GPU  merger, the transmission  facilities of
JCP&L,  Met-Ed  and  Penelec  continue  to  be  operated  by  PJM.  PJM  is  the
organization  responsible  for the  operation  and control of the bulk  electric
power  system  throughout  major  portions of five  Mid-Atlantic  states and the
District of Columbia.  PJM is dedicated to meeting the reliability  criteria and
standards  of  the  North  American   Electric   Reliability   Council  and  the
Mid-Atlantic Area Council.

Competition

          The  Companies   traditionally   competed  with  other  utilities  for
intersystem bulk power sales and for sales to  municipalities  and cooperatives.
The Companies compete with suppliers of natural gas and other forms of energy in
connection  with their  industrial and commercial  sales and in the home climate
control market, both with respect to new customers and conversions, and with all
other  suppliers  of  electricity.  To  date,  there  has  been  no  substantial
cogeneration by the Companies' customers.




          As a result of the actions taken by state legislative  bodies over the
last few years,  major changes in the electric utility business are occurring in
parts of the United States,  including Ohio, New Jersey and  Pennsylvania  where
FirstEnergy's  utility  subsidiaries  operate.  These  changes have  resulted in
fundamental  alterations in the way traditional integrated utilities and holding
company systems,  like FirstEnergy,  conduct their business.  In accordance with
the Ohio electric utility  restructuring law under which Ohio electric customers
could begin  choosing their electric  generation  suppliers  starting in January
2001,  FirstEnergy  has further  aligned its business units to  accommodate  its
retail strategy and participate in the  competitive  electricity  marketplace in
Ohio. The  organizational  changes deal with the unbundling of electric  utility
services and new ways of conducting business.

          Sales  of  electricity  in   deregulated   markets  are   diversifying
FirstEnergy's  revenue  sources  through our  competitive  subsidiaries in areas
outside  of  the  Companies'  franchise  areas.  This  strategy  has  positioned
FirstEnergy  to compete in the northeast and  mid-Atlantic  region of the United
States - the area targeted by FirstEnergy for growth.  FirstEnergy's competitive
segment  participates in deregulated energy markets in Ohio,  Pennsylvania,  New
Jersey and Michigan.  Currently, FES is providing electric generation service to
customers  within those states.  As  additional  states within the northeast and
mid-Atlantic region of the United States become deregulated, FES is preparing to
enter these markets.

          Competition in Ohio's  electric  generation  began on January 1, 2001.
FirstEnergy moved the operation of the generation portion of its business to its
competitive business unit as reflected in its approved Ohio transition plan. The
Companies  continue  to  provide  generation  services  to  regulated  franchise
customers who have not chosen an alternative,  competitive  generation supplier,
except in New Jersey where  JCP&L's  obligation  to provide BGS has been removed
through a transitional  mechanism of auctioning the obligation  (see "NJBPU Rate
Matters").   In  September   2002,   Met-Ed  and  Penelec   assigned  their  PLR
responsibility to FES through a wholesale power sale agreement.  Under the terms
of the wholesale  agreement,  FES assumed the supply  obligation  and the supply
profit  and  loss  risk,  for the  portion  of  power  supply  requirements  not
self-supplied  by  Met-Ed  and  Penelec.  The  agreement  will be  automatically
extended on an annual basis  unless any party elects to cancel the  agreement by
November  1  of  the  preceding  year  (see  "PPUC  Rate  Matters"  for  further
discussion).  The Ohio Companies and Penn obtain their generation  through power
supply  agreements  with FES. In addition  to electric  generation,  FES is also
competing  in  deregulated  natural  gas  markets  as  well  as  offering  other
energy-related products and services.

Research and Development

          The  Companies  participate  in funding the  Electric  Power  Research
Institute  (EPRI),  which was  formed  for the  purpose  of  expanding  electric
research  and  development  under  the  voluntary  sponsorship  of the  nation's
electric  utility  industry - public,  private and  cooperative.  Its goal is to
mutually  benefit  utilities and their customers by promoting the development of
new and  improved  technologies  to help the utility  industry  meet present and
future  electric energy needs in  environmentally  and  economically  acceptable
ways.  EPRI conducts  research on all aspects of electric  power  production and
use, including fuels, generation,  delivery, energy management and conservation,
environmental  effects and energy  analysis.  The major portion of EPRI research
and  development  projects  is directed  toward  practical  solutions  and their
applications to problems  currently  facing the electric  utility  industry.  In
2003,  approximately 45% of the Companies' research and development expenditures
were related to EPRI.





Executive Officers

          The executive officers are elected at the annual organization  meeting
of the  Board of  Directors,  held  immediately  after  the  annual  meeting  of
stockholders,  and hold office until the next such organization meeting,  unless
the Board of Directors  shall  otherwise  determine,  or unless a resignation is
submitted.


Mrs. Vespoli and Messrs. Alexander, Marsh and Wagner are the executive officers,
as noted above,  of OE,  Penn,  CEI, TE,  Met-Ed and Penelec.  Mrs.  Vespoli and
Messrs. Marsh, Morgan and Wagner are the executive officers of JCP&L.

*  Indicates position held at least since January 1, 1999.
** Mr. Alexander was elected "Acting Chief Executive Officer" on December 22,
   2003 when H. Peter Burg, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, began a
   medical leave of absence. Mr. Alexander was elected Chief Executive Officer
   effective January 20, 2004, succeeding Mr. Burg, who passed away on January
   13, 2004.


           As of January 1, 2004, FirstEnergy's nonutility subsidiaries and the
Companies had a total of 15,905 employees located in the United States as
follows: FirstEnergy-2,677, OE-1,320, CEI-949, TE-446, Penn-201, JCP&L-1,557,
Met-Ed-659, Penelec-887, ATSI-31, FES-2,078, FENOC-2,954, FSG-2,042, and First

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

          The Companies' respective first mortgage indentures constitute, in the
opinion of the Companies'  counsel,  direct first liens on substantially  all of
the  respective   Companies'   physical  property,   subject  only  to  excepted
encumbrances,  as defined in the indentures.  See "Leases" and  "Capitalization"
notes to the respective financial  statements for information  concerning leases
and financing encumbrances affecting certain of the Companies' properties.

          The Companies own, individually or together as tenants in common,
and/or lease, the generating units in service as of March 1, 2004, shown on the
table below.



          Prolonged outages of existing generating units might make it necessary
for the  Companies,  depending  upon the demand for electric  service upon their
system,  to use to a greater  extent than  otherwise,  less  efficient  and less
economic generating units, or purchased power, and in some cases may require the
reduction  of load  during  peak  periods  under  the  Companies'  interruptible
programs, all to an extent not presently determinable.

          The Companies'  generating  plants and load centers are connected by a
transmission  system  consisting  of elements  having  various  voltage  ratings
ranging  from  23  kV  to  345  kV.  The  Companies'  overhead  and  underground
transmission lines aggregate 14,944 pole miles.




          The Companies' electric  distribution systems include 112,709 miles of
overhead  pole line and  underground  conduit  carrying  primary,  secondary and
street  lighting   circuits.   They  own  substations  with  a  total  installed
transformer capacity of 91,822,000 kilovolt-amperes.

          The  transmission  facilities that are owned and operated by ATSI also
interconnect with those of AEP, DPL, Duquesne,  Allegheny,  MEC and Penelec. The
transmission   facilities   of  JCP&L,   Met-Ed  and  Penelec   are   physically
interconnected and are operated on an integrated basis as part of the PJM RTO.

           FirstEnergy's distribution and transmission systems as of December
31, 2003, consist of the following:

                                                                     Substation

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

          Each registrant's  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have  reviewed  and  evaluated  such   registrant's   disclosure   controls  and
procedures,  as defined in the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 Rules  13a-15(e)
and  15d-15(e),  as of the end date  covered  by this  report.  Based  upon this
evaluation,  the respective Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, except as described below, such registrant's disclosure controls
and procedures are effective.

          During the  fourth  quarter of 2003,  management  identified  expenses
recognized  during the first three  quarters of 2003 related to activities  that
should have been recorded as capital  expenditures as a result of untimely table
updates in the  registrants'  automated work management  system and inconsistent
application of the allocation of costs to capital  projects in the  registrants'
work management system.

          Management  believes that this condition,  which has been defined as a
material  weakness,  was  attributable to employee  training and process changes
that were not  uniformly  applied in  connection  with the  registrants'  recent
implementation of a new Enterprise  Resource  Planning system. As a result,  the
quarterly financial results for JCP&L, Penelec and TE have been restated in each
registrant's respective annual reports.

          As  discussed  below,  management  has  corrected  this  condition  by
strengthening the registrants' internal control procedures.

(b)  Changes in Internal Controls

          During the quarter ended December 31, 2003, management implemented the
following measures to correct the condition discussed above:

          1.   Increased  training  of  field  employees  regarding  the  proper
               accounting for capital and expense projects;
          2.   Established   procedures   to  ensure  that  tables   within  the
               registrants'  automated work  management  system are updated on a
               timely basis; and
          3.   Reconfigured the registrants' automated work management system to
               identify the proper allocation of capital and expense projects.

          Except for the changes noted above, there were no other changes in the
registrants' internal controls over the financial reporting that have materially
affected,  or are  reasonably  likely to  materially  affect,  the  registrants'
internal control over financial reporting.

Our audits of the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to in our report

for the periods  from  January 1, 2001 to November 6, 2001 and from  November 7,
2001 to December 31, 2001,  included in Jersey  Central Power & Light  Company's
Annual Report to  Stockholders  incorporated  by reference in this Form 10-K and
have issued our report  thereon dated March 18, 2002. Our audit was made for the
purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole. The schedule
of  consolidated  valuation  and  qualifying  accounts  listed in Item 14 is the
responsibility  of the Company's  management and is presented for the purpose of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of
the basic consolidated  financial  statements.  The information included in this
schedule for the year ended December 31, 2001 has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic consolidated  financial  statements
and, in our opinion,  fairly states in all material  respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements  taken  as a  whole.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  as of
December 31, 2000 and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31,
2000,  together with the related  information  included in this  schedule,  were
audited by other  auditors  whose  report dated  January 31, 2001,  expressed an
unqualified opinion.

                        Report of Independent Auditors on
                          Financial Statement Schedules



To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Metropolitan Edison Company:

Our audits of the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to in our report
dated February 25, 2004 appearing in the 2003 Annual Report to  Stockholders  of
Metropolitan Edison Company (which report and consolidated  financial statements
are  incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) also included
an audit of the financial  statement  schedules for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002 listed in Item 15(a)(2) of this Form 10-K.  In our opinion,  these
financial  statement  schedules  present fairly, in all material  respects,  the
information  set  forth  therein  when  read in  conjunction  with  the  related
consolidated   financial   statements.   The  financial  statement  schedule  of
Metropolitan  Edison Company for the year ended December 31, 2001 was audited by
other  independent  auditors  who  have  ceased  operations.  Those  independent
auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on the financial statement schedule in
their report dated March 18, 2002.
