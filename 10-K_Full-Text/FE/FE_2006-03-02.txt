ITEM
      1.
      BUSINESS

The
      Company

FirstEnergy
      Corp.
      was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1996. FirstEnergy’s
      principal business is the holding, directly or indirectly, of all of the
      outstanding common stock of its eight principal electric utility operating
      subsidiaries: OE, CEI, TE, Penn, ATSI, JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec. 
FirstEnergy’s consolidated revenues are primarily derived from electric service
      provided by its utility operating subsidiaries and the revenues of its other
      principal subsidiaries: FES; FSG; NGC and MYR. In addition, FirstEnergy holds
      all of the outstanding common stock of other direct subsidiaries including:
      FirstEnergy Properties, Inc., FirstEnergy Ventures Corp., FENOC, FirstEnergy
      Securities Transfer Company, GPU Diversified Holdings, LLC, GPU Telecom
      Services, Inc., GPU Nuclear, Inc. and FESC.

The
      Companies’
combined service areas encompass approximately 36,100 square miles in Ohio,
      New
      Jersey and Pennsylvania. The areas they serve have a combined population of
      approximately 11.2 million.

OE
      was organized
      under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1930 and owns property and does business
      as an electric public utility in that state. OE engages in the distribution
      and
      sale of electric energy to communities in a 7,500 square mile area of central
      and northeastern Ohio. The area it serves has a population of approximately
      2.8
      million.

OE
      owns all of
      Penn’s outstanding common stock. Penn was organized under the laws of the
      Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1930 and owns property and does business as
      an
      electric public utility in that state. Penn is also authorized to do business
      in
      the State of Ohio (see Item 2 - Properties). Penn furnishes electric service
      to
      communities in a 1,500 square mile area of western Pennsylvania. The area served
      by Penn has a population of approximately 0.3 million.

CEI
      was organized
      under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1892 and does business as an electric
      public utility in that state. CEI engages in the distribution and sale of
      electric energy in an area of approximately 1,700 square miles in northeastern
      Ohio. The area CEI serves has a population of approximately
      1.9 million.

TE
      was organized
      under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1901 and does business as an electric
      public utility in that state. TE engages in the distribution and sale of
      electric energy in an area of approximately 2,500 square miles in northwestern
      Ohio. The area TE serves has a population of approximately
      0.8 million.

ATSI
      was organized
      under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1998. ATSI owns transmission assets
      that
      were formerly owned by the Ohio Companies and Penn. ATSI owns and operates
      major, high-voltage transmission facilities, which consist of approximately
      7,100 circuit miles (5,814 pole miles) of transmission lines with nominal
      voltages of 345 kV, 138 kV and 69 kV. There are 37 interconnections with
      six neighboring control areas. ATSI’s transmission system offers gateways into
      the East through high capacity ties with PJM through Penelec, Duquesne Light
      Company and Allegheny Energy, Inc. into the North through multiple 345 kV
      high capacity ties with MEC, and into the South through ties with AEP and DPL.
      ATSI is the control area operator for the Ohio Companies and Penn service areas.
      ATSI plans, operates and maintains the transmission system in accordance with
      the requirements of the NERC and applicable regulatory agencies to ensure
      reliable service to FirstEnergy’s customers (see Transmission Rate Matters for a
      discussion of ATSI’s participation in the MISO).

JCP&L
      was
      organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey in 1925 and owns property
      and does business as an electric public utility in that state. JCP&L
      provides transmission and distribution services in northern, western and east
      central New Jersey. The area JCP&L serves has a population of approximately
      2.5 million.

Met-Ed
      was organized
      under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1922 and owns property
      and
      does business as an electric public utility in that state. Met-Ed provides
      transmission and distribution services in eastern and south central
      Pennsylvania. The area it serves has a population of approximately
      1.2 million.

Penelec
      was
      organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1919 and owns
      property and does business as an electric public utility in that state. Penelec
      provides transmission and distribution services in western, northern and south
      central Pennsylvania. The area it serves has a population of approximately
      1.7 million. Penelec, as lessee of the property of its subsidiary, The
      Waverly Electric Light & Power Company, also serves a population of about
      8,400 in Waverly, New York and its vicinity.


FES
      was organized
      under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1997 and provides energy-related products
      and services, and through its FGCO subsidiary, owns and operates FirstEnergy’s
      non-nuclear generation businesses (see Generation Asset Transfers below). FENOC
      was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1998 and operates nuclear
      generating facilities. FSG is the parent company of several HVAC and energy
      management companies; MYR is a utility infrastructure construction service
      company. FESC provides legal, financial and other corporate support services
      to
      affiliated FirstEnergy companies.

NGC was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio for the purpose of owning
      the nuclear generation assets transferred from the Ohio Companies and Penn
      in
      furtherance of those subsidiaries’ restructuring plans that were approved by the
      PUCO and, in the case of Penn, the PPUC. The intra-system transfer of nuclear
      generating assets was completed on December 16, 2005. The nuclear
      generating plant interests transferred do not include leasehold interests of
      OE
      and TE in certain of the nuclear plants that are subject to sale and leaseback
      arrangements with non-affiliates. NGC will sell all capacity, energy and
      ancillary services available from the transferred nuclear assets, as well as
      those related to the OE and TE leasehold interests and supplied to NGC pursuant
      to a power supply agreement with those companies, to FES pursuant to a power
      sale agreement for subsequent resale to wholesale and retail customers. FENOC
      operates and maintains the nuclear assets owned by NGC. NGC is a direct wholly
      owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy.

Reference
      is made to
      Note 16, Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements contained in Item 8 for information regarding FirstEnergy's
      reportable segments.

Generation
      Asset Transfers

On
      May 13,
      2005, Penn, and on May 18, 2005, the Ohio Companies entered into certain
      agreements implementing a series of intra-system generation asset transfers
      that
      were completed in the fourth quarter 2005. The asset transfers resulted in
      the
      respective undivided ownership interests of the Ohio Companies and Penn in
      FirstEnergy’s nuclear and non-nuclear generation assets being owned by NGC, and
      FGCO, respectively. The generating plant interests transferred do not include
      leasehold interests of CEI, TE and OE in certain of the plants that are
      currently subject to sale and leaseback arrangements with non-affiliates.

On
      October 24,
      2005, the Ohio Companies and Penn completed the intra-system transfer of
      non-nuclear generation assets to FGCO. Prior to the transfer, FGCO, as lessee
      under a Master Facility Lease with the Ohio Companies and Penn, leased, operated
      and maintained the non-nuclear generation assets that it now owns. The asset
      transfers were consummated pursuant to FGCO’s purchase option under the Master
      Facility Lease.

On
      December 16,
      2005, the Ohio Companies and Penn completed the intra-system transfer of their
      respective interests in the nuclear generation assets to NGC through, in the
      case of OE and Penn, a spin-off by way of dividend and, in the case of CEI
      and
      TE, a sale at net book value. FENOC continues to operate and maintain the
      nuclear generation assets.

These
      transactions
      were undertaken pursuant to the Ohio Companies’ and Penn’s restructuring plans
      that were approved by the PUCO and the PPUC, respectively, under applicable
      Ohio
      and Pennsylvania electric utility restructuring legislation. Consistent with
      the
      restructuring plans, generation assets that had been owned by the Ohio Companies
      and Penn were required to be separated from the regulated delivery business
      of
      those companies through transfer to a separate corporate entity. The
      transactions essentially completed the divestitures of owned assets contemplated
      by the restructuring plans by transferring the ownership interests to NGC and
      FGCO without impacting the operation of the plants.

Divestitures

In 2005, FirstEnergy sold three FSG subsidiaries - Pennsylvania-based
      Elliott-Lewis Corporation, Ohio-based Spectrum Control Systems, Inc. and
      Maryland-based L. H. Cranston and Sons, Inc. - and a MYR subsidiary - Power
      Piping Company, resulting in an aggregate after-tax gain of $13 million.
      All of these sales, with the exception of L. H. Cranston and Sons, Inc. met
      the discontinued operations criteria.

In March 2005, FES completed the sale of its retail natural gas business for
      an
      after-tax gain of $5 million. Also in March 2005, FirstEnergy sold 51% of
      its interest in FirstCom, resulting in an after-tax gain of $4 million.
      FirstEnergy accounts for its remaining 31.85% interest in FirstCom on the equity
      basis.


Utility
      Regulation

On August 8, 2005 President Bush signed into law the EPACT. This law has
      far reaching implications that will affect various aspects of electric
      generation, transmission and distribution. One of the most significant
      provisions of the new legislation gives the FERC authority to certify ERO that
      will establish and enforce mandatory bulk power liability standards, subject
      to
      FERC review and approval. The EPACT repealed PUHCA effective February 2006.
      PUHCA imposed financial and operational restrictions on many aspects of our
      business. Some of PUHCA’s consumer protection authority will be transferred to
      FERC and state utility commissions. FERC will now exercise authority over the
      issuance of certain securities and the assumption of certain liabilities. The
      EPACT also provides for tax credits for the development of certain clean coal
      and emissions technologies.

Each
      of the
      Companies’ retail rates, conditions of service, issuance of securities and other
      matters are also subject to regulation in the state in which each operates
      -
      Ohio by the PUCO, New Jersey by the NJBPU and in Pennsylvania by the PPUC.
      With
      respect to their wholesale and interstate electric operations and rates, the
      Companies are subject to regulation, including regulation of their accounting
      policies and practices, by the FERC. Under Ohio law, municipalities may regulate
      rates, subject to appeal to the PUCO if not acceptable to the
      utility.

Regulatory
      Accounting

The Companies
      and ATSI recognize, as regulatory assets, costs which the FERC, PUCO, PPUC
      and
      NJBPU have authorized for recovery from customers in future periods or for
      which
      authorization is probable. Without the probability of such authorization, costs
      currently recorded as regulatory assets would have been charged to income as
      incurred. All regulatory assets are expected to be recovered from customers
      under the Companies' respective transition and regulatory plans. Based on those
      plans, the Companies continue to bill and collect cost-based rates for their
      transmission and distribution services, which remain regulated; accordingly,
      it
      is appropriate that the Companies continue the application of SFAS 71 to
      those operations.

FirstEnergy
      accounts
      for the effects of regulation through the application of SFAS 71 to its
      operating utilities since their rates:

An
      enterprise
      meeting all of these criteria capitalizes costs that would otherwise be charged
      to expense if the rate actions of its regulator make it probable that those
      costs will be recovered in future revenue. SFAS 71 is applied only to the
      parts of the business that meet the above criteria. If a portion of the business
      applying SFAS 71 no longer meets those requirements, previously recorded
      regulatory assets are removed from the balance sheet in accordance with the
      guidance in SFAS 101.

In
      Ohio,
      Pennsylvania and New Jersey, laws applicable to electric industry restructuring
      contain similar provisions that are reflected in the Companies’ respective state
      regulatory plans. These provisions include:


Reliability
      Initiatives

In
      late
      2003 and early 2004, a series of letters, reports and recommendations were
      issued from various entities, including governmental, industry and ad hoc
      reliability entities (PUCO, FERC, NERC and the U.S. - Canada Power System Outage
      Task Force) regarding enhancements to regional reliability. In 2004, FirstEnergy
      completed implementation of all actions and initiatives related to enhancing
      area reliability, improving voltage and reactive management, operator readiness
      and training and emergency response preparedness recommended for completion
      in
      2004. On July 14, 2004, NERC independently verified that FirstEnergy had
      implemented the various initiatives to be completed by June 30 or summer
      2004, with minor exceptions noted by FirstEnergy, which exceptions are now
      essentially complete. FirstEnergy is proceeding with the implementation of
      the
      recommendations that were to be completed subsequent to 2004 and will continue
      to periodically assess the FERC-ordered Reliability Study recommendations for
      forecasted 2009 system conditions, recognizing revised load forecasts and other
      changing system conditions which may impact the recommendations. Thus far,
      implementation of the recommendations has not required, nor is expected to
      require, substantial investment in new, or material upgrades to existing
      equipment. The FERC or other applicable government agencies and reliability
      coordinators may, however, take a different view as to recommended enhancements
      or may recommend additional enhancements in the future as the result of adoption
      of mandatory reliability standards pursuant to the EPACT that could require
      additional, material expenditures. Finally, the PUCO is continuing to review
      the
      FirstEnergy filing that addressed upgrades to control room computer hardware
      and
      software and enhancements to the training of control room operators, before
      determining the next steps, if any, in the proceeding.

As
      a result of outages experienced in JCP&L’s service area in 2002 and 2003,
      the NJBPU had implemented reviews into JCP&L’s service reliability. In 2004,
      the NJBPU adopted an MOU that set out specific tasks related to service
      reliability to be performed by JCP&L and a timetable for completion and
      endorsed JCP&L’s ongoing actions to implement the MOU. On June 9, 2004,
      the NJBPU approved a Stipulation that incorporates the final report of a Special
      Reliability Master who made recommendations on appropriate courses of action
      necessary to ensure system-wide reliability. The Stipulation also incorporates
      the Executive Summary and Recommendation portions of the final report of a
      focused audit of JCP&L’s Planning and Operations and Maintenance programs
      and practices (Focused Audit). A final order in the Focused Audit docket was
      issued by the NJBPU on July 23, 2004. On February 11, 2005, JCP&L
      met with the Ratepayer Advocate to discuss reliability improvements. JCP&L
      continues to file compliance reports reflecting activities associated with
      the
      MOU and Stipulation.

In
      May 2004, the
      PPUC issued an order approving revised reliability benchmarks and standards,
      including revised benchmarks and standards for Met-Ed, Penelec and Penn. Met-Ed,
      Penelec and Penn filed a Petition for Amendment of Benchmarks with the PPUC
      on
      May 26, 2004, due to their implementation of automated outage management
      systems following restructuring. On December 30, 2005 the ALJ recommended
      that the PPUC adopt the Joint Petition for Settlement among the parties involved
      in the three Companies’ request to amend the distribution reliability
      benchmarks, thereby eliminating the need for full litigation. The ALJ’s
      recommendation, adopting the revised benchmarks and standards was approved
      by
      the PPUC on February 9, 2006.

The
      EPACT provides
      for the creation of an ERO to establish and enforce reliability standards for
      the bulk power system, subject to FERC review. On February 3, 2006, the
      FERC adopted a rule establishing certification requirements for the ERO, as
      well
      as regional entities envisioned to assume monitoring responsibility for the
      new
      reliability standards.

The
      NERC has been
      preparing the implementation aspects of reorganizing its structure to meet
      the
      FERC’s certification requirements for the ERO. The NERC will make a filing with
      the FERC to obtain certification as the ERO and to obtain FERC approval of
      delegation agreements with regional entities. The new FERC rule referred to
      above, further provides for reorganizing regional reliability organizations
      (regional entities) that would replace the current regional councils and for
      rearranging the relationship with the ERO. The “regional entity” may be
      delegated authority by the ERO, subject to FERC approval, for enforcing
      reliability standards adopted by the ERO and approved by the FERC. NERC also
      intends to make a parallel filing with the FERC seeking approval of mandatory
      reliability standards.

These
      reliability
      standards are expected to be based on the current NERC Version 0 reliability
      standards with some additional standards.

The
      two filings are
      expected to be made in the second quarter of 2006.

The
      ECAR,
      Mid-Atlantic Area Council, and Mid-American Interconnected Network reliability
      councils have completed the consolidation of these regions into a single new
      regional reliability organization known as ReliabilityFirst Corporation.
      ReliabilityFirst began operations as a regional reliability council under NERC
      on January 1, 2006 and intends to file and obtain certification consistent
      with the final rule as a “regional entity” under the ERO during 2006. All of
      FirstEnergy’s facilities are located within the ReliabilityFirst
      region.

On
      a
      parallel path, the NERC is establishing working groups to develop reliability
      standards to be filed for approval with the FERC following the NERC’s
      certification as an ERO. These reliability standards are expected to build
      on
      the current NERC Version 0 reliability standards. It is expected that the
      proposed reliability standards will be filed with the FERC in early
      2006.


We
      believe that we
      are in compliance with all current NERC reliability standards. However, it
      is
      expected that the FERC will adopt stricter reliability standards than those
      contained in the current NERC Version 0 standards. The financial impact of
      complying with the new standards cannot be determined at this time. However,
      the
      EPACT required that all prudent costs incurred to comply with the new
      reliability standards be recovered in rates.

PUCO
      Rate
      Matters

On
      August 5,
      2004, the Ohio Companies accepted the RSP as modified and approved by the PUCO
      in an August 4, 2004 Entry on Rehearing, subject to a competitive bid
      process. The RSP was intended to establish generation service rates beginning
      January 1, 2006, in response to PUCO concerns about price and supply
      uncertainty following the end of the Ohio Companies' transition plan market
      development period. In October 2004, the OCC and NOAC filed appeals with the
      Supreme Court of Ohio to overturn the original June 9, 2004 PUCO order in
      this proceeding as well as the associated entries on rehearing. On
      September 28, 2005, the Ohio Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the
      appeals and it is expected that the Court will issue its opinion in 2006. On
      November 1, 2005, the Ohio Companies filed tariffs in compliance with the
      approved RSP, which were approved by the PUCO on December 7,
      2005.

On
      May 27,
      2005, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO to establish a
      GCAF
      rider under the RSP. The GCAF application sought recovery of increased fuel
      costs from 2006 through 2008 applicable to the Ohio Companies' retail customers
      through a tariff rider to be implemented January 1, 2006. The application
      reflected projected increases in fuel costs in 2006 compared to 2002 baseline
      costs. The new rider, after adjustments made in testimony, sought to recover
      all
      costs above the baseline (approximately $88 million in 2006). Various
      parties including the OCC intervened in this case and the case was consolidated
      with the RCP application discussed below.

On
      September 9,
      2005, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO that supplemented
      their existing RSP with an RCP which was designed to provide customers with
      more
      certain rate levels than otherwise available under the RSP during the plan
      period. Major provisions of the RCP include:

·

Maintain
                the
                existing level of base distribution rates through December 31, 2008
                for OE and TE, and April 30, 2009 for
                CEI;

·

Defer
                and
                capitalize for future recovery with carrying charges certain distribution
                costs to be incurred during the period January 1, 2006 through
                December 31, 2008, not to exceed $150 million in each of the
                three years;

·

Adjust
                the RTC
                and extended RTC recovery periods and rate levels so that full recovery
                of
                authorized costs will occur as of December 31, 2008 for OE and TE as
                of December 31, 2010 for CEI;

·

Reduce
                the
                deferred shopping incentive balances as of January 1, 2006 by up to
                $75 million for OE, $45 million for TE, and $85 million for
                CEI by accelerating the application of each respective company's
                accumulated cost of removal regulatory liability;
                and

·

Recover
                increased fuel costs of up to $75 million, $77 million, and
                $79 million, in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, from all OE and
                TE distribution and transmission customers through a fuel recovery
                mechanism. OE, TE, and CEI may defer and capitalize increased fuel
                costs
                above the amount collected through the fuel recovery mechanism (in
                lieu of
                implementation of the GCAF rider).

On November 4, 2005, a supplemental stipulation was filed with the PUCO
      which was in addition to a stipulation filed with the September 9, 2005
      application. On January 4, 2006, the PUCO approved the RCP filing with
      modifications. On January 10, 2006, the Ohio Companies filed a Motion for
      Clarification of the PUCO order approving the RCP. The Ohio Companies sought
      clarity on issues related to distribution deferrals, including requirements
      of
      the review process, timing for recognizing certain deferrals and definitions
      of
      the types of qualified expenditures. The Ohio Companies also sought confirmation
      that the list of deferrable distribution expenditures originally included in
      the
      revised stipulation fall within the PUCO order definition of qualified
      expenditures. On January 25, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry on Rehearing
      granting in part, and denying in part, the Ohio Companies’ previous requests and
      clarifying issues referred to above. The Commission granted the Ohio Companies’
requests to: 1) recognize fuel and distribution deferrals commencing
      January 1, 2006; 2) recognize distribution deferrals on a monthly basis
      prior to review by the Commission Staff; 3) clarify that the types of
      distribution expenditures included in the Supplemental Stipulation may be
      deferred; and 4) clarify that distribution expenditures do not have to be
“accelerated” in order to be deferred. The Commission granted the Ohio
      Companies’ methodology for determining distribution deferral amounts, but denied
      the Motion in that the Commission Staff must verify the level of distribution
      expenditures contained in current rates, as opposed to simply accepting the
      amounts contained in the Companies’ Motion. On February 3, 2006, several
      other parties filed applications for rehearing on the PUCO's January 4,
      2006 Order. The Ohio Companies responded to the application for rehearing on
      February 13, 2006.


Under
      provisions of
      the RSP, the PUCO may require the Ohio Companies to undertake, no more often
      than annually, a competitive bid process to secure generation for the years
      and 2008. On July 22, 2005, FirstEnergy filed a competitive bid process for
      the period beginning in 2007 that is similar to the competitive bid process
      approved by the PUCO for the Ohio Companies in 2004, which resulted in the
      PUCO
      accepting no bids. Any acceptance of future competitive bid results would
      terminate the RSP pricing, with no accounting impacts to the RSP, and not until
      twelve months after the PUCO authorizes such termination. On September 28,
      2005, the PUCO issued an Entry that essentially approved the Ohio Companies'
      filing but delayed the proposed timing of the competitive bid process by four
      months, calling for the auction to be held on March 21, 2006. OCC filed an
      application for rehearing of the September 28, 2005 Entry, which the PUCO
      denied on November 22, 2005. On February 23, 2006, the auction manager
      notified the PUCO that there was insufficient interest in the auction process
      to
      allow it to proceed in 2006

.

On
      December 30,
      2004, the Ohio Companies filed with the PUCO two applications related to the
      recovery of transmission and ancillary service related costs. The first
      application sought recovery of these costs beginning January 1, 2006. The
      Ohio Companies requested that these costs be recovered through a rider that
      would be effective on January 1, 2006 and adjusted each July 1
      thereafter. The PUCO approved the settlement stipulation on August 31,
      2005. The incremental transmission and ancillary service revenues expected
      to be
      recovered from January through June 2006 are approximately $66 million.
      This amount includes the recovery of the 2005 deferred MISO expenses as
      described below. In May 2006, the Companies will file a modification to the
      rider to determine revenues from July 2006 through June 2007.

The
      second
      application sought authority to defer costs associated with transmission and
      ancillary service related costs incurred during the period from October 1,
      2003 through December 31, 2005. On May 18, 2005, the PUCO granted the
      accounting authority for the Ohio Companies to defer incremental transmission
      and ancillary service-related charges incurred as a participant in MISO, but
      only for those costs incurred during the period December 30, 2004 through
      December 31, 2005. Permission to defer costs incurred prior to
      December 30, 2004 was denied. The PUCO also authorized the Ohio Companies
      to accrue carrying charges on the deferred balances. On August 31, 2005,
      the OCC appealed the PUCO's decision. All briefs have been filed. A motion
      to
      dismiss filed on behalf of the PUCO is currently pending. Unless the court
      grants the motion, the appeal will be set for oral argument, which should be
      heard in the third or fourth quarter of 2006.

On
      January 20,
      2006 the OCC sought rehearing of the PUCO approval of the rider recovery during
      the period January 1, 2006 through June 30, 2006, as that amount
      pertains to recovery of the deferred costs. The PUCO denied the OCC's
      application on February 6, 2006. The OCC has sixty days from that date to
      appeal the PUCO's approval of the rider.

PPUC
      Rate
      Matters

A
      February 2002
      Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania decision affirmed the June 2001 PPUC decision
      regarding approval of the FirstEnergy/GPU merger, remanded the issues of
      quantification and allocation of merger savings to the PPUC and denied Met-Ed
      and Penelec the rate relief initially approved in the PPUC decision. On
      October 2, 2003, the PPUC issued an order concluding that the Commonwealth
      Court reversed the PPUC’s June 2001 order in its entirety. In accordance
      with the PPUC's direction, Met-Ed and Penelec filed supplements to their tariffs
      that became effective in October 2003 and that reflected the CTC rates and
      shopping credits in effect prior to the June 2001 order.

Met-Ed
      and Penelec
      had been negotiating with interested parties in an attempt to resolve the merger
      savings issues that are the subject of remand from the Commonwealth Court.
      Met-Ed’s and Penelec’s combined portion of total merger savings during 2001 -
      2004 is estimated to be approximately $51 million. In late 2005, settlement
      discussions broke off as unsuccessful. A procedural schedule was established
      by
      the ALJ on January 17, 2006. The companies’ initial testimony is due on
      March 1, 2006 with testimony of the other parties and additional testimony
      by the companies to be filed through October, 2006. Hearings are scheduled
      for
      the end of October 2006 with the ALJ’s recommended decision to be issued in
      February 2007. The companies are unable to predict the outcome of this
      proceeding.

In
      an
      October 16, 2003 order, the PPUC approved September 30, 2004 as the
      date for Met-Ed's and Penelec's NUG trust fund refunds. The PPUC order also
      denied their accounting treatment request regarding the CTC rate/shopping credit
      swap by requiring Met-Ed and Penelec to treat the stipulated CTC rates that
      were
      in effect from January 1, 2002 on a retroactive basis. On October 22,
      2003, Met-Ed and Penelec filed an Objection with the Commonwealth Court asking
      that the Court reverse this PPUC finding; a Commonwealth Court judge
      subsequently denied their Objection on October 27, 2003 without
      explanation. On October 31, 2003, Met-Ed and Penelec filed an Application
      for Clarification of the Court order with the judge, a Petition for Review
      of
      the PPUC's October 2 and October 16, 2003 Orders, and an application
      for reargument, if the judge, in his clarification order, indicates that
      Met-Ed's and Penelec's Objection was intended to be denied on the merits. The
      Reargument Brief before the Commonwealth Court was filed on January 28,
      2005.


As
      of
      December 31, 2005, Met-Ed's and Penelec's regulatory deferrals pursuant to
      the 1998 Restructuring Settlement (including the Phase 2 Proceedings) and the
      FirstEnergy/GPU Merger Settlement Stipulation are $333 million and
      $48 million, respectively. Penelec's $48 million is subject to the
      pending resolution of taxable income issues associated with NUG Trust Fund
      proceeds.

Met-Ed
      and Penelec
      purchase a portion of their PLR requirements from FES through a wholesale power
      sales agreement and a portion from contracts with unaffiliated third party
      suppliers, including NUGs. Assuming continuation of these existing contractual
      arrangements, the available supply represents approximately 100% of the combined
      retail sales obligations of Met-Ed and Penelec in 2006 and 2007; almost 100%
      for
      2008; and approximately 85% for 2009 and 2010. Met-Ed and Penelec are authorized
      to defer any excess of NUG contract costs over current market prices. Under
      the
      terms of the wholesale agreement with FES, FES retains the supply obligation
      and
      the supply profit and loss risk for the portion of power supply requirements
      not
      self-supplied by Met-Ed and Penelec under their contracts with NUGs and other
      unaffiliated suppliers. This arrangement reduces Met-Ed's and Penelec's exposure
      to high wholesale power prices by providing power at a fixed price for their
      uncommitted PLR energy costs during the term of the agreement with FES. The
      wholesale agreement with FES is automatically extended for each successive
      calendar year unless any party elects to cancel the agreement by November 1
      of
      the preceding year. On November 1, 2005, FES and the other parties thereto
      amended the agreement to provide FES the right over the next year to terminate
      the agreement at any time upon 60 days notice. If the wholesale power agreement
      were terminated or modified, Met-Ed and Penelec would need to satisfy the
      portion of their PLR obligations currently supplied by FES from unaffiliated
      suppliers at prevailing prices, which are likely to be higher than the current
      price charged by FES under the agreement and, as a result, Met-Ed’s and
      Penelec’s purchased power costs could materially increase. If Met-Ed and Penelec
      were to replace the FES supply at current market power prices without
      corresponding regulatory authorization to increase their generation prices
      to
      customers, each company would likely incur a significant increase in operating
      expenses and experience a material deterioration in credit quality metrics.
      Under such a scenario, each company's credit profile would no longer support
      an
      investment grade rating for its fixed income securities. Met-Ed and Penelec
      are
      in the process of preparing a comprehensive rate filing that will address a
      number of transmission, distribution and supply issues and is expected to be
      filed with the PPUC in the second quarter of 2006. That filing will include,
      among other things, a request for appropriate regulatory action to mitigate
      adverse consequences from any future reduction, in whole or in part, in the
      availability to Met-Ed and Penelec of supply under the existing FES agreement.
      There can be no assurance, however, that if FES ultimately determines to
      terminate, or significantly modify the agreement, timely regulatory relief
      will
      be granted by the PPUC or, to the extent granted, adequate to mitigate such
      adverse consequences.

On
      January 12,
      2005, Met-Ed and Penelec filed, before the PPUC, a request for deferral of
      transmission-related costs beginning January 1, 2005, estimated to be
      approximately $8 million per month. The OCA, OSBA, OTS, MEIUG, PICA,
      Allegheny Electric Cooperative and Pennsylvania Rural Electric Association
      have
      all intervened in the case. To date, no hearing schedule has been established,
      and neither company has yet implemented deferral accounting for these
      costs.

On
      October 11,
      2005, Penn filed a plan with the PPUC to secure electricity supply for its
      customers at set rates following the end of its transition period on
      December 31, 2006. Penn is recommending that the RFP process cover the
      period January 1, 2007 through May 31, 2008. Hearings were held on
      January 10, 2006 with Main Briefs filed on January 27, 2006 and Reply
      Briefs on February 3, 2006. On February 17, 2006, the ALJ issued a
      Recommended Decision to adopt Penn's RFP process with modifications. A PPUC
      vote
      is expected in April 2006. Under Pennsylvania's electric competition law, Penn
      is required to secure generation supply for customers who do not choose
      alternative suppliers for their electricity.

NJBPU
      Rate
      Matters

JCP&L
      is
      permitted to defer for future collection from customers the amounts by which
      its
      costs of supplying BGS to non-shopping customers and costs incurred under NUG
      agreements exceed amounts collected through BGS and MTC rates and market sales
      of NUG energy and capacity. As of December 31, 2005, the accumulated
      deferred cost balance totaled approximately $541 million. New Jersey law
      allows for securitization of JCP&L's deferred balance upon application by
      JCP&L and a determination by the NJBPU that the conditions of the New Jersey
      restructuring legislation are met. On February 14, 2003, JCP&L filed
      for approval to securitize the July 31, 2003 deferred balance. JCP&L is
      in discussions with the NJBPU staff as a result of the stipulated settlement
      agreements (as further discussed below) which recommended that the NJBPU issue
      an order regarding JCP&L's application. On July 20, 2005, JCP&L
      requested the NJBPU to set a procedural schedule for this matter and is awaiting
      NJBPU action. On February 1, 2006, the NJBPU selected Bear Stearns as the
      financial advisor. On December 2, 2005, JCP&L filed a request for
      recovery of $165 million of actual above-market NUG costs incurred from
      August 1, 2005 through October 31, 2005 and forecasted above-market
      NUG costs for November and December 2005. The filing also includes a request
      for
      recovery of $49 million for above-market NUG costs incurred prior to
      August 1, 2003, to the extent those costs are not recoverable through
      securitization.


The
      2003 NJBPU
      decision on JCP&L's base electric rate proceeding (the Phase I Order)
      disallowed certain regulatory assets and provided for an interim return on
      equity of 9.5% on JCP&L's rate base. The Phase I order also provided
      for a Phase II proceeding in which the NJBPU would review whether JCP&L is
      in compliance with current service reliability and quality standards and
      determine whether the expenditures and projects undertaken by JCP&L to
      increase its system's reliability are prudent and reasonable for rate recovery.
      Depending on its assessment of JCP&L's service reliability, the NJBPU could
      have increased JCP&L’s return on equity to 9.75% or decreased it to
      9.25%.

On
      July 16,
      2004, JCP&L filed the Phase II petition and testimony with the NJBPU,
      requesting an increase in base rates of $36 million for the recovery of
      system reliability costs and a 9.75% return on equity. The filing also requested
      an increase to the MTC deferred balance recovery of approximately
      $20 million annually.

On
      May 25,
      2005, the NJBPU approved two stipulated settlement agreements. The first
      stipulation between JCP&L and the NJBPU staff resolves all of the issues
      associated with JCP&L's motion for reconsideration of the Phase I
      Order. The second stipulation between JCP&L, the NJBPU staff and the
      Ratepayer Advocate resolves all of the issues associated with JCP&L's
      Phase II proceeding. The stipulated settlements provide for, among other
      things, the following:

·

                increase in distribution revenues of $23 million effective
                June 1, 2005, associated with the Phase I Order
                reconsideration;

An
                annual
                reduction in both rates and amortization expense of $8 million,
                effective June 1, 2005, in anticipation of an NJBPU order regarding
                JCP&L's request to securitize up to $277 million of its deferred
                cost balance;

·

An
                increase in
                JCP&L's authorized return on common equity from 9.5% to 9.75%;
                and

·

A
                commitment
                by JCP&L, through December 31, 2006 or until related legislation
                is adopted, whichever occurs first, to maintain a target level of
                customer
                service reliability with a reduction in JCP&L's authorized return on
                common equity from 9.75% to 9.5% if the target is not met for two
                consecutive quarters. The authorized return on common equity would
                then be
                restored to 9.75% if the target is met for two consecutive
                quarters.

The
      Phase II
      stipulation included an agreement that the distribution revenue increase also
      reflects a three-year amortization of JCP&L's one-time service reliability
      improvement costs incurred in 2003-2005. This resulted in the creation of a
      regulatory asset associated with accelerated tree trimming and other reliability
      costs which were expensed in 2003 and 2004. The establishment of the new
      regulatory asset of approximately $28 million resulted in an increase to
      net income of approximately $16 million ($0.05 per share of common stock)
      in the second quarter of 2005.

JCP&L
      sells all
      self-supplied energy (NUGs and owned generation) to the wholesale market with
      offsetting credits to its deferred energy balance with the exception of 300
      MW
      from JCP&L's NUG committed supply currently being used to serve BGS
      customers pursuant to NJBPU order for the period June 1, 2005 through
      May 31, 2006. New BGS tariffs reflecting the results of a February 2005
      auction for the BGS supply became effective June 1, 2005.

The
      NJBPU decision
      approving the BGS procurement proposal for the period beginning June 1,
      2006 was issued on October 12, 2005. JCP&L submitted a compliance
      filing on October 26, 2005, which was approved on November 10, 2005.
      The written Order was dated December 8, 2005. The auction took place in
      early February 2006 and the results have been approved by the
      NJBPU.

In
      accordance with
      an April 28, 2004 NJBPU order, JCP&L filed testimony on June 7,
      2004 supporting a continuation of the current level and duration of the funding
      of TMI-2 decommissioning costs by New Jersey customers without a reduction,
      termination or capping of the funding. On September 30, 2004, JCP&L
      filed an updated TMI-2 decommissioning study. This study resulted in an updated
      total decommissioning cost estimate of $729 million (in 2003 dollars)
      compared to the estimated $528 million (in 2003 dollars) from the prior
      1995 decommissioning study. The Ratepayer Advocate filed comments on
      February 28, 2005. On March 18, 2005, JCP&L filed a response to
      those comments. A schedule for further proceedings has not yet been
      set.

On
      August 1,
      2005, the NJBPU established a proceeding to determine whether additional
      ratepayer protections are required at the state level in light of the recent
      repeal of PUHCA under the EPACT. An NJBPU proposed rulemaking to address the
      issues was published in the NJ Register on December 19, 2005. The proposal
      would prevent a holding company that owns a gas or electric public utility
      from
      investing more than 25% of the combined assets of its utility and
      utility-related subsidiaries into businesses unrelated to the utility industry.
      A public hearing was held on February 7, 2006 and comments may be submitted
      to the NJBPU by February 17, 2006. JCP&L is not able to predict the
      outcome of this proceeding at this time.


FERC
      Rate
      Matters

On
      November 1, 2004, ATSI requested authority from the FERC to defer
      approximately $54 million of vegetation management costs estimated to be
      incurred from 2004 through 2007. On March 4, 2005, the FERC approved ATSI's
      request to defer those costs ($26 million deferred as of December 31,
      2005). ATSI expects to file an application with the FERC in 2006 that would
      include recovery of the deferred costs beginning June 1, 2006.

On
      January 24,
      2006, ATSI and MISO filed an application with the FERC to modify the Attachment
      O formula rate mechanism to permit ATSI to accelerate recovery of revenues
      lost
      due to the FERC's elimination of through and out rates between MISO and PJM,
      and
      the elimination of other ATSI rates in the MISO tariff. Revenues formerly
      collected under these rates are currently used to reduce the ATSI zonal
      transmission rate in the Attachment O formula. The revenue shortfall created
      by
      elimination of these rates would not be fully reflected in ATSI's formula rate
      until June 1, 2006, unless the proposed Revenue Credit Collection is
      approved by the FERC. The Revenue Credit Collection mechanism is designed to
      collect approximately $40 million in revenues on an annualized basis
      beginning June 1, 2006. FERC is expected to act on this filing on or before
      April 1, 2006.

ATSI,
      JCP&L,
      Met-Ed, Penelec, and FES continue to be involved in FERC hearings concerning
      the
      calculation and imposition of Seams Elimination Cost Adjustment (SECA) charges
      to various load serving entities. Pursuant to its January 30, 2006 Order,
      the FERC has compressed both phases of this proceeding into a single hearing
      scheduled to begin May 1, 2006, with an initial decision on or before
      August 11, 2006.

On
      January 31,
      2005, certain PJM transmission owners made three filings pursuant to a
      settlement agreement previously approved by the FERC. JCP&L, Met-Ed and
      Penelec were parties to that proceeding and joined in two of the filings. In
      the
      first filing, the settling transmission owners submitted a filing justifying
      continuation of their existing rate design within the PJM RTO. In the second
      filing, the settling transmission owners proposed a revised Schedule 12 to
      the PJM tariff designed to harmonize the rate treatment of new and existing
      transmission facilities. Interventions and protests were filed on
      February 22, 2005. In the third filing, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company
      and Pepco Holdings, Inc. requested a formula rate for transmission service
      provided within their respective zones. On May 31, 2005, the FERC issued an
      order on these cases. First, it set for hearing the existing rate design and
      indicated that it will issue a final order within six months. Second, the FERC
      approved the proposed Schedule 12 rate harmonization. Third, the FERC
      accepted the proposed formula rate, subject to referral and hearing procedures.
      On June 30, 2005, the PJM transmission owners filed a request for rehearing
      of the May 31, 2005 order. The rate design and formula rate proceedings are
      currently being litigated before the FERC. If FERC accepts AEP’s proposal to
      create a “postage stamp” rate for high voltage transmission facilities across
      PJM, significant additional transmission revenues would be imposed on JCP&L,
      Met-Ed, Penelec, and other transmission zones within PJM.

On
      November 1,
      2005, FES filed two power sales agreements for approval with the FERC. One
      power
      sales agreement provided for FES to provide the PLR requirements of the Ohio
      Companies at a price equal to the retail generation rates approved by the PUCO
      for a period of three years beginning January 1, 2006. The Ohio
      Companies will be relieved of their obligation to obtain PLR power
      requirements from FES if the Ohio competitive bid process results in a lower
      price for retail customers. A similar power sales agreement between FES and
      Penn
      permits Penn to obtain its PLR power requirements from FES at a fixed price
      equal to the retail generation price during 2006. Penn has filed a plan with
      the
      PPUC to use an RFP process to obtain its power supply requirements after
      2006.

On
      December 29,
      2005, the FERC issued an order setting the two power sales agreements for
      hearing. The order criticizes the Ohio competitive bid process, and requires
      FES
      to submit additional evidence in support of the reasonableness of the prices
      charged in the Ohio and Pennsylvania Contracts. A pre-hearing conference was
      held on January 18, 2006 to determine the hearing schedule in this case.
      FES expects an initial decision to be issued in this case in the fall of 2006.
      The outcome of this proceeding cannot be predicted. FES has sought rehearing
      of
      the December 29, 2005 order.

Capital
      Requirements

Capital expenditures for the Companies, FES and FirstEnergy’s other subsidiaries
      for the years 2006 through 2010 excluding nuclear fuel, are shown in the
      following table. Such costs include expenditures for the betterment of existing
      facilities and for the construction of generating capacity, facilities for
      environmental compliance, transmission lines, distribution lines, substations
      and other assets.

During
      the 2006-2010
      period, maturities of, and sinking fund requirements for, long-term debt of
      FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries are:

FirstEnergy's
      investments for additional nuclear fuel during the 2006-2010 period are
      estimated to be approximately $711 million, of which about
      $169 million applies to 2006. During the same period, its nuclear fuel
      investments are expected to be reduced by approximately $560 million and
      $92 million, respectively, as the nuclear fuel is consumed. As a result of
      the intra-system generation assets transfers, NGC is now responsible for
      FirstEnergy's nuclear fuel investments. The following table displays the
      Companies' operating lease commitments, net of capital trust cash receipts
      for
      the 2006-2010 period.

FirstEnergy
      had
      approximately $731 million of short-term indebtedness as of
      December 31, 2005, comprised of $439 million in borrowings from a
      $2 billion revolving line of credit, $280 million in borrowings
      through $550 million of available accounts receivables financing and
      $12 million of other bank borrowings. Total short-term bank lines available
      to FirstEnergy and the Companies as of December 31, 2005 were approximately
      $2.6 billion.

On
      June 14,
      2005, FirstEnergy, OE, Penn, CEI, TE, JCP&L, Met-Ed, Penelec, FES and ATSI,
      as Borrowers, entered into a syndicated $2 billion five-year revolving
      credit facility that expires in June 2010. Borrowings under the facility are
      available to each Borrower separately and mature on the earlier of 364 days
      from
      the date of borrowing or the commitment termination date, as the same may be
      extended. As of December 31, 2005, FirstEnergy was the only borrower on
      this revolver with an outstanding balance of $439 million. The annual
      facility fees are 0.15% to 0.50%.


FirstEnergy may borrow under these facilities and could transfer any of its
      borrowings to its subsidiaries. These revolving credit facilities, combined
      with
      an aggregate $550 million of accounts receivable financing facilities for
      OE, CEI, TE, Met-Ed, Penelec and Penn, are intended to provide liquidity to
      meet
      our short-term working capital requirements and those of our subsidiaries.
      Total
      unused borrowing capability under existing facilities and accounts receivable
      financing facilities totaled $1.75 billion as of December 31, 2005. An
      additional source of ongoing cash for FirstEnergy, as a holding company, is
      cash
      dividends from its subsidiaries. In 2005, the holding company received
      $1.3 billion of cash dividends on common stock from its
      subsidiaries.

Based
      on their
      present plans, the Companies could provide for their cash requirements in 2006
      from the following sources: funds to be received from operations; available
      cash
      and temporary cash investments as of December 31, 2005 (Company’s
      non-utility subsidiaries - $63 million, and OE - $1 million); the
      issuance of long-term debt (for refunding purposes); and funds available under
      revolving credit arrangements.

The
      extent and type
      of future financings will depend on the need for external funds as well as
      market conditions, the maintenance of an appropriate capital structure and
      the
      ability of the Companies to comply with coverage requirements in order to issue
      FMB and preferred stock. The Companies will continue to monitor financial market
      conditions and, where appropriate, may take advantage of economic opportunities
      to refund debt and preferred stock to the extent that their financial resources
      permit.

The
      coverage
      requirements contained in the first mortgage indentures under which the
      Companies issue FMB provide that, except for certain refunding purposes, the
      Companies may not issue FMB unless applicable net earnings (before income
      taxes), calculated as provided in the indentures, for any period of twelve
      consecutive months within the fifteen calendar months preceding the month in
      which such additional bonds are issued, are at least twice annual interest
      requirements on outstanding FMB, including those being issued. As of
      December 31, 2005, the Ohio Companies and Penn had the aggregate capability
      to issue approximately $1.2 billion of additional FMB on the basis of
      property additions and retired bonds under the terms of their respective
      mortgage indentures. The issuance of FMB by OE and CEI are also subject to
      provisions of their senior note indentures generally limiting the incurrence
      of
      additional secured debt, subject to certain exceptions that would permit, among
      other things, the issuance of secured debt (including FMB) (i) supporting
      pollution control notes or similar obligations, or (ii) as an extension, renewal
      or replacement of previously outstanding secured debt. In addition, these
      provisions would permit OE and CEI to incur additional secured debt not
      otherwise permitted by a specified exception of up to $651 million and
      $582 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. Under the
      provisions of its senior note indenture, JCP&L may issue additional FMB only
      as collateral for senior notes. As of December 31, 2005, JCP&L had the
      capability to issue $715 million of additional senior notes upon the basis
      of FMB collateral.

OE’s,
      Penn’s, TE’s
      and JCP&L’s respective articles of incorporation prohibit the sale of
      preferred stock unless applicable gross income, calculated as provided in the
      articles of incorporation, is equal to at least 1-1/2 times the aggregate of
      the
      annual interest requirements on indebtedness and annual dividend requirements
      on
      preferred stock outstanding immediately thereafter. Based upon applicable
      earnings coverage tests in their respective charters, OE, Penn, TE and JCP&L
      could issue a total of $5.5 billion of preferred stock (assuming no
      additional debt was issued) as of the end of 2005. CEI, Met-Ed and Penelec
      do
      not have similar restriction tests and could issue up to the number of preferred
      stock shares authorized under their respective charters (see Note 11(B) to
      FirstEnergy's Consolidated Financial Statements).

To
      the extent that
      coverage requirements or market conditions restrict the Companies’ abilities to
      issue desired amounts of FMB or preferred stock, the Companies may seek other
      methods of financing. Such financings could include the sale of preferred and/or
      preference stock or of such other types of securities as might be authorized
      by
      applicable regulatory authorities which would not otherwise be sold and could
      result in annual interest charges and/or dividend requirements in excess of
      those that would otherwise be incurred.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, approximately $1.0 billion was remaining under
      FirstEnergy’s shelf registration statement, filed with the SEC in 2003, to
      support future securities issues. The shelf registration provides the
      flexibility to issue and sell various types of securities, including common
      stock, debt securities, and share purchase contracts and related share purchase
      units.

Nuclear
      Regulation

On January 20, 2006, FENOC announced that it has entered into a deferred
      prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District
      of Ohio and the Environmental Crimes Section of the Environment and Natural
      Resources Division of the DOJ related to FENOC’s communications with the NRC
      during the fall of 2001 in connection with NRC Bulletin 2001-01, “

Reactor
      Pressure
      Vessel Head Degradation and Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary
      Integrity”

at the Davis-Besse
      Nuclear Power Station. Under the agreement, which expires on December 31,
      2006, the United States also acknowledged FENOC's extensive corrective actions
      at Davis-Besse, FENOC's cooperation during the investigations by the DOJ and
      the
      NRC, FENOC's pledge of continued cooperation, FENOC's acknowledgement of
      responsibility for the behavior of its employees, and its agreement to pay
      a
      monetary penalty. The DOJ will refrain from seeking an indictment or otherwise
      initiating criminal prosecution of FENOC for all conduct related to the
      Statement of Facts attached to the deferred prosecution agreement, as long
      as
      FENOC remains in compliance with the agreement. As part of the agreement, FENOC
      paid a penalty of $28 million (which is not deductible for income tax
      purposes) which reduced FirstEnergy's earnings by $0.09 per common share in
      the
      fourth quarter of 2005. As part of the deferred prosecution agreement entered
      into with the DOJ, $4.35 million of that amount will be directed to
      community service projects.


On
      April 21,
      2005, the NRC issued a NOV and proposed a $5.45 million civil penalty
      related to the degradation of the Davis-Besse reactor vessel head issue
      described above. FirstEnergy accrued $2 million for a potential fine prior
      to 2005 and accrued the remaining liability for the proposed fine during the
      first quarter of 2005. On September 14, 2005, FENOC filed its response to
      the NOV with the NRC. FENOC accepted full responsibility for the past failure
      to
      properly implement its boric acid corrosion control and corrective action
      programs. The NRC NOV indicated that the violations do not represent current
      licensee performance and that “the NRC does not anticipate taking further
      enforcement action in this matter, relative to FENOC, absent the DOJ developing
      new additional information.” FENOC paid the penalty in the third quarter of
      2005. On January 23, 2006, FENOC supplemented its response to the NRC’s NOV
      on the Davis Besse head degradation to reflect the deferred prosecution
      agreement that FENOC had reached with the DOJ

.

Effective
      July 1, 2005 the NRC oversight panel for Davis-Besse was terminated and
      Davis-Besse returned to the standard NRC reactor oversight process. At that
      time, NRC inspections were augmented to include inspections to support the
      NRC's
      Confirmatory Order dated March 8, 2004 that was issued at the time of
      startup and to address an NRC White Finding related to the performance of the
      emergency sirens. By letter dated December 8, 2005, the NRC advised FENOC
      that the White Finding had been closed.

On
      August 12,
      2004, the NRC notified FENOC that it would increase its regulatory oversight
      of
      the Perry Nuclear Power Plant as a result of problems with safety system
      equipment over the preceding two years and the licensee's failure to take prompt
      and corrective action. FENOC operates the Perry Nuclear Power Plant. In an
      April 4, 2005 public meeting discussing FENOC’s performance at Perry, the
      NRC stated that , overall the Perry Plant operated "in a manner that preserved
      public health and safety" even though it remained under heightened NRC
      oversight. The NRC indicated that additional inspections will continue and
      that
      the plant must improve performance to be removed from the Multiple/Repetitive
      Degraded Cornerstone Column of the Action Matrix. By an inspection report dated
      January 18, 2006, the NRC closed one of the white findings (related to
      emergency preparedness) which led to the multiple degraded
      cornerstones.

On
      May 26,
      2005, the NRC held a public meeting to discuss its oversight of the Perry Plant.
      While the NRC stated that the plant continued to operate safely, the NRC also
      stated that the overall performance had not substantially improved since the
      heightened inspection was initiated. The NRC reiterated this conclusion in
      its
      mid-year assessment letter dated August 30, 2005. On September 28,
      2005, the NRC sent a CAL to FENOC describing commitments that FENOC had made
      to
      improve the performance of Perry and stated that the CAL would remain open
      until
      substantial improvement was demonstrated. The CAL was anticipated as part of
      the
      NRC's Reactor Oversight Process. If performance does not improve, the NRC has
      a
      range of options under the Reactor Oversight Process, from increased oversight
      to possible impact to the plant’s operating authority. Although unable to
      predict a potential impact, its ultimate disposition could have a material
      adverse effect on FirstEnergy's or its subsidiaries' financial condition,
      results of operations and cash flows.

As of December 16, 2005, NGC, a wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy,
      acquired ownership of the nuclear generation assets transferred from OE, CEI,
      TE
      and Penn with the exception of leasehold interests of OE and TE in certain
      of
      the nuclear plants that are subject to sale and leaseback arrangements with
      non-affiliates.

Nuclear
      Insurance

The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability which can be assessed with
      respect to a nuclear power plant to $10.8 billion (assuming 104 units
      licensed to operate) for a single nuclear incident, which amount is covered
      by:
      (i) private insurance amounting to $300 million; and (ii)
      $10.5 billion provided by an industry retrospective rating plan required by
      the NRC pursuant thereto. Under such retrospective rating plan, in the event
      of
      a nuclear incident at any unit in the United States resulting in losses in
      excess of private insurance, up to $100.6 million (but not more than
      $15 million per unit per year in the event of more than one incident) must
      be contributed for each nuclear unit licensed to operate in the country by
      the
      licensees thereof to cover liabilities arising out of the incident. Based on
      its
      present nuclear ownership and leasehold interests, FirstEnergy's maximum
      potential assessment under these provisions would be $402.4 million (OE -
      $34.4 million, NGC - $349.6 million, and TE - $18.4 million) per
      incident but not more than $60.0 million (OE - $5.1 million, NGC -
      $52.1 million, and TE - $2.8 million) in any one year for each
      incident.

In
      addition to the
      public liability insurance provided pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act,
      FirstEnergy has also obtained insurance coverage in limited amounts for economic
      loss and property damage arising out of nuclear incidents. FirstEnergy is a
      member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) which provides coverage
      (NEIL I) for the extra expense of replacement power incurred due to
      prolonged accidental outages of nuclear units. Under NEIL I, FirstEnergy
      has policies, renewable yearly, corresponding to its nuclear interests, which
      provide an aggregate indemnity of up to approximately $1.730 billion (OE -
      $150 million, NGC - $1.506 billion, TE - $74 million) for
      replacement power costs incurred during an outage after an initial 20-week
      waiting period. Members of NEIL I pay annual premiums and are subject to
      assessments if losses exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer.
      FirstEnergy's present maximum aggregate assessment for incidents at any covered
      nuclear facility occurring during a policy year would be approximately
      $13.2 million (OE - $1.1 million, NGC - $11.6 million, and TE -
      $0.5 million).


FirstEnergy is insured under property damage insurance provided by NEIL to
      the
      operating company for each plant. Under these arrangements, up to
      $2.75 billion of coverage for decontamination costs, decommissioning costs,
      debris removal and repair and/or replacement of property is provided.
      FirstEnergy pays annual premiums for this coverage and is liable for
      retrospective assessments of up to approximately $66.7 million (OE -
      $7.0 million, NGC - $55.3 million, TE - $3.6 million, Met Ed -
      $0.4 million, Penelec - $0.2 million and JCP&L -
      $0.2 million) during a policy year.

FirstEnergy
      intends
      to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as described above as long as it
      is
      available. To the extent that replacement power, property damage,
      decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement costs and other such
      costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of FirstEnergy's plants exceed
      the
      policy limits of the insurance in effect with respect to that plant, to the
      extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be covered by FirstEnergy's
      insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance becomes unavailable in
      the
      future, FirstEnergy would remain at risk for such costs.

The
      NRC requires
      nuclear power plant licensees to obtain minimum property insurance coverage
      of
      $1.06 billion or the amount generally available from private sources,
      whichever is less. The proceeds of this insurance are required to be used first
      to ensure that the licensed reactor is in a safe and stable condition and can
      be
      maintained in that condition so as to prevent any significant risk to the public
      health and safety. Within 30 days of stabilization, the licensee is required
      to
      prepare and submit to the NRC a cleanup plan for approval. The plan is required
      to identify all cleanup operations necessary to decontaminate the reactor
      sufficiently to permit the resumption of operations or to commence
      decommissioning. Any property insurance proceeds not already expended to place
      the reactor in a safe and stable condition must be used first to complete those
      decontamination operations that are ordered by the NRC. FirstEnergy is unable
      to
      predict what effect these requirements may have on the availability of insurance
      proceeds.

Environmental
      Matters

Various
      federal,
      state and local authorities regulate the Companies with regard to air and water
      quality and other environmental matters. The effects of compliance on the
      Companies with regard to environmental matters could have a material adverse
      effect on FirstEnergy’s earnings and competitive position. These environmental
      regulations affect FirstEnergy’s earnings and competitive position to the extent
      that it competes with companies that are not subject to such regulations and
      therefore do not bear the risk of costs associated with compliance, or failure
      to comply, with such regulations. Overall, FirstEnergy believes it is in
      compliance with existing regulations but is unable to predict future changes
      in
      regulatory policies and what, if any, the effects of such changes would be.
      FirstEnergy estimates additional capital expenditures for environmental
      compliance of approximately $1.8 billion for 2006 through
      2010.

The
      Companies accrue
      environmental liabilities only when they conclude that it is probable that
      they
      have an obligation for such costs and can reasonably estimate the amount of
      such
      costs. Unasserted claims are reflected in the Companies’ determination of
      environmental liabilities and are accrued in the period that they are both
      probable and reasonably estimable.

On
      December 1,
      2005, FirstEnergy issued a comprehensive report to shareholders regarding air
      emissions regulations and an assessment of its future risks and mitigation
      efforts. The report is available on FirstEnergy’s web site at

www.firstenergycorp.com/environmental

.

Clean
      Air Act
      Compliance

FirstEnergy
      is
      required to meet federally approved SO


regulations.
      Violations of such regulations can result in shutdown of the generating unit
      involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to $32,500 for each day the
      unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim enforcement policy for
      SO


regulations in Ohio
      that allows for compliance based on a 30-day averaging period. The Companies
      cannot predict what action the EPA may take in the future with respect to the
      interim enforcement policy.

FirstEnergy
      believes
      it is complying with SO


reduction
      requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 by burning lower-sulfur
      fuel, generating more electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using
      emission allowances. NO

x

reductions required
      by the 1990 Amendments are being achieved through combustion controls and the
      generation of more electricity at lower-emitting plants. In September 1998,
      the
      EPA finalized regulations requiring additional NO

x

reductions from
      FirstEnergy’s facilities. The EPA’s NO

x

Transport Rule
      imposes uniform reductions of NO

x

emissions (an
      approximate 85% reduction in utility plant NO

x

emissions from
      projected 2007 emissions) across a region of nineteen states (including
      Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania) and the District of Columbia based
      on a conclusion that such NO

x

emissions are
      contributing significantly to ozone levels in the eastern United States.
      FirstEnergy believes its facilities are also complying with the NO

x

budgets established
      under State Implementation Plans through combustion controls and post-combustion
      controls, including Selective Catalytic Reduction and Selective Non-Catalytic
      Reduction systems, and/or using emission allowances.


FirstEnergy, GPU and Met-Ed, along with the current owner of the Portland
      Generation Station, Reliant, and the purchaser of Portland Station in 1999,
      Sithe Energy, all received a notification letter from New Jersey's Attorney
      General (NJAG) dated November 16, 2005 alleging Clean Air Act violations at
      the Portland Station. Specifically, the NJAG alleges that "modifications" at
      Portland Units 1 and 2 occurred between 1979 and 1995 without
      preconstruction new source review or permitting required by the CAA's prevention
      of significant deterioration (PSD) program and states that unless the Companies
      abate the alleged violations, New Jersey may commence an action seeking
      injunctive relief, penalties and mitigation of the harm caused by excess
      emissions. Although it remains liable to Sithe Energy under a 1998 purchase
      agreement for civil penalties and fines, Met-Ed did not indemnify or remain
      responsible for any permitting or other environmental representations or
      warranties which the 1998 agreement specifically provides did not survive
      closing. No liability has been accrued as of December 31,
      2005.

National
      Ambient
      Air Quality Standards

In
      July 1997, the
      EPA promulgated changes in the NAAQS for ozone and proposed a new NAAQS for
      fine
      particulate matter. On March 10, 2005, the EPA finalized the “Clean Air
      Interstate Rule” (CAIR) covering a total of 28 states (including Michigan, New
      Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania) and the District of Columbia based on proposed
      findings that air emissions from 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia
      significantly contribute to non-attainment of the NAAQS for fine particles
      and/or the “8-hour” ozone NAAQS in other states. CAIR provides each affected
      state until 2006 to develop implementing regulations to achieve additional
      reductions of NO

x

and SO


emissions in two
      phases (Phase I in 2009 for NO

x

,
      2010 for
      SO


and Phase II in
      2015 for both NO

x

and SO


).
      FirstEnergy’s
      Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania fossil-fired generation facilities will be
      subject to the caps on SO


and NO

x

emissions, whereas
      their New Jersey fossil-fired generation facilities will be subject to a cap
      on
      NO

x

emissions only.
      According to the EPA, SO


emissions will be
      reduced by 45% (from 2003 levels) by 2010 across the states covered by the
      rule,
      with reductions reaching 73% (from 2003 levels) by 2015, capping SO


emissions in
      affected states to just 2.5 million tons annually. NO

x

emissions will be
      reduced by 53% (from 2003 levels) by 2009 across the states covered by the
      rule,
      with reductions reaching 61% (from 2003 levels) by 2015, achieving a regional
      NO

x

cap of
      1.3 million tons annually. The future cost of compliance with these
      regulations may be substantial and will depend on how they are ultimately
      implemented by the states in which FirstEnergy operates affected facilities.

Mercury
      Emissions

In
      December 2000,
      the EPA announced it would proceed with the development of regulations regarding
      hazardous air pollutants from electric power plants, identifying mercury as
      the
      hazardous air pollutant of greatest concern. On March 14, 2005, the EPA
      finalized the CAMR, which provides a cap-and-trade program to reduce mercury
      emissions from coal-fired power plants in two phases. Initially, mercury
      emissions will be capped nationally at 38 tons by 2010 (as a “co-benefit” from
      implementation of SO


and NO

x

emission caps under
      the EPA’s CAIR program). Phase II of the mercury cap-and-trade program will cap
      nationwide mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants at 15 tons per year
      by
      2018. However, the final rules give states substantial discretion in developing
      rules to implement these programs. In addition, both the CAIR and the CAMR
      have
      been challenged in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
      Columbia. FirstEnergy’s future cost of compliance with these regulations may be
      substantial and will depend on how they are ultimately implemented by the states
      in which we operate affected facilities.

The
      model rules for
      both CAIR and CAMR contemplate an input-based methodology to allocate allowances
      to affected facilities. Under this approach, allowances would be allocated
      based
      on the amount of fuel consumed by the affected sources. We would prefer an
      output-based generation-neutral methodology in which allowances are allocated
      based on megawatts of power produced. Since this approach is based on output,
      new and non-emitting generating facilities, including renewables and nuclear,
      would be entitled to their proportionate share of the allowances. Consequently,
      we would be disadvantaged if these model rules were implemented because our
      substantial reliance on non-emitting (largely nuclear) generation is not
      recognized under input-based allocation.

W.
      H. Sammis
      Plant

In 1999 and 2000, the EPA issued NOV or Compliance Orders to nine utilities
      alleging violations of the Clean Air Act based on operation and maintenance
      of
      44 power plants, including the W. H. Sammis Plant, which was owned at that
      time
      by OE and Penn. In addition, the DOJ filed eight civil complaints against
      various investor-owned utilities, including a complaint against OE and Penn
      in
      the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. These cases are
      referred to as New Source Review cases. On March 18, 2005, OE and Penn
      announced that they had reached a settlement with the EPA, the DOJ and three
      states (Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York) that resolved all issues related
      to the W. H. Sammis Plant New Source Review litigation.

This
      settlement
      agreement was approved by the Court on July 11, 2005, and requires
      reductions of NO

x

and SO


emissions at the
      W. H. Sammis Plant and other coal fired plants through the installation of
      pollution control devices and provides for stipulated penalties for failure
      to
      install and operate such pollution controls in accordance with that
      agreement.

Consequently, if
      FirstEnergy fails to install such pollution control devices, for any reason,
      including, but not limited to, the failure of any third-party contractor to
      timely meet its delivery obligations for such devices, FirstEnergy could be
      exposed to penalties under the settlement agreement. Capital expenditures
      necessary to meet those requirements are currently estimated to be
      $1.5 billion (the primary portion of which is expected to be spent in the
      2008 to 2011 time period). On August 26, 2005, FGCO entered into an
      agreement with Bechtel Power Corporation (Bechtel), under which Bechtel will
      engineer, procure, and construct air quality control systems for the reduction
      of sulfur dioxide emissions. The settlement agreement also requires OE and
      Penn
      to spend up to $25 million toward environmentally beneficial projects,
      which include wind energy purchased power agreements over a 20-year term. OE
      and
      Penn agreed to pay a civil penalty of $8.5 million. Results in 2005
      included the penalties payable by OE and Penn of $7.8 million and
      $0.7 million, respectively. OE and Penn also recognized liabilities of
      $9.2 million and $0.8 million,

respectively,
      for
      probable future cash contributions toward environmentally beneficial
      projects.


Climate
      Change

In
      December 1997,
      delegates to the United Nations’ climate summit in Japan adopted an agreement,
      the Kyoto Protocol (Protocol), to address global warming by reducing the amount
      of man-made GHG emitted by developed countries by 5.2% from 1990 levels between
      2008 and 2012. The United States signed the Protocol in 1998 but it failed
      to
      receive the two-thirds vote of the United States Senate required for
      ratification. However, the Bush administration has committed the United States
      to a voluntary climate change strategy to reduce domestic GHG intensity - the
      ratio of emissions to economic output - by 18% through 2012. The EPACT
      established a Committee on Climate Change Technology to coordinate federal
      climate change activities and promote the development and deployment of GHG
      reducing technologies.

The
      Companies cannot
      currently estimate the financial impact of climate change policies, although
      the
      potential restrictions on CO


emissions could
      require significant capital and other expenditures. However, the CO


emissions per
      kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by the Companies is lower than many
      regional competitors due to its diversified generation sources, which include
      low or non-CO


emitting gas-fired
      and nuclear generators.

Clean
      Water
      Act

Various
      water
      quality regulations, the majority of which are the result of the federal Clean
      Water Act and its amendments, apply to the Companies' plants. In addition,
      Ohio,
      New Jersey and Pennsylvania have water quality standards applicable to the
      Companies' operations. As provided in the Clean Water Act, authority to grant
      federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System water discharge permits
      can be assumed by a state. Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have assumed such
      authority.

On
      September 7,
      2004, the EPA established new performance standards under Section 316(b) of
      the
      Clean Water Act for reducing impacts on fish and shellfish from cooling water
      intake structures at certain existing large electric generating plants. The
      regulations call for reductions in impingement mortality, when aquatic organisms
      are pinned against screens or other parts of a cooling water intake system
      and
      entrainment, which occurs when aquatic species are drawn into a facility’s
      cooling water system. The Companies are conducting comprehensive demonstration
      studies, due in 2008, to determine the operational measures, equipment or
      restoration activities, if any, necessary for compliance by its facilities
      with
      the performance standards. The Companies are unable to predict the outcome
      of
      such studies. Depending on the outcome of such studies, the future cost of
      compliance with these standards may require material capital
      expenditures.

Regulation
      of
      Hazardous Waste

As
      a result of the
      Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, and the Toxic
      Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state hazardous waste regulations
      have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel combustion waste products, such
      as
      coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste disposal requirements pending
      the
      EPA’s evaluation of the need for future regulation. The EPA subsequently
      determined that regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is unnecessary.
      In
      April 2000, the EPA announced that it will develop national standards regulating
      disposal of coal ash under its authority to regulate nonhazardous
      waste.

The
      Companies have
      been named as PRPs at waste disposal sites, which may require cleanup under
      the
      Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980.
      Allegations of disposal of hazardous substances at historical sites and the
      liability involved are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute; however,
      federal law provides that all PRPs for a particular site are liable on a joint
      and several basis. Therefore, environmental liabilities that are considered
      probable have been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
      December 31, 2005, based on estimates of the total costs of cleanup, the
      Companies’ proportionate responsibility for such costs and the financial ability
      of other nonaffiliated entities to pay. In addition, JCP&L has accrued
      liabilities for environmental remediation of former manufactured gas plants
      in
      New Jersey; those costs are being recovered by JCP&L through a
      non-bypassable SBC. Total liabilities of approximately $64 million have
      been accrued through December 31, 2005.

Fuel
      Supply

FirstEnergy
      currently has long-term coal contracts to provide approximately
      20.5 million tons for the year 2006. The contracts are shared among the
      Companies based on various economic considerations. This contract coal is
      produced primarily from mines located in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Wyoming, West
      Virginia and Ohio. The contracts expire at various times through
      December 31, 2021.

FirstEnergy
      estimates its 2006 coal requirements to be approximately 23.1 million tons
      to be met from the long-term contracts as well as from spot market purchases.
      See “Environmental Matters” for factors pertaining to meeting environmental
      regulations affecting coal-fired generating units.


FirstEnergy
      has
      contracts for uranium material and conversion services through 2008. The
      enrichment services are contracted for all of the enrichment requirements for
      nuclear fuel through 2006. A portion of enrichment requirements is also
      contracted through 2011. Fabrication services for fuel assemblies are contracted
      for the next two reloads for Beaver Valley Unit 1, the next two reloads for
      Beaver Valley Unit 2 (through approximately 2007 and 2006, respectively),
      the next reload for Davis-Besse (through approximately 2006) and through the
      operating license period for Perry (through approximately 2026). The Davis-Besse
      fabrication contract also has an extension provision for services through the
      current operating license period (approximately 2017). In addition to the
      existing commitments, FirstEnergy intends to make additional arrangements for
      the supply of uranium and for the subsequent conversion, enrichment,
      fabrication, and waste disposal services.

On-site
      spent fuel
      storage facilities are expected to be adequate for Perry through 2011;
      facilities at Beaver Valley Units 1 and 2 are expected to be adequate
      through 2015 and 2008, respectively. With the plant modifications completed
      in
      2002, Davis-Besse has adequate storage through the remainder of its current
      operating license period. After current on-site storage capacity is exhausted,
      additional storage capacity will have to be obtained either through plant
      modifications, interim off-site disposal, or permanent waste disposal
      facilities. The Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 provides for the
      construction of facilities for the permanent disposal of high-level nuclear
      wastes, including spent fuel from nuclear power plants operated by electric
      utilities. CEI, TE, OE and Penn have contracts with the U.S. Department of
      Energy (DOE) for the disposal of spent fuel for Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse
      and
      Perry. On February 15, 2002, President Bush approved the DOE’s
      recommendation of Yucca Mountain for underground disposal of spent nuclear
      fuel
      from nuclear power plants and high level waste from U.S. defense programs.
      The
      approval by President Bush enables the process to proceed to the licensing
      phase. Based on the DOE schedule published in the July 1999 Draft Environmental
      Impact Statement, the Yucca Mountain Repository is currently projected to start
      receiving spent fuel in 2010. The Repository is expected to be delayed further
      as the result of an announced delay in submission of the license application.
      The Companies intend to make additional arrangements for storage capacity as
      a
      contingency for further delays with the DOE acceptance of spent fuel for
      disposal past 2010.

System
      Capacity and Reserves

The
      2005 net maximum
      hourly demand for each of the Companies was: OE-6,303 MW (including an
      additional 387 MW of firm power sales under a contract which ended
      December 31, 2005) on July 25, 2005; Penn-1,106 MW (including an
      additional 47 MW of firm power sales under a contract which ended
      December 31, 2005) on July 26, 2005; CEI-4,522 MW on July 25,
      2005; TE-2,138 MW on July 25, 2005; JCP&L-6,279 MW on July 27,
      2005; Met-Ed-2,850 MW on August 4, 2005; and Penelec-2,875 MW on
      August 4, 2005. JCP&L’s load is supplied through the New Jersey BGS
      Auction process, transferring the full 6,135 MW load obligation to other
      parties. FES participated in the auction and is currently responsible for a
      MW segment of that load through May 2006.

Based
      on existing
      capacity plans, ongoing arrangements for firm purchase contracts, and
      anticipated term power sales and purchases, FirstEnergy has sufficient supply
      resources to meet load obligations. The current FirstEnergy capacity portfolio
      contains 13,427 MW of owned generation, 480 MW of generation from our 20.5%
      ownership of OVEC, and approximately 1,600 MW of long-term purchases from NUGs.
      FirstEnergy has also entered into approximately 275 MW of long-term purchase
      contracts for renewable energy from wind resources. Any remaining load
      obligations will be met through a mix of multi-year forward purchases,
      short-term forward purchases (less than one year) and spot market purchases.
      FirstEnergy's sources of generation during 2005 were 64% and 36% from coal
      and
      nuclear, respectively.

Regional
      Reliability

The
      Ohio Companies
      and Penn participate with 24 other electric companies operating in nine states
      in ECAR, which was organized for the purpose of furthering the reliability
      of
      bulk power supply in the area through coordination of the planning and operation
      by the ECAR members of their bulk power supply facilities. The ECAR members
      have
      established principles and procedures regarding matters affecting the
      reliability of the bulk power supply within the ECAR region. Procedures have
      been adopted regarding: i) the evaluation and simulated testing of systems’
performance; ii) the establishment of minimum levels of daily operating
      reserves; iii) the development of a program regarding emergency procedures
      during conditions of declining system frequency; and iv) the basis for
      uniform rating of generating equipment.

The ECAR, Mid-Atlantic Area Council, and Mid-American Interconnected Network
      reliability councils have completed the consolidation of these regions into
      a
      single new regional reliability organization known as ReliabilityFirst
      Corporation. ReliabilityFirst began operations as a regional reliability council
      under NERC on January 1, 2006 and intends to file and obtain certification
      consistent with the final rule as a “regional entity” under the ERO during 2006.
      All of FirstEnergy’s facilities are located within the ReliabilityFirst
      region.

The
      transmission
      facilities of JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec are operated by PJM. PJM is the
      organization responsible for the operation and control of the bulk electric
      power system throughout major portions of five Mid-Atlantic states and the
      District of Columbia. PJM is dedicated to meeting the reliability criteria
      and
      standards of NERC and the Mid-Atlantic Area Council.


Competition

The
      Companies
      compete with other utilities for intersystem bulk power sales and for sales
      to
      municipalities and cooperatives. The Companies also compete with suppliers
      of
      natural gas and other forms of energy in connection with their industrial and
      commercial sales and in the home climate control market, both with respect
      to
      new customers and conversions, and with all other suppliers of electricity.
      To
      date, there has been no substantial cogeneration by the Companies’
customers.

As
      a result of
      actions taken by state legislative bodies over the last few years, major changes
      in the electric utility business are occurring in parts of the United States,
      including Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania where FirstEnergy’s utility
      subsidiaries operate. These changes have resulted in fundamental alterations
      in
      the way traditional integrated utilities and holding company systems, like
      FirstEnergy, conduct their business. In accordance with the Ohio electric
      utility restructuring law under which Ohio electric customers could begin
      choosing their electric generation suppliers starting in January 2001,
      FirstEnergy has further aligned its business units to accommodate its retail
      strategy and participate in the competitive electricity marketplace in Ohio.
      The
      organizational changes deal with the unbundling of electric utility services
      and
      new ways of conducting business. FirstEnergy’s Power Supply Management Services
      segment participates in deregulated energy markets in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New
      Jersey and Michigan.

Competition
      in
      Ohio’s electric generation began on January 1, 2001. Pursuant to the
      generation asset transfers on October 24, 2005 and December 16, 2005, FGCO
      and
      NGC now own nearly all of the fossil and nuclear generation assets,
      respectively, previously owned by the Companies. The Companies continue to
      provide generation services to regulated franchise customers who have not chosen
      an alternative, competitive generation supplier, except in New Jersey where
      JCP&L’s obligation to provide BGS has been removed through a transitional
      mechanism of auctioning the obligation (see “NJBPU Rate Matters”). In September
      2002, Met-Ed and Penelec assigned their PLR responsibility to FES through a
      wholesale power sale agreement. Under the terms of the wholesale agreement,
      FES
      assumed the supply obligation and the supply profit and loss risk for the
      portion of power supply requirements not self-supplied by Met-Ed and Penelec
      (see “PPUC Rate Matters” for further discussion). The Ohio Companies and Penn
      obtain their generation through power supply agreements with FES.

Research
      and
      Development

The
      Companies
      participate in funding the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), which
      was
      formed for the purpose of expanding electric research and development under
      the
      voluntary sponsorship of the nation’s electric utility
      industry - public, private and cooperative. Its goal is to mutually
      benefit utilities and their customers by promoting the development of new and
      improved technologies to help the utility industry meet present and future
      electric energy needs in environmentally and economically acceptable ways.
      EPRI
      conducts research on all aspects of electric power production and use, including
      fuels, generation, delivery, energy management and conservation, environmental
      effects and energy analysis. The major portion of EPRI research and development
      projects is directed toward practical solutions and their applications to
      problems currently facing the electric utility industry.

Employees

As
      of
      January 1, 2006, FirstEnergy’s nonutility subsidiaries and the Companies
      had a total of 14,586 employees (excluding MYR) located in the United States

      employees, 7,027 (including 229 for FESC, 740 for OE, 667 for CEI, 328 for
      TE,
      148 for Penn, 1,120 for JCP&L, 508 for Met-Ed, 612 for Penelec, 1,161 for
      FES, 934 for FENOC and 580 for FSG) are covered by collective bargaining
      agreements.

JCP&L's bargaining unit employees filed a grievance challenging JCP&L's
      2002 call-out procedure that required bargaining unit employees to respond
      to
      emergency power outages. On May 20, 2004, an arbitration panel concluded
      that the call-out procedure violated the parties' collective bargaining
      agreement. At the conclusion of the June 1, 2005 hearing, the Arbitrator
      decided not to hear testimony on damages and closed the proceedings. On
      September 9, 2005, the Arbitrator issued an opinion to award approximately
      $16 million to the bargaining unit employees. On February 6, 2006, the
      federal court granted a union motion to dismiss JCP&L's appeal as premature.
      JCP&L will file its appeal again in federal district court once the damages
      associated with this case are identified at an individual employee level.
      JCP&L recognized a liability for the potential $16 million award in
      2005.

ITEM
      1A.
      RISK FACTORS

Risks
      Arising
      from the Reliability of Our Power Plants and Transmission and Distribution
      Equipment

Operation
      of
      generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves risk, including
      potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, labor
      disputes, stray voltage and performance below expected levels. In addition,
      weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation,
      transmission and distribution delivery systems. Because our transmission
      facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of
      those facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable
      events occurring on the systems of such third parties.

Operation
      of our
      power plants below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues or
      increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages may
      require us to incur significant replacement power costs. Moreover, if we were
      unable to perform under contractual obligations, penalties or liability for
      damages could result. OE, CEI, and TE are exposed to losses under their
      applicable sale-leaseback agreements for certain generating facilities upon
      the
      occurrence of certain contingent events that could render these facilities
      worthless. Although we believe these types of events are unlikely to occur,
      OE,
      CEI and TE each have a maximum exposure to loss under these provisions of
      approximately $1 billion.

We
      remain obligated
      to provide safe and reliable service to customers within our franchised service
      territories. Meeting this commitment requires the expenditure of significant
      capital and other resources. Failure to provide safe and reliable service and
      failure to meet regulatory reliability standards due to a number of factors,
      including equipment failure and weather, could adversely affect our operating
      results through reduced revenues and increased capital and maintenance costs
      and
      the imposition of penalties/fines or other adverse regulatory
      outcomes.


Changes
      in
      Commodity Prices Could Adversely Affect Our Profit Margins

While
      much of our
      generation currently serves customers under retail rates set by regulatory
      bodies, we also purchase and sell electricity in the competitive wholesale
      and
      retail markets. Increases in the costs of fuel for our generation facilities
      (particularly coal and natural gas) can affect our profit margins in both
      competitive and non-competitive markets. Changes in the market prices of
      electricity, which are affected by changes in other commodity costs and other
      factors, may impact our results of operations and financial position by
      increasing the amount we pay to purchase power to supply PLR obligations in
      Ohio
      and Pennsylvania.

Electricity
      and fuel
      prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time for
      a
      variety of reasons, including:

·

changing
                weather conditions or seasonality;

·

changes
                in
                electricity usage by our customers;

·

illiquidity
                in
                wholesale power and other markets;

·

transmission
                congestion or transportation constraints, inoperability or
                inefficiencies;

·

availability
                of competitively priced alternative energy
                sources;

·

changes
                in
                supply and demand for energy
                commodities;

·

changes
                in
                power production capacity;

·

outages
                at our
                power production facilities or those of our
                competitors;

·

changes
                in
                production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal, crude
                oil and
                refined products; and

·

natural
                disasters, wars, acts of sabotage, terrorist acts, embargoes and
                other
                catastrophic events.

Nuclear
      Generation Involves Risks that Include Uncertainties Relating to Health and
      Safety, Additional Capital Costs, the Adequacy of Insurance Coverage and Nuclear
      Plant Decommissioning

FirstEnergy is subject to the risks of nuclear generation, including but not
      limited to the following:

·

the
                potential
                harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from
                the
                operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal
                of
                radioactive materials;

·

limitations
                on
                the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover
                losses
                that might arise in connection with our nuclear operations or those
                of
                others in the United States;

·

uncertainties
                with respect to contingencies and assessments if insurance coverage
                is
                inadequate; and

·

uncertainties
                with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning
                nuclear plants at the end of their licensed
                operation.

The
      NRC has broad
      authority under federal law to impose licensing security and safety-related
      requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event
      of
      non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down
      a
      unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until
      compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC
      could
      necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants, including ours.

FirstEnergy’s
      nuclear facilities are insured under NEIL policies issued for each plant. Under
      these policies, up to $2.75 billion of insurance coverage is provided for
      property damage and decontamination and decommissioning costs. We have also
      obtained approximately $1.7 billion of insurance coverage for replacement power
      costs. Under these policies, we can be assessed a maximum of approximately
      $80
      million for incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring during a policy
      year that are in excess of accumulated funds available to the insurer for paying
      losses.


Regulatory
      Changes in the Electric Industry Could Affect Our Competitive Position and
      Result in Unrecoverable Costs Adversely Affecting Our Business and Results
      of
      Operations

As
      a result of the
      actions taken by state legislative bodies over the last few years, changes
      in
      the electric utility business have occurred and are continuing to take place
      in
      states throughout the United States, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and New
      Jersey. These changes have resulted, and are expected to continue to result,
      in
      fundamental alterations in the way integrated utilities conduct their
      business.

Increased
      competition resulting from restructuring efforts, including but not limited
      to,
      the implementation by regulators of periodic competitive bid processes for
      generation supply, could have an adverse financial impact on us and consequently
      on our results of operations. Increased competition could result in additional
      pressure to lower prices, including the price of electricity, potentially
      resulting in impairment of assets, loss of retail customers, lower profit
      margins and increased costs of capital. We cannot predict the extent or timing
      of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets.

The
      FERC and the
      U.S. Congress propose changes from time to time in the structure and conduct
      of
      the electric utility industry. If the restructuring and deregulation efforts
      result in increased competition or unrecoverable costs, our business and results
      of operations may be adversely affected. We cannot predict the extent or timing
      of further efforts to restructure, deregulate or re-regulate our business or
      the
      industry.

We
      Are Exposed
      to Operational, Price and Credit Risks Associated With Selling and Marketing
      Products in the Power Markets That We Do Not Always Completely Hedge
      Against

We
      purchase and sell
      power at the wholesale level under market-based tariffs authorized by the FERC,
      and also enter into short-term agreements to sell available energy and capacity
      from our generation assets. If we are unable to deliver firm capacity and energy
      under these agreements, we would be required to pay damages. These damages
      would
      generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire
      replacement capacity or energy and the contract price of the undelivered
      capacity or energy. Depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy
      markets, such damages could be significant

.

Extreme
      weather
      conditions, unplanned power plant outages, transmission disruptions, and other
      factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause increases
      in
      the market price of replacement capacity and energy.

We
      attempt to
      mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual power sales
      arrangements by reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity to satisfy
      our net firm sales contracts and, when necessary, by purchasing firm
      transmission service. We also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel
      and
      power purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements
      and other energy-related commodities. We may not, however, hedge the entire
      exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. To the extent we
      do
      not hedge against commodity price volatility, our results of operations and
      financial position could be negatively affected.

Complex
      and
      Changing Government Regulations Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Results
      of
      Operations

We
      are subject to
      comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies
      that significantly influence our operating environment. Changes in or
      reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations or the imposition of new
      laws
      or regulations could require us to incur additional costs or change the way
      we
      conduct our business, and therefore could have an adverse impact on our results
      of operations.

On
      August 8, 2005
      President Bush signed into law the EPACT. This federal legislation will affect
      various aspects of electric generation, transmission and distribution. One
      of
      the provisions of the new legislation gives the FERC the authority to certify
      an
      ERO that will establish and enforce mandatory bulk power reliability standards,
      subject to FERC review and approval. The EPACT repealed PUHCA effective February
      8, 2006. Some of PUHCA’s consumer protection authority have been transferred to
      the FERC and state utility commissions. The repeal of PUHCA and the impact
      of
      this legislation and its implementation on both a federal and state level could
      have a significant impact on our operations.

Costs
      of
      Compliance with Environmental Laws are Significant, and the Cost of Compliance
      with Future Environmental Laws Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow and
      Profitability

Certain
      of our
      subsidiaries’ operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local
      environmental statutes, rules and regulations. Compliance with these legal
      requirements requires us to incur costs toward environmental monitoring,
      installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, maintenance,
      upgrading, remediation and permitting at all of our facilities. These
      expenditures have been significant in the past and may increase in the future.
      If the cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations
      does
      increase, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations,
      financial position and cash flows. Moreover, changes in environmental laws
      or
      regulations may materially increase our costs of compliance or accelerate the
      timing of capital expenditures. Because of the deregulation of generation,
      we
      may not directly recover through rates additional costs incurred for such
      compliance. Our compliance strategy, although reasonably based on available
      information, may not successfully address future relevant standards and
      interpretations. If FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries fail to comply with
      environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond our control
      or new interpretations of longstanding requirements, that failure could result
      in the assessment of civil or criminal liability and fines.


There
      have been
      recent changes in the EPA’s final CAIR, CAMR and CAVR. As a result of those
      changes the states have been given substantial discretion in developing their
      own rules to implement these programs. In addition, both the CAIR and the CAMR
      have been challenged in the United States Court of Appeals for the District
      of
      Columbia. As a result, the ultimate requirements of these rules may not be
      known
      for several years and may depart significantly from the current rules. If the
      final rules are remanded by the Court, if states elect not to participate in
      the
      various federal programs under the rules, or if the states elect to impose
      additional requirements on individual units that are already subject to the
      CAIR, the CAMR and/or the CAVR, our costs of compliance could increase
      significantly and could have an adverse effect on future results of operations,
      cash flows and financial condition.

Alternatively,
      if
      the final rules are remanded by the Court and their implementation is postponed,
      we could be competitively disadvantaged because we are currently obligated
      to
      comply with essentially this same level of emission controls as a result of
      our
      settlement of the New Source Review Litigation related to our W. H. Sammis
      Plant.

There
      Are
      Uncertainties Relating to Our Participation in the PJM and MISO Regional
      Transmission Organizations

Market
      rules that
      govern the operation of RTOs could affect our ability to sell power produced
      by
      our generating facilities to users in certain markets due to transmission
      constraints and attendant congestion costs. The prices in day-ahead and
      real-time RTO markets have been subject to price volatility. Administrative
      costs imposed by RTOs, including the cost of administering energy markets,
      have
      also increased. The rules governing the various regional power markets may
      also
      change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues. We are
      incurring significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in
      an
      RTO, and may be limited by state retail rate caps with respect to the price
      at
      which power can be sold to retail customers. While RTO rates for transmission
      service are designed to be revenue-neutral, our revenues from customers to
      whom
      we currently provide transmission services may not reflect all of the
      administrative and market-related costs imposed under the RTO tariff due to
      state retail rate caps. In addition, we may be required to expand our
      transmission system according to decisions made by an RTO rather than our
      internal planning process. Because it remains unclear which companies will
      be
      participating in the various regional power markets, or how RTOs will ultimately
      develop and operate or what region they will cover, and whether state regulatory
      commissions will permit full and timely recovery of RTO or market-imposed costs,
      we cannot fully assess the impact that these power markets or other ongoing
      RTO
      developments may have on us.

Weather
      Conditions such as Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Ice Storms and Droughts, as Well
      as
      Seasonal Temperature Variations Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Results
      of
      Operations

Weather
      conditions
      directly influence the demand for electric power. In our service areas, demand
      for power peaks during the summer months, with market prices also typically
      peaking at that time. As a result, overall operating results may fluctuate
      on a
      seasonal and quarterly basis. In addition, we have historically sold less power,
      and consequently received less revenue, when weather conditions are milder.
      Severe weather, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, storms, ice, droughts or other
      natural disasters, may cause outages and property damage that may require us
      to
      incur additional costs that are generally not insured and that may not be
      recoverable from customers. The effect of the failure of our facilities to
      operate as planned under these conditions would be particularly burdensome
      during a peak demand period.

We
      Are Subject
      to Financial Performance Risks Related to the Economic Cycles of the Electric
      Utility Industry

Our
      business follows
      the economic cycles of our customers. Sustained downturns or sluggishness in
      the
      economy generally affects the markets in which we operate and negatively
      influences our energy operations. Declines in demand for electricity as a result
      of economic downturns will reduce overall electricity sales and lessen our
      cash
      flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production, resulting in less
      consumption of electricity. Economic conditions also impact the rate of
      delinquent customer accounts receivable.

The
      Continuing
      Availability and Operation of Generating Units is Dependent on Retaining the
      Necessary Licenses, Permits, and Operating Authority from Governmental Entities,
      Including the NRC

We
      are required to
      have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the agencies that
      regulate our business. We believe the necessary permits, approvals and
      certificates have been obtained for our existing operations and that our
      business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, we are unable
      to predict the impact on operating results from future regulatory activities
      of
      any of these agencies.

We
      Face Certain
      Human Resource Risks Associated with the Availability of Trained and Qualified
      Labor to Meet Our Future Staffing Requirements

Workforce
      demographic issues challenge employers nationwide and are of particular concern
      to the electric utility industry. The median age of utility workers is
      significantly higher than the national average. Today, nearly one-half of the
      industry’s workforce is age 45 or higher. Consequently, we face the difficult
      challenge of finding ways to retain our aging skilled workforce while recruiting
      new talent to mitigate losses in critical knowledge and skills due to
      retirements. Mitigating these risks could require additional financial
      commitments.


Our
      Risk
      Management Policies Relating to Energy and Fuel Prices, and Counterparty Credit
      are by Their Very Nature Risk Related, and We Could Suffer Economic Losses
      Despite Such Policies

We
      attempt to manage
      the market risk inherent in our energy and fuel and debt positions. We have
      implemented procedures to enhance and monitor compliance with our risk
      management policies, including validation of transaction and market prices,
      verification of risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analysis and daily
      portfolio reporting of various risk measurement metrics. Nonetheless, we cannot
      economically hedge against all of our exposures in these areas and our risk
      management program may not operate as planned. For instance, our power plants
      might not produce the expected amount of power during a given day or time period
      due to weather conditions, technical problems or other unanticipated events,
      which could require us to make energy purchases at higher prices than the prices
      under our energy supply contracts. In addition, the amount of fuel required
      for
      our power plants during a given day or time period could be more than expected,
      which could require us to buy additional fuel at prices less favorable than
      the
      prices under our fuel contracts.

We
      also face credit
      risks that parties with whom we contract could default in their performance,
      in
      which cases we could be forced to sell our power into a lower-priced market
      or
      make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the time of contract.
      Although we have established risk management policies and programs, including
      credit policies to evaluate counterparty credit risk, there can be no assurance
      that we will be able to fully meet our obligations, that we will not be required
      to pay damages for failure to perform or that we will not experience
      counterparty non-performance or that we will collect for voided contracts.
      If
      counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter
      into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at
      then-current market prices. In that event, our financial results would likely
      be
      adversely affected.

Interest
      Rates
      and/or a Credit Ratings Downgrade Could Negatively Affect Our Financing Costs
      and Our Ability to Access Capital

We
      have near-term
      exposure to interest rates from outstanding indebtedness indexed to variable
      interest rates, and we have exposure to future interest rates as we plan to
      raise debt in the capital markets to meet maturing debt obligations and fund
      construction or other investment opportunities. Interest rates could change
      in
      significant ways as a result of economic or other events that our risk
      management processes were not established to address. As a result, we cannot
      always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us
      if
      actual events lead to greater losses or costs than our risk management positions
      were intended to hedge. Although we employ risk management techniques to hedge
      against interest rate volatility, significant and sustained increases in market
      interest rates could materially increase our financing costs and negatively
      impact our reported results.

We
      rely on access to
      bank and capital markets as sources of liquidity for cash requirements not
      satisfied by cash flows from operations. A downgrade in our credit ratings
      from
      the nationally-recognized credit rating agencies, particularly to a level below
      investment grade, could negatively affect our ability to access the bank and
      capital markets, especially in a time of uncertainty in either of those markets,
      and may require us to post cash collateral to support outstanding commodity
      positions in the wholesale market, as well as in place of letters of credit
      and
      other guarantees. A ratings downgrade would also increase the fees we pay on
      our
      various credit facilities, thus increasing the cost of our working capital.
      A
      ratings downgrade could also impact our ability to grow our businesses by
      substantially increasing the cost of, or limiting access to, capital. Our senior
      unsecured debt ratings from S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch are investment grade.
      The current ratings outlook from S&P is stable and the ratings outlook from
      Moody’s and Fitch is positive.

We
      Must Rely on
      Cash From Our Subsidiaries

We
      are a holding
      company and our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.
      Substantially all of our business is conducted by our subsidiaries.
      Consequently, our cash needs are dependent on the operating cash flows of our
      subsidiaries and their ability to upstream cash to the holding company. Our
      utility subsidiaries are regulated by various state utility commissions that
      generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of utility customers
      are
      being met. Those state commissions could attempt to impose restrictions on
      the
      ability of our utility subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise restrict
      cash
      payments to us.

We
      May
      Ultimately Incur Liability in Connection with Federal
      Proceedings

On
      December 10,
      2004, FirstEnergy received a letter from the United States Attorney’s Office
      stating that FENOC is a target of the federal grand jury investigation into
      alleged false statements made to the NRC in the Fall of 2001 in response to
      NRC
      Bulletin 2001-01. On January 20, 2006, FENOC announced that it had entered
      into
      a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
      Northern District of Ohio and the Environmental Crimes Section of the
      Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Department of Justice
      (collectively, the “Department”) related to certain statements made by FENOC
      employees to the NRC during the period September 3, 2001 through
      November 28, 2001 with respect to the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station.
      Under the Agreement, FENOC paid a penalty of $28 million and agreed to cooperate
      with the United States and NRC during the term of the Agreement (which runs
      through December 31, 2006) in all criminal and administrative investigations
      and
      proceedings related to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts attached
      to the Agreement.


In
      consideration for
      FENOC’s (i) $28 million payment, (ii) cooperation as described above, (iii)
      acceptance and acknowledgement of responsibility for its conduct as described
      in
      the Statement of Facts attached to the Agreement, (iv) compliance with federal
      criminal laws, and (v) continued compliance with the terms of the Agreement,
      the
      Department has agreed to refrain from seeking an indictment or otherwise
      initiating criminal prosecution of FENOC for the conduct described in the
      Statement of Facts attached to the Agreement. If the Department determined
      that
      FENOC failed to comply with the terms of the Agreement, it could seek an
      indictment or begin criminal proceedings against FENOC, which could have an
      adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

On
      October 20,
      2004, FirstEnergy was notified by the SEC that the previously disclosed informal
      inquiry initiated by the SEC’s Division of Enforcement in September 2003
      relating to the restatements in August 2003 of previously reported results
      by
      FirstEnergy and the Ohio Companies, and the Davis-Besse extended outage, have
      become the subject of a formal order of investigation. The SEC’s formal order of
      investigation also encompasses issues raised during the SEC’s examination of
      FirstEnergy and the Companies under the PUHCA. Concurrent with this
      notification, FirstEnergy received a subpoena asking for background documents
      and documents related to the restatements and Davis-Besse issues. On December
      30, 2004, FirstEnergy received a subpoena asking for documents relating to
      issues raised during the SEC’s PUHCA examination. On August 24, 2005,
      additional information was requested regarding Davis-Besse. FirstEnergy has
      cooperated fully with the informal inquiry and will continue to do so with
      the
      formal investigation.

Acts
      of War or
      Terrorism Could Negatively Impact Our Business

The
      possibility that
      our infrastructure, or that of an interconnected company, such as electric
      generation, transmission and distribution facilities could be direct targets
      of,
      or indirect casualties of, an act of war could affect our operations. Our
      generation plants, transmission and distribution facilities, or those of
      interconnected companies, may be targets of terrorist activities that could
      result in disruption of our ability to generate, purchase, transmit or
      distribute electricity. Any such disruption could result in a decrease in
      revenues and additional costs to purchase electricity and to replace or repair
      our assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of
      operations and financial condition.

      PROPERTIES

The
      Companies’
respective first mortgage indentures constitute, in the opinion of the
      Companies’ counsel, direct first liens on substantially all of the respective
      Companies’ physical property, subject only to excepted encumbrances, as defined
      in the indentures. See the “Leases” and “Capitalization” notes to the respective
      financial statements for information concerning leases and financing
      encumbrances affecting certain of the Companies’ properties.

FirstEnergy
      owns,
      and/or leases, the following generating units in service as of March 1, 2006,
      shown in the table below. Except for the leasehold interests referenced in
      the
      footnotes to the table, substantially all of the generating units are owned
      by
      NGC (nuclear) and FGCO (non-nuclear). See "Generation Asset Transfers" under
      Item 1 above.


Prolonged
      outages of
      existing generating units might make it necessary for FirstEnergy, depending
      upon the demand for electric service upon their system, to use to a greater
      extent than otherwise, less efficient and less economic generating units, or
      purchased power, and in some cases may require the reduction of load during
      peak
      periods under FirstEnergy interruptible programs, all to an extent not presently
      determinable.

FirstEnergy's
      generating plants and load centers are connected by a transmission system
      consisting of elements having various voltage ratings ranging from 23 kV to
      500 kV. The Companies’ overhead and underground transmission lines
      aggregate 14,980 pole miles.


The
      Companies’
electric distribution systems include 115,641 miles of overhead pole line
      and underground conduit carrying primary, secondary and street lighting
      circuits. They own substations with a total installed transformer capacity
      of
      91,323,000 kilovolt-amperes.

The
      transmission
      facilities that are owned and operated by ATSI also interconnect with those
      of
      AEP, DPL, Duquesne, Allegheny, Met-Ed and Penelec. The transmission facilities
      of JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec are physically interconnected and are operated
      on an integrated basis as part of the PJM RTO.

        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

-
        FIRSTENERGY

Evaluation
        of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

FirstEnergy's
        Chief
        Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated
        such
        registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in the Securities
        Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of the end date covered
        by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and
        Chief Financial Officer concluded that FirstEnergy's disclosure controls
        and
        procedures were effective as of December 31, 2005.

Management’s
        Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management
        is
        responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
        financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange
        Act
        of 1934. Using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
        Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated
        Framework, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
        FirstEnergy's internal control over financial reporting under the supervision
        of
        FirstEnergy's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based
        on that
        evaluation, management concluded that FirstEnergy's internal control over
        financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005. Management’s
        assessment of the effectiveness of FirstEnergy's internal control over financial
        reporting, as of December 31, 2005, has been audited by
        PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
        as
        stated in their report included in FirstEnergy's 2005 Annual Report to
        Stockholders and incorporated by reference hereto.

Changes
        in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
        were no
        changes in FirstEnergy's internal control over financial reporting during
        the
        fourth quarter of 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
        to materially affect, FirstEnergy's internal control over financial
        reporting.

Evaluation
        of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Each
        registrant's
        Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated
        such registrant's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in the
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of the
        end
        date covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the respective Chief
        Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that such registrant's
        disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,

        JCP&L

Evaluation
        of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The
        registrant's
        Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated
        such registrant's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in the
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of the
        end
        date covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive
        Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that such registrant's disclosure
        controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
        2005.

Management’s
        Consideration of the Restatement

In
        coming to the
        conclusion that the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were
        effective as of December 31, 2005, management considered, among other
        things, the restatement related to the tax matter as disclosed in Note 2
        to the
        accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
        Management reviewed and analyzed the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff
        Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 99, “Materiality,” paragraph 29 of Accounting
        Principles Board Opinion No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting,” and SAB Topic
        5F, “Accounting Changes Not Retroactively Applied Due to Immateriality.” Taking
        into consideration (i) that the restatement adjustments did not have a material
        impact on the financial statements of prior interim or annual periods taken
        as a
        whole; (ii) that the cumulative impact of the restatement adjustments on
        common
        stockholder’s equity was not material to the financial statements of prior
        interim or annual periods; and (iii) that JCP&L decided to restate its
        previously issued financial statements solely because the cumulative impact
        of
        the adjustments, if recorded in the current period, would have been material
        to
        the current year’s reported net income, management concluded that these matters
        individually did not constitute a material weakness.

Changes
        in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
        were no
        changes in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting during the
        fourth quarter of 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
        to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial
        reporting.

-
        MET-ED AND
        PENELEC

Evaluation
        of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Each
        registrant's
        Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated
        such registrant's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in the
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of the
        end
        date covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the respective Chief
        Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that such registrant's
        disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2005
        due
        to the existence of a material weakness discussed below.

A
        material weakness
        is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results
        in
        more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual
        or
        interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
        Management identified a material weakness due to deficiencies in the operating
        effectiveness of internal controls associated with the accuracy of the
        regulatory accounting for the registrants' NUG contracts. Established accounting
        procedures were misapplied with respect to Penelec's NUG contract asset,
        resulting in an inappropriate reduction to deferred NUG costs recoverable
        through Penelec's CTC and a corresponding understatement of net income. The
        affected Penelec accounts were properly adjusted as of December 31, 2005.
        While
        Met-Ed’s NUG contract position is currently a liability, the material weakness
        also extends to Met-Ed because the same controls related to the accuracy
        of the
        regulatory accounting for NUG contracts also existed for Met-Ed. As a material
        weakness as described above, this control deficiency could result in a
        misstatement of the aforementioned accounts that could result in a material
        misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that
        would not be prevented or detected.

Management
        is
        strengthening the effectiveness of internal controls related to regulatory
        accounting, related to the registrants' NUG contract accounting. Coordination
        of
        activities regarding NUG contracts between regulatory affairs and accounting
        personnel are being enhanced and a more robust review and approval process
        involving higher-level management is being established. The registrants plan
        to
        fully implement the enhancements in the first quarter of 2006.


This
        material
        weakness was discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
        and
        PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the registrants' independent registered public
        accountants.

Changes
        in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
        were no
        changes in the registrants' internal control over financial reporting during
        the
        fourth quarter of 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
        to materially affect, the registrants' internal control over financial
        reporting.

ITEM
      9B.

OTHER
      INFORMATION

On
      February 21,
      2006, the Board of Directors approved the recommendation of the Compensation
      Committee establishing FirstEnergy’s confidential performance and business
      criteria or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the 2006 performance period.
      These KPIs are related to various operational and corporate
      objectives.

Mr.
      Alexander’s KPIs
      are based on the achievement of certain levels of earnings per share, free
      cash
      flow from operations, customer service excellence, and employee, nuclear and
      other operational safety measures.

The
      KPIs established
      for Messrs. Clark and Marsh and Ms. Vespoli are based on the achievement of
      certain levels of earnings per share, free cash flow from operations, employee
      safety, corporate operating measures and contributions to earnings from various
      strategic initiatives.

The
      KPIs established
      for Mr. Grigg are based on the achievement of certain levels of earnings per
      share, free cash flow from operations, employee safety, corporate operating
      measures, reliability and generation fleet performance
      and margin.

On February 21, 2006, FirstEnergy’s Board of Directors approved the award of
      performance-adjusted restricted stock units (“RSUs’) to the named executive
      officers (the “Grantees”) under the FirstEnergy Executive and Director Incentive
      Compensation Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan is applicable to, among others, the
      company’s senior executive officers including the Grantees. The
      performance-adjusted restricted stock units are subject to a Restricted Stock
      Unit Agreement (the “Agreement”) dated March 1, 2006. Under the terms and
      conditions of the Agreement, the company granted a pre-determined number of
      RSUs
      that are subject to adjustment based on the company’s performance as described
      below.

The RSUs vest at the end of three years. Dividends accrue on the RSUs during
        the
        vesting period and are converted into additional units. The Grantee is credited
        on the books and records of the company with an amount per unit equal to
        the
        amount per share of any cash dividends declared by the Board of Directors
        on the
        outstanding common stock of the company. The RSUs will be settled in actual
        company shares of common stock upon vesting. Additionally, the number of
        shares
        awarded at the end of the vesting period may be increased or decreased by
        25%
        based on company performance.

The company will measure its performance against three key metrics (i.e.,
        earnings per share, safety, and the operational performance index) during
        the
        three-year vesting period to determine if the target number of shares that
        actually vest will be increased or decreased by the 25% increment, or remain
        at
        the target level. The annual target performance level relating to each metric
        for each year will be established by the Compensation Committee in February
        of
        that year. The actual performance result for each of the three years will
        be
        averaged and compared to the average target level set for each performance
        metric. Depending upon the results of the comparison for each of the three
        metrics, the final award may increase, decrease, or remain at the target
        level.

For
        example:

·

If
                  the
                  company’s average annual performance exceeds target on all three measures,
                  25% additional shares will be awarded at the end of the three-year
                  vesting
                  period;

·

If
                  the
                  company’s average annual performance is below target on all three
                  measures, 25% fewer shares will be awarded at the end of the vesting
                  period; and

·

If
                  the
                  company’s average annual performance exceeds target on some of the
                  measures but is below the target on others, the base number of
                  shares
                  issuable under the RSUs as originally granted will not be increased
                  or
                  decreased.

The Agreement of each Grantee contains share value protection rights that
        are
        triggered in the event of a change in control. Under the share value protection
        provisions, the Grantee is entitled, at vesting, to the highest of three
        values:
        the value of the units as of the day of the grant, the value as of the date
        of
        the change in control, or the value as of the date the restricted units are
        paid
        out by operation of the Plan. If necessary, the share value protection
        provisions trigger a lump sum cash payment to ensure compliance. The share
        value
        protection provisions are not triggered if the Grantee voluntarily terminates
        employment.

On February 21, 2006 the Board of Directors approved the award of Performance
        Shares to the Grantees in accordance with the Plan. The awards are effective
        January 1, 2006, vest at the end of a three-year cycle and are subject to
        the
        terms of the Plan and a performance share agreement, substantially similar
        to
        the Agreement described above, including the presence of share value protection
        provisions. The performance shares are equivalent units of FirstEnergy common
        stock. Dividends accrue on the performance shares during the vesting period
        and
        are converted into additional units. Each Grantee is credited on the books
        and
        records of the company with an amount per unit equal to the amount per share
        of
        any cash dividends declared by the Board of Directors on the outstanding
        common
        stock of the company.

The performance share units are subject to an adjustment based on FirstEnergy’s
        total shareholder return relative to peer companies in the EEI Index. Awards
        can
        be increased by as much as an additional fifty (50) percent or reduced to
        zero
        based on this adjustment. Any awards are paid out in cash at the end of the
        three-year cycle.

On February 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a discretionary RSU
        award
        to Mr. Marsh. Awards of discretionary RSUs vest after five years. Dividends
        accrue on the RSUs during the vesting period and are converted into additional
        units. Mr. Marsh is credited on the books and records of the company with
        an
        amount per unit equal to the amount per share of any cash dividends declared
        by
        the Board of Directors on the outstanding common stock of the company. This
        RSU
        award is subject to an underlying restricted stock agreement; substantially
        similar to the Agreement described above, including the presence of share
        value
        protection provisions, except that there is no performance adjustment made
        to
        the RSUs.

Finally, effective February 27, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a
        Restricted Stock award to Mr. Alexander. This award can vest as early as
        April
        30, 2011, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, but no later than
        April
        30, 2013 and will be paid out in shares of FirstEnergy common stock. Dividends
        accrue on the underlying shares during the vesting period and are converted
        into
        additional shares. Mr. Alexander is credited on the books and records of
        the
        company with an amount per share equal to the amount per share of any cash
        dividends declared by the Board of Directors on the outstanding common stock
        of
        the company. The award, like the others, is subject to an agreement,
        substantially similar to the Agreement described above, including the presence
        of share value protection provisions.

JCP&L
        is
        restating its consolidated financial statements for the two years ended December
        31, 2004. The revisions are a result of a current tax audit from the State
        of
        New Jersey, in which JCP&L became aware that the New Jersey Transitional
        Energy Facilities Assessment tax is not an allowable deduction for state
        income
        tax purposes. See Note 2(I) to JCP&L’s consolidated financial statements for
