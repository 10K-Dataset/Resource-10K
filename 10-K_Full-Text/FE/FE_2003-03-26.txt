Divestitures

     International Operations

           FirstEnergy identified certain former GPU international operations
for divestiture within one year of its merger with GPU, Inc. on November 7,
2001. These operations constitute individual "lines of business" as defined in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 30, "Reporting the Results of
Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," with
physically and operationally separable activities. Application of Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 87-11, "Allocation of Purchase Price to
Assets to Be Sold," required that expected, pre-sale cash flows, including
incremental interest costs on related acquisition debt, of these operations be
considered part of the purchase price allocation. Accordingly, subsequent to the
merger date, results of operations and incremental interest costs related to
these international subsidiaries were not included in FirstEnergy's 2001
Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, assets and liabilities of these
international operations were segregated under separate captions on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001 as "Assets Pending Sale" and
"Liabilities Related to Assets Pending Sale."

           Upon completion of its merger with GPU, FirstEnergy accepted an
October 2001 offer from Aquila, Inc. (formerly UtiliCorp United) to purchase
Avon Energy Partners Holdings (Avon), FirstEnergy's wholly owned holding company
for Midlands Electricity plc, for $2.1 billion (including the assumption of $1.7
billion of debt). The transaction closed on May 8, 2002 and reflected the March
2002 modification of Aquila's initial offer such that Aquila acquired a 79.9
percent equity interest in Avon for approximately $1.9 billion (including the
assumption of $1.7 billion of debt). Proceeds to FirstEnergy were $155 million
in cash and a note receivable for approximately $87 million (representing the
present value of $19 million per year to be received over six years beginning in
2003) from Aquila for its 79.9 percent equity interest. FirstEnergy and Aquila
together own all of the outstanding shares of Avon through a jointly owned
subsidiary, with each company having a 50-percent voting interest. Originally,
in accordance with the accounting guidance described above, the earnings of
those foreign operations were not recognized in current earnings from the date
of the GPU acquisition until February 6, 2002, the date when Aquila began
discussions to revise its initial offer to purchase Avon. However, the revision
to the initial offer by Aquila caused a reversal of that accounting in the first
quarter of 2002, resulting in the recognition of a cumulative effect of a change
in accounting which increased net income by $31.7 million, or $0.11 per share of
common stock, recognizing the net income of Avon from November 7, 2001 to
February 6, 2002 that previously was not recognized by FirstEnergy in its
consolidated earnings. This resulted from the application of guidance provided
by EITF Issue No. 90-6, "Accounting for Certain Events Not Addressed in Issue
No. 87-11 relating to an Acquired Operating Unit to Be Sold," and accounting
under EITF Issue No. 87-11. In the fourth quarter of 2002, FirstEnergy recorded
a $50 million charge ($32.5 million net of tax), or $0.11 per share of common
stock, to reduce the carrying value of its remaining 20.1 percent interest.

           GPU's former Argentina operations were also identified by FirstEnergy
for divestiture within one year of the merger. FirstEnergy determined the fair
value of its Argentina operations, GPU Empresa Distribuidora Electrica Regional
S.A. and affiliates (Emdersa), based on the best available information as of the
date of the merger. Subsequent to that date, a number of economic events have
occurred in Argentina which may have an impact on FirstEnergy's ability to
realize Emdersa's estimated fair value. These events include currency
devaluation, restrictions on repatriation of cash, and the anticipation of
future asset sales in that region by competitors. FirstEnergy did not reach a
definitive agreement to sell Emdersa as of December 31, 2002. Therefore, these
assets were no longer classified as "Assets Pending Sale" on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2002 and Emdersa's results of operations were
included in FirstEnergy's 2002 Consolidated Statement of Income. As a result,
under EITF Issue No. 90-6, FirstEnergy recorded in





the fourth quarter a non-cash cumulative effect of accounting change on its 2002
Consolidated Statement of Income related to Emdersa's cumulative results of
operations from November 7, 2001 through October 31, 2002. The amount of this
after-tax charge was $88.8 million, or $0.30 per share of common stock
(comprised of $104.1 million in currency transaction losses arising principally
from U.S. dollar denominated debt, offset by $15.3 million of operating income).

           On November 1, 2002, FirstEnergy began consolidating the results of
Emdersa's operations in its financial statements. In addition to the currency
transaction losses of $104.1 million, FirstEnergy recognized a currency
translation adjustment in other comprehensive income of $91.5 million as of
December 31, 2002, which reduced FirstEnergy's common stockholders' equity. This
adjustment represents the impact of translating Emdersa's financial statements
from its functional currency to the U.S. dollar for financial reporting in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(GAAP).

         Generating Assets

           In November 2001, FirstEnergy reached an agreement to sell four
coal-fired power plants totaling 2,535 megawatts (MW) to NRG Energy Inc. On
August 8, 2002, FirstEnergy notified NRG that it was canceling the agreement
because NRG stated that it could not complete the transaction under the original
terms of the agreement. FirstEnergy also notified NRG that FirstEnergy reserves
the right to pursue legal action against NRG, its affiliate and its parent, Xcel
Energy, for damages, based on the anticipatory breach of the agreement. On
February 25, 2003, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Minnesota approved FirstEnergy's
request for arbitration against NRG.

           In December 2002, FirstEnergy announced it would retain ownership of
these plants after reviewing other bids it subsequently received from other
parties who had expressed interest in purchasing the plants. Since FirstEnergy
did not execute a sales agreement by year-end, it reflected approximately $74
million ($43 million net of tax), or $0.15 per share of common stock, of
previously unrecognized depreciation and transaction costs in the fourth quarter
of 2002 related to these plants from November 2001 through December 2002 on its
Consolidated Statement of Income.

Utility Regulation

           As a registered public utility holding company, FirstEnergy is
subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (1935 Act). The SEC has determined
that the electric facilities of the Companies constitute a single integrated
public utility system under the standards of the 1935 Act. The 1935 Act
regulates FirstEnergy with respect to accounting, the issuance of securities,
the acquisition and sale of utility assets, securities or any other interest in
any business, and entering into, and performance of, service, sales and
construction contracts among its subsidiaries, and certain other matters. The
1935 Act also limits the extent to which FirstEnergy may engage in nonutility
businesses or acquire additional utility businesses. Each of the Companies'
retail rates, conditions of service, issuance of securities and other matters
are subject to regulation in the state in which each operates - in Ohio by the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), in New Jersey by the New Jersey
Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and in Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Public
Utility Commission (PPUC). With respect to their wholesale and interstate
electric operations and rates, the Companies are subject to regulation,
including regulation of their accounting policies and practices, by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Under Ohio law, municipalities may regulate
rates, subject to appeal to the PUCO if not acceptable to the utility.

           In Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, laws applicable to electric
industry deregulation included the similar provisions which are reflected in the
Companies' respective state regulatory plans:

           o  allowing the Companies' electric customers to select their
              generation suppliers;

           o  establishing provider of last resort (PLR) obligations to
              customers in the Companies' service areas;

           o  allowing recovery of potentially stranded investment (sometimes
               referred to as transition costs);

           o  itemizing  (unbundling) the current price of electricity  into its
              component  elements - including  generation,  transmission,
              distribution and stranded costs recovery charges;

           o  deregulating the Companies' electric generation businesses; and

           o  continuing regulation of the Companies' transmission and
              distribution systems.





         PUCO Rate Matters

           In July 1999, Ohio's electric utility restructuring legislation,
which allowed Ohio electric customers to select their generation suppliers
beginning January 1, 2001, was signed into law. Among other things, the
legislation provided for a 5% reduction on the generation portion of residential
customers' bills and the opportunity to recover transition costs, including
regulatory assets, from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2005 (market
development period). The period for the recovery of regulatory assets only can
be extended up to December 31, 2010. The PUCO was authorized to determine the
level of transition cost recovery, as well as the recovery period for the
regulatory assets portion of those costs, in considering each Ohio electric
utility's transition plan application.

           In July 2000, the PUCO approved FirstEnergy's transition plan for the
OE, CEI and TE (Ohio Companies) as modified by a settlement agreement with major
parties to the transition plan. The application of SFAS 71, "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" to OE's generation business and the
nonnuclear generation businesses of CEI and TE was discontinued with the
issuance of the PUCO transition plan order, as described further below. Major
provisions of the settlement agreement consisted of approval of recovery of
generation-related transition costs as filed of $4.0 billion net of deferred
income taxes (OE-$1.6 billion, CEI-$1.6 billion and TE-$0.8 billion) and
transition costs related to regulatory assets as filed of $2.9 billion net of
deferred income taxes (OE-$1.0 billion, CEI-$1.4 billion and TE-$0.5 billion),
with recovery through no later than 2006 for OE, mid-2007 for TE and 2008 for
CEI, except where a longer period of recovery is provided for in the settlement
agreement. The generation-related transition costs include $1.4 billion, net of
deferred income taxes, (OE-$1.0 billion, CEI-$0.2 billion and TE-$0.2 billion)
of impaired generating assets recognized as regulatory assets as described
further below, $2.4 billion, net of deferred income taxes, (OE-$1.2 billion,
CEI-$0.4 billion and TE-$0.8 billion) of above market operating lease costs and
$0.8 billion, net of deferred income taxes, (CEI-$0.5 billion and TE-$0.3
billion) of additional plant costs that were reflected on CEI's and TE's
regulatory financial statements.

           Also as part of the settlement agreement, FirstEnergy is giving
preferred access over its subsidiaries to nonaffiliated marketers, brokers and
aggregators to 1,120 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity through 2005 at
established prices for sales to the Ohio Companies' retail customers. Customer
prices are frozen through the five-year market development period except for
certain limited statutory exceptions, including the 5% reduction referred to
above. In February 2003, the Ohio Companies were authorized increases in annual
revenues aggregating approximately $50 million (OE-$41 million, CEI-$4 million
and TE-$5 million) to recover their higher tax costs resulting from the Ohio
deregulation legislation.

           FirstEnergy's Ohio customers choosing alternative suppliers receive
an additional incentive applied to the shopping credit (generation component) of
45% for residential customers, 30% for commercial customers and 15% for
industrial customers. The amount of the incentive is deferred for future
recovery from customers - recovery will be accomplished by extending the
respective transition cost recovery period. If the customer shopping goals
established in the agreement had not been achieved by the end of 2005, the
transition cost recovery periods could have been shortened for OE, CEI and TE to
reduce recovery by as much as $500 million (OE - $250 million, CEI - $170
million and TE - $80 million). The Ohio Companies achieved all of their required
20% customer shopping goals in 2002. Accordingly, FirstEnergy believes that
there will be no regulatory action reducing the recoverable transition costs.

         NJBPU Rate Matters

           JCP&L's 2001 Final Decision and Order (Final Order) with respect to
its rate unbundling, stranded cost and restructuring filings confirmed rate
reductions set forth in its 1999 Summary Order, which remain in effect at
increasing levels through July 2003. The Final Order also confirmed the
establishment of a non-bypassable societal benefits charge (SBC) to recover
costs which include nuclear plant decommissioning and manufactured gas plant
remediation, as well as a non-bypassable market transition charge (MTC)
primarily to recover stranded costs. The NJBPU has deferred making a final
determination of the net proceeds and stranded costs related to prior generating
asset divestitures until JCP&L's request for an Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
ruling regarding the treatment of associated federal income tax benefits is
acted upon. Should the IRS ruling support the return of the tax benefits to
customers, there would be no effect to FirstEnergy's or JCP&L's net income since
the contingency existed prior to the merger.

           In addition, the Final Order provided for the ability to securitize
stranded costs associated with the divested Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating
Station. In February 2002, JCP&L received NJBPU authorization to issue $320
million of transition bonds to securitize the recovery of these costs. The NJBPU
order also provided for a usage-based non-bypassable transition bond charge and
for the transfer of the bondable transition property to another entity. JCP&L
sold $320 million of transition bonds through its wholly owned subsidiary, JCP&L
Transition Funding LLC, in June 2002 - those bonds are recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

           JCP&L's PLR obligation to provide basic generation service (BGS) to
non-shopping customers is supplied almost entirely from contracted and open
market purchases. JCP&L is permitted to defer for future collection from
customers the amounts by which its costs of supplying BGS to non-shopping
customers and costs incurred under nonutility generation (NUG) agreements exceed
amounts collected through BGS and MTC rates. As of December 31, 2002, the
accumulated deferred cost balance totaled approximately $549 million. The NJBPU
also allowed securitization




of JCP&L's deferred balance to the extent permitted by law upon application by
JCP&L and a determination by the NJBPU that the conditions of the New Jersey
restructuring legislation are met. There can be no assurance as to the extent,
if any, that the NJBPU will permit such securitization.

           Under New Jersey transition legislation, all electric distribution
companies were required to file rate cases to determine the level of unbundled
rate components to become effective August 1, 2003. On August 1, 2002, JCP&L
submitted two rate filings with the NJBPU. The first filing requested increases
in base electric rates of approximately $98 million annually. The second filing
was a request to recover deferred costs that exceeded amounts being recovered
under the current MTC and SBC rates; one proposed method of recovery of these
costs is the securitization of the deferred balance. This securitization
methodology is similar to the Oyster Creek securitization discussed above.
Hearings began in February 2003. On March 18, 2003, a report prepared by
independent auditors addressing costs deferred by JCP&L from August 1, 1999
through July 31, 2002, was transmitted to the Office of Administrative Law,
where JCP&L's rate case is being heard. While the auditors concluded that
JCP&L's energy procurement strategy and process was reasonable and prudent, they
identified potential disallowances totaling $17.3 million. The report subjected
$436 million of deferred costs to a retrospective prudence review during a
period of extreme price uncertainty and volatility in the energy markets.
Although JCP&L disagrees with the potential disallowances, it is pleased with
the report's major conclusions and overall tone. JCP&L will have an opportunity
to conduct discovery on the report, cross-examine the auditors and submit
rebuttal testimony. The Administrative Law Judge's recommended decision is due
in June 2003 and the NJBPU's subsequent decision is due in July 2003.

           In December 2001, the NJBPU authorized the auctioning of BGS for the
period from August 1, 2002 through July 31, 2003 to meet the electricity demands
of all customers who have not selected an alternative supplier. The auction
results were approved by the NJBPU in February 2002, removing JCP&L's BGS
obligation of 5,100 MW for the period August 1, 2002 through July 31, 2003. In
February 2003, the NJBPU approved the BGS auction results for the period
beginning August 1, 2003. The auction covered a fixed price bid (applicable to
all residential and smaller commercial and industrial customers) and an hourly
price bid (applicable to all large industrial customers) process. JCP&L will
sell all self-supplied energy (NUGs and owned generation) to the wholesale
market with offsets to its deferred energy balances.

         PPUC Rate Matters

           The PPUC authorized 1998 rate restructuring plans for Penn, Met-Ed
and Penelec. In 2000, the PPUC disallowed a portion of the requested additional
stranded costs above those amounts granted in Met-Ed's and Penelec's 1998 rate
restructuring plan orders. The PPUC required Met-Ed and Penelec to seek an IRS
ruling regarding the return of certain unamortized investment tax credits and
excess deferred income tax benefits to customers. Similar to JCP&L's situation,
if the IRS ruling ultimately supports returning these tax benefits to customers,
there would be no effect to FirstEnergy's, Met-Ed's or Penelec's net income
since the contingency existed prior to the merger.

           As a result of their generating asset divestitures, Met-Ed and
Penelec obtained their supply of electricity to meet their PLR obligations
almost entirely from contracted and open market purchases. In 2000, Met-Ed and
Penelec filed a petition with the PPUC seeking permission to defer, for future
recovery, energy costs in excess of amounts reflected in their capped generation
rates; the PPUC subsequently consolidated this petition in January 2001 with the
FirstEnergy/GPU merger proceeding.

           In June 2001, the PPUC entered orders approving the Settlement
Stipulation with all of the major parties in the combined merger and rate relief
proceedings which approved the merger and provided Met-Ed and Penelec PLR
deferred accounting treatment for energy costs. The PPUC permitted Met-Ed and
Penelec to defer for future recovery the difference between their actual energy
costs and those reflected in their capped generation rates, retroactive to
January 1, 2001. Correspondingly, in the event that energy costs incurred by
Met-Ed and Penelec would be below their respective capped generation rates, that
difference would have reduced costs that had been deferred for recovery in
future periods. This PLR deferral accounting procedure was denied in a court
decision discussed below. Met-Ed's and Penelec's PLR obligations extend through
December 31, 2010; during that period competitive transition charge (CTC)
revenues would have been applied to their stranded costs. Met-Ed and Penelec
would have been permitted to recover any remaining stranded costs through a
continuation of the CTC after December 31, 2010 through no later than December
31, 2015. Any amounts not expected to be recovered by December 31, 2015 would
have been written off at the time such nonrecovery became probable.

           Several parties had filed Petitions for Review in June and July 2001
with the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania regarding the June 2001 PPUC orders.
On February 21, 2002, the Court affirmed the PPUC decision regarding the
FirstEnergy/GPU merger, remanding the decision to the PPUC only with respect to
the issue of merger savings. The Court reversed the PPUC's decision regarding
the PLR obligations of Met-Ed and Penelec, and rejected those parts of the
settlement that permitted the companies to defer for accounting purposes the
difference between their wholesale power costs and the amount that they collect
from retail customers. FirstEnergy and the PPUC each filed a Petition for
Allowance of Appeal with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on March 25, 2002,
asking it to review the Commonwealth Court decision. Also on March 25, 2002,
Citizens Power filed a motion seeking an appeal of the Commonwealth Court's
decision to affirm the FirstEnergy and GPU merger with the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court. In




September 2002, FirstEnergy established reserves for Met-Ed's and
Penelec's PLR deferred energy costs which aggregated $287.1 million. The
reserves reflected the potential adverse impact of a pending Pennsylvania
Supreme Court decision whether to review the Commonwealth Court ruling.
FirstEnergy recorded an aggregate non-cash charge to income of $55.8 million
($32.6 million net of tax), or $0.11 per share of common stock, for the deferred
costs incurred subsequent to the merger. The reserve for the remaining $231.3
million of deferred costs increased goodwill by an aggregate net of tax amount
of $135.3 million.

           On January 17, 2003, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied further
appeals of the February 21, 2002 Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court decision, which
effectively affirmed the PPUC's order approving the merger between FirstEnergy
and GPU, let stand the Commonwealth Court's denial of PLR rate relief for Met-Ed
and Penelec and remanded the merger savings issue back to the PPUC. Because
FirstEnergy had already reserved for the deferred energy costs and FES has
largely hedged the anticipated PLR energy supply requirements for Met-Ed and
Penelec through 2005 as discussed further below, FirstEnergy, Met-Ed and Penelec
believe that the disallowance of continued CTC recovery of PLR costs will not
have a future adverse financial impact.

           Effective September 1, 2002, Met-Ed and Penelec assigned their PLR
responsibility to their FES affiliate through a wholesale power sale agreement.
The PLR sale, which initially ran through the end of 2002, was extended through
December 2003 and will be automatically extended for each successive calendar
year unless any party elects to cancel the agreement by November 1 of the
preceding year. Under the terms of the wholesale agreement, FES assumes the
supply obligation and the energy supply profit and loss risk, for the portion of
power supply requirements not self-supplied by Met-Ed and Penelec under their
NUG contracts and other existing power contracts with nonaffiliated third party
suppliers. This arrangement reduces Met-Ed's and Penelec's exposure to high
wholesale power prices by providing power at or below the shopping credit for
their uncommitted PLR energy costs during the term of the agreement with FES.
FES has hedged most of Met-Ed's and Penelec's unfilled PLR obligation through
2005, the period during which deferred accounting was previously allowed under
the PPUC's order. Met-Ed and Penelec are authorized to continue deferring
differences between NUG contract costs and amounts recovered through their
capped generation rates.

         FERC Rate Matters

           The Companies provide wholesale power and transmission service
subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC.

           Following the FirstEnergy/GPU merger the transmission facilities of
JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec continue to be operated by PJM. PJM was approved by
the FERC as a regional transmission organization (RTO) on December 20, 2002.
Transmission service over the facilities of FirstEnergy's PJM operating
companies is provided under the PJM Open Access Tariff.

           On December 20, 2001, the FERC issued an order that reversed prior
findings that the Alliance RTO had adequate scope and concluded that there
should be only one RTO (the Midwest ISO) in the Midwest. The FERC directed the
former Alliance companies, including ATSI, to file their new RTO choices with
the FERC. On July 31, 2002, the FERC approved the RTO choices of the former
Alliance companies, but directed the formation of a single market for the MISO
and PJM by October 1, 2004. This single market would include all of the
generation and transmission facilities of the FirstEnergy operating companies.
FERC also initiated an investigation pursuant to Section 206 of the Federal
Power Act concerning the existing "through and out" transmission rates between
the MISO and PJM. Hearings on this proceeding concluded in January 2003, and an
Initial Decision is expected from the Administrative Law Judge by March 28,
2003.

           ATSI proposes to transfer its transmission facilities in the East
Central Area Reliability Agreement (ECAR) area to the MISO RTO as part of
GridAmerica, LLC, an independent transmission company. On December 19, 2002, the
FERC conditionally accepted GridAmerica's filing to become an independent
transmission company within the MISO. GridAmerica will operate ATSI's
transmission facilities and expects to begin operations in the second quarter of
2003 subject to approval of certain compliance filings with the FERC. The
compliance filings were made by the GridAmerica companies (ATSI, Ameren Services
Company and Northern Indiana Public Service Company) on January 31, 2003 and
February 19, 2003.

           On July 31, 2002, the FERC initiated a rulemaking designed to
standardize the terms and conditions under which wholesale electric service is
provided in regions with independent transmission operators, including the MISO
and PJM. FirstEnergy filed comments and reply comments on the proposed rule.
Implementation of the proposed rule was expected to begin on July 31, 2003.
However, the FERC has indicated that it will delay implementation of Standard
Market Design in order to accommodate substantial changes in the proposed rule.
A FERC "white paper" is expected to be issued in April 2003 outlining changes in
the proposed rule.

         Regulatory Accounting

           All of the Companies' regulatory assets (deferred costs) are expected
to continue to be recovered under provisions of the Ohio transition plan and the
respective Pennsylvania and New Jersey regulatory plans. The application




of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for
the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS 71), has been discontinued
with respect to the Companies' generation operations.

Capital Requirements

           Capital expenditures for the Companies, FES and FirstEnergy's other
subsidiaries for the years 2002 through 2007, excluding nuclear fuel, are shown

           The Companies' and FES's respective investments for additional
nuclear fuel, and nuclear fuel investment reductions as the fuel is consumed,
during the 2003-2007 period are presented in the following table. The table also
displays the Companies' operating lease commitments, net of capital trust cash
receipts for the 2003-2007 period.



           Short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2002, consisted
of $1.093 billion of bank borrowings (FirstEnergy-$910.0 million, OE-$22.6
million and FSG-$0.5 million) and $159.7 million of OES Capital, Incorporated
commercial paper. OES Capital is a wholly owned subsidiary of OE whose
borrowings are secured by customer accounts receivable. OES Capital can borrow
up to $170 million under a receivables financing agreement at rates based on
certain bank commercial paper. FirstEnergy had $177 million available under $1.5
billion of revolving lines of credit as of December 31, 2002. FirstEnergy may
borrow under its facility and could transfer any of its borrowings to affiliated




companies. OE and MYR had $19 million and $46 million, respectively, of unused
bank facilities as of December 31, 2002. An additional source of ongoing cash
for FirstEnergy, as a holding company, is cash dividends from its subsidiaries.
In 2002, the holding company received $447 million of cash dividends on common
stock from its subsidiaries.

           Based on their present plans, the Companies could provide for their
cash requirements in 2003 from the following sources: funds to be received from
operations; available cash and temporary cash investments as of December 31,
2002 (Company's nonutility subsidiaries-$93 million, OE-$20 million, Penn-$1
million, CEI-$30 million, TE-$21 million, JCP&L-$5 million, Met-Ed-$16 million
and Penelec-$10 million); the issuance of long-term debt (for refunding
purposes); and funds available under revolving credit arrangements.

           The extent and type of future financings will depend on the need for
external funds as well as market conditions, the maintenance of an appropriate
capital structure and the ability of the Companies to comply with coverage
requirements in order to issue first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. The
Companies will continue to monitor financial market conditions and, where
appropriate, may take advantage of economic opportunities to refund debt and
preferred stock to the extent that their financial resources permit.

          The coverage requirements contained in the first mortgage indentures
under which the Companies issue first mortgage bonds provide that, except for
certain refunding purposes, the Companies may not issue first mortgage bonds
unless applicable net earnings (before income taxes), calculated as provided in
the indentures, for any period of twelve consecutive months within the fifteen
calendar months preceding the month in which such additional bonds are issued,
are at least twice annual interest requirements on outstanding first mortgage
bonds, including those being issued. Under OE's first mortgage indenture, the
availability of property additions is more restrictive than the earnings test at
the present time and would limit the amount of first mortgage bonds issuable
against property additions to $172 million. OE is currently able to issue $1.195
billion principal amount of first mortgage bonds against previously retired
bonds without the need to meet the above restrictions. Under Penn's first
mortgage indenture, other requirements also apply and are more restrictive than
the earnings test at the present time. Penn is currently able to issue $323
million principal amount of first mortgage bonds, with up to $150 million of
such amount issuable against property additions; the remainder could be issued
against previously retired bonds. CEI and TE can issue $379 million and $144
million principal amount of first mortgage bonds against a combination of
previously retired bonds and property additions, respectively. JCP&L, Met-Ed and
Penelec are able to issue $393 million, $74 million and $7 million principal
amount, respectively, of first mortgage bonds against previously retired bonds.


           OE's, Penn's, TE's and JCP&L's respective articles of incorporation
prohibit the sale of preferred stock unless applicable gross income, calculated
as provided in the articles of incorporation, is equal to at least 1-1/2 times
the aggregate of the annual interest requirements on indebtedness and annual
dividend requirements on preferred stock outstanding immediately thereafter.
Based upon earnings for 2002, an assumed dividend rate of 9%, and no additional
indebtedness, OE, Penn and JCP&L would be permitted, under the earnings coverage
test contained in their respective charters, to issue at least $2.8 billion,
$251 million and $1.2 billion of preferred stock, respectively. TE cannot
currently issue preferred stock. There are no restrictions on the ability of
CEI, Met-Ed and Penelec to issue preferred stock.

           To the extent that coverage requirements or market conditions
restrict the Companies' abilities to issue desired amounts of first mortgage
bonds or preferred stock, the Companies may seek other methods of financing.
Such financings could include the sale of preferred and/or preference stock or
of such other types of securities as might be authorized by applicable
regulatory authorities which would not otherwise be sold and could result in
annual interest charges and/or dividend requirements in excess of those that
would otherwise be incurred.

         Met-Ed Capital Trust and Penelec Capital Trust

           In 1999, Met-Ed Capital Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of Met-Ed,
issued $100 million of trust preferred securities (Met-Ed Trust Preferred
Securities) at 7.35%, due 2039. The sole assets of Met-Ed Capital Trust are the
7.35% Cumulative Preferred Securities of Met-Ed Capital II, L.P. (Met-Ed
Partnership Preferred Securities) and its only







revenues are the quarterly cash distributions it receives on the Met-Ed
Partnership Preferred Securities. Each Met-Ed Trust Preferred Security
represents a Met-Ed Partnership Preferred Security. Met-Ed Capital II, L.P. is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Met-Ed and the sponsor of Met-Ed Capital Trust. The
sole assets of Met-Ed Capital II, L.P. are Met-Ed's 7.35% Subordinated
Debentures, Series A, due 2039, which have an aggregate principal amount of
$103.1 million. Distributions were made on the Trust Preferred Securities during
2002 in the aggregate amount of $7,350,000. Expenses of Met-Ed Trust for 2002
were approximately $13,000, all of which were paid by Met-Ed Preferred Capital
II, Inc., the general partner of Met-Ed Capital II, L.P. The Trust Preferred
Securities are issued in book-entry form only so that there is only one holder
of record. Met-Ed has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Met-Ed
Partnership Preferred Securities, and, therefore, the Met-Ed Trust Preferred
Securities.

           In 1999, Penelec Capital Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of Penelec,
issued $100 million of trust preferred securities (Penelec Trust Preferred
Securities) at 7.34%, due 2039. The sole assets of Penelec Capital Trust are the
7.34% Cumulative Preferred Securities of Penelec Capital II, L.P. (Penelec
Partnership Preferred Securities) and its only




revenues are the quarterly cash distributions it receives on the Penelec
Partnership Preferred Securities. Each Penelec Trust Preferred Security
represents a Penelec Partnership Preferred Security. Penelec Capital II, L.P. is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penelec and the sponsor of Penelec Capital Trust.
The sole assets of Penelec Capital II, L.P. are Penelec's 7.34% Subordinated
Debentures, Series A, due 2039, which have an aggregate principal amount of
$103.1 million. Distributions were made on the Trust Preferred Securities during
2002 in the aggregate amount of $7,340,000. Expenses of Penelec Trust for 2002
were approximately $13,000, all of which were paid by Penelec Preferred Capital
II, Inc., the general partner of Penelec Capital II, L.P. The Trust Preferred
Securities are issued in book-entry form only so that there is only one holder
of record. Penelec has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Penelec
Partnership Preferred Securities, and, therefore, the Penelec Trust Preferred
Securities.


Nuclear Regulation

           The construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear generating
units are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) including the issuance by it of construction permits, operating
licenses, and possession only licenses for decommissioning reactors. The NRC's
procedures with respect to the amendment of nuclear reactor operating licenses
afford opportunities for interested parties to request adjudicatory hearings on
health, safety and environmental issues subject to meeting NRC "standing"
requirements. The NRC may require substantial changes in operation or the
installation of additional equipment to meet safety or environmental standards,
subject to the backfit rule requiring the NRC to justify such new requirements
as necessary for the overall protection of public health and safety. The
possibility also exists for modification, denial or revocation of licenses. As a
result of the merger with GPU, FirstEnergy now owns the Three Mile Island Unit 2
(TMI-2) and the Saxton Nuclear Experimental Facility. Both facilities are in
various stages of decommissioning. TMI-2 is in a post-defueling monitored
storage condition, with decommissioning planned in 2014. Saxton is in the final
stages of decommissioning, with license termination scheduled for the end of
2003 and final site restoration scheduled for the first quarter of 2003. Beaver
Valley Unit 1 was placed in commercial operation in 1976, and its operating
license expires in 2016. Davis-Besse was placed in commercial operation in 1977,
and its operating license expires in 2017. Perry Unit 1 and Beaver Valley Unit 2
were placed in commercial operation in 1987, and their operating licenses expire
in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

           Davis-Besse, which is operated by FENOC, began its scheduled
refueling outage on February 16, 2002. The plant was originally scheduled to
return to service by the end of March 2002. During the refueling outage, visual
and ultrasonic testings were conducted on all 69 of the Control Rod Drive
Mechanism penetration nozzles. This testing was performed to check for the kind
of circular or circumferential cracking in these nozzles that had been found at
some other plants similar in design and vintage to Davis-Besse. Based on the
inspection and test results, five nozzles were scheduled for repair during the
refueling outage.

           As repair work began on one of the nozzles, FENOC found corrosion in
the reactor vessel head near some of the penetration holes, created by boric
acid deposits from leaks in the nozzles. As a result, the NRC issued a
confirmatory action letter stating that restart of the plant would be subject to
prior NRC approval, and it established an Inspection Manual Chapter 0350
Oversight Panel to ensure close NRC oversight of Davis-Besse's corrective
actions.

           In response to the reactor vessel head degradation, FENOC initiated a
number of root cause analyses and other assessments, and established a Return to
Service Plan to correct the causes and ensure a safe and reliable return to
service. The Return to Service Plan includes actions to: replace the reactor
vessel head, inspect and correct other components in the containment that may
have been affected by boric acid, review important systems and programs to
ensure their readiness for restart, and improve management and human
performance. FENOC has completed many of the actions under the Return to Service
Plan and is currently implementing corrective actions and performing tests to
ensure the readiness of the plant to restart.

           FENOC's current schedule projects having the plant available for
restart in April of 2003. However, the NRC must authorize restart of the plant
following its formal inspection process before the unit can be returned to
service. In 2002, FENOC spent approximately $115 million in additional
nuclear-related operation and maintenance costs, approximately $120 million in
replacement power costs and approximately $63 million in capital expenditures
related to the reactor head and restart. For 2003, FENOC expects to spend
approximately $50 million in additional nuclear-related operation and
maintenance costs and approximately $12-18 million in replacement power costs
per month. These costs could increase if the length of the outage increases.

           The NRC has promulgated and continues to promulgate orders and
regulations related to the safe operation of nuclear power plants and standards
for decommissioning clean-up and final license termination. The Companies cannot
predict what additional orders and regulations (including post-September 11,
2001 security enhancements) may be promulgated, design changes required or the
effect that any such regulations or design changes or additional clean-up
standards for final site release, or the consideration thereof, may have upon
their nuclear plants. Although the Companies have no reason to anticipate an
accident at any of their nuclear plants, if such an accident did happen, it
could have a material but currently undeterminable adverse effect on
FirstEnergy's consolidated financial position. In addition, such an accident at
any operating nuclear plant, whether or not owned by the Companies, could result
in regulations or requirements that could affect the operation, licensing, or
decommissioning of plants that the Companies





do own with a consequent but currently undeterminable adverse impact, and could
affect the Companies' abilities to raise funds in the capital markets.

Nuclear Insurance

           The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability which can be
assessed with respect to a nuclear power plant to $9.5 billion (assuming 105
units licensed to operate) for a single nuclear incident, which amount is
covered by: (i) private insurance amounting to $300 million; and (ii) $9.2
billion provided by an industry retrospective rating plan required by the NRC
pursuant thereto. Under such retrospective rating plan, in the event of a
nuclear incident at any unit in the United States resulting in losses in excess
of private insurance, up to $88.1 million (but not more than $10 million per
unit per year in the event of more than one incident) must be contributed for
each nuclear unit licensed to operate in the country by the licensees thereof to
cover liabilities arising out of the incident. Based on their present nuclear
ownership and leasehold interests, the Companies' maximum potential assessment
under these provisions would be $352.4 million (OE-$94.2 million, Penn-$74.0
million, CEI-$106.3 million and TE-$77.9 million) per incident but not more than
$40.0 million (OE-$10.7 million, Penn-$8.4 million, CEI-$12.1 million and
TE-$8.8 million) in any one year for each incident.

           In addition to the public liability insurance provided pursuant to
the Price-Anderson Act, the Companies have also obtained insurance coverage in
limited amounts for economic loss and property damage arising out of nuclear
incidents. The Companies are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited
(NEIL) which provides coverage (NEIL I) for the extra expense of replacement
power incurred due to prolonged accidental outages of nuclear units. Under NEIL
I, the Companies have policies, renewable yearly, corresponding to their
respective nuclear interests, which provide an aggregate indemnity of up to
approximately $1.182 billion (OE-$315 million, Penn-$222 million, CEI-$382
million and TE-$263 million) for replacement power costs incurred during an
outage after an initial 12-week waiting period. Members of NEIL I pay annual
premiums and are subject to assessments if losses exceed the accumulated funds
available to the insurer. The Companies' present maximum aggregate assessment
for incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring during a policy year
would be approximately $11.1 million (OE-$3.1 million, Penn-$2.2 million,
CEI-$3.4 million and TE-$2.4 million).

           The Companies are insured as to their respective nuclear interests
under property damage insurance provided by NEIL to the operating company for
each plant. Under these arrangements, $2.75 billion of coverage for
decontamination costs, decommissioning costs, debris removal and repair and/or
replacement of property is provided. The Companies pay annual premiums for this
coverage and are liable for retrospective assessments of up to approximately
$57.3 million (OE-$15.5 million, Penn-$10.9 million, CEI-$17.9 million, TE-$12.2
million, JCP&L-$0.2 million, Met-Ed-$0.4 million and Penelec-$0.2 million)
during a policy year.

           The Companies intend to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as
described above as long as it is available. To the extent that replacement
power, property damage, decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement
costs and other such costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of the
Companies' plants exceed the policy limits of the insurance in effect with
respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be
covered by the Companies' insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance
becomes unavailable in the future, the Companies would remain at risk for such
costs.

           The NRC requires nuclear power plant licensees to obtain minimum
property insurance coverage of $1.06 billion or the amount generally available
from private sources, whichever is less. The proceeds of this insurance are
required to be used first to ensure that the licensed reactor is in a safe and
stable condition and can be maintained in that condition so as to prevent any
significant risk to the public health and safety. Within 30 days of
stabilization, the licensee is required to prepare and submit to the NRC a
cleanup plan for approval. The plan is required to identify all cleanup
operations necessary to decontaminate the reactor sufficiently to permit the
resumption of operations or to commence decommissioning. Any property insurance
proceeds not already expended to place the reactor in a safe and stable
condition must be used first to complete those decontamination operations that
are ordered by the NRC. The Companies are unable to predict what effect these
requirements may have on the availability of insurance proceeds to the Companies
for the Companies' bondholders.

Environmental Matters

           Various federal, state and local authorities regulate the Companies
with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters.
FirstEnergy estimates additional capital expenditures for environmental
compliance of approximately $159 million, which is included in the construction
forecast provided under "Capital Requirements" for 2003 through 2007.

         Air Regulation

           Under the provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1970, the States of Ohio
and New Jersey and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have adopted ambient air
quality standards, and related emission limits, including limits for sulfur
dioxide






(SO2) and particulates. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) promulgated an SO2 regulatory plan for Ohio which became effective for
OE's, CEI's and TE's plants in 1977. Generating plants to be constructed in the
future and some future modifications of existing facilities will be covered not
only by the applicable state standards but also by EPA emission performance
standards for new sources. In Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania the construction
or certain modifications of emission sources requires approval from appropriate
environmental authorities, and the facilities involved may not be operated
unless a permit or variance to do so has been issued by those same authorities.

           The Companies are required to meet federally approved SO2
regulations. Violations of such regulations can result in shutdown of the
generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to $31,500 for
each day the unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim enforcement policy for
SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for compliance based on a 30-day averaging
period. The Companies cannot predict what action the EPA may take in the future
with respect to the interim enforcement policy.

           The Companies believe they are in compliance with the current SO2 and
nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990. SO2 reductions are being achieved by burning lower-sulfur fuel,
generating more electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using emission
allowances. NOx reductions are being achieved through combustion controls and
the generation of more electricity at lower-emitting plants. In September 1998,
the EPA finalized regulations requiring additional NOx reductions from the
Companies' Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania facilities. The EPA's NOx Transport
Rule imposes uniform reductions of NOx emissions (an approximate 85% reduction
in utility plant NOx emissions from projected 2007 emissions) across a region of
nineteen states and the District of Columbia, including New Jersey, Ohio and
Pennsylvania, based on a conclusion that such NOx emissions are contributing
significantly to ozone pollution in the eastern United States. State
Implementation Plans (SIP) must comply by May 31, 2004 with individual state NOx
budgets established by the EPA. Pennsylvania submitted a SIP that requires
compliance with the NOx budgets at the Companies' Pennsylvania facilities by May
1, 2003 and Ohio submitted a SIP that requires compliance with the NOx budgets
at the Companies' Ohio facilities by May 31, 2004. The Companies continue to
evaluate their compliance plans and other compliance options.

           In July 1997, the EPA promulgated changes in the National Ambient Air
Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone emissions and proposed a new NAAQS for
previously unregulated ultra-fine particulate matter. In May 1999, the U.S.
Court of Appeals found constitutional and other defects in the new NAAQS rules.
In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the new NAAQS rules regulating
ultra-fine particulates but found defects in the new NAAQS rules for ozone and
decided that the EPA must revise those rules. The future cost of compliance with
these regulations may be substantial and will depend if and how they are
ultimately implemented by the states in which the Companies operate affected
facilities.

           In 1999 and 2000, the EPA issued Notices of Violation (NOV) or a
Compliance Order to nine utilities covering 44 power plants, including the W. H.
Sammis Plant. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice filed eight civil
complaints against various investor-owned utilities, which included a complaint
against OE and Penn in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Ohio, for which hearings began on February 3, 2003. The NOV and complaint allege
violations of the Clean Air Act based on operation and maintenance of the Sammis
Plant dating back to 1984. The complaint requests permanent injunctive relief to
require the installation of "best available control technology" and civil
penalties of up to $27,500 per day of violation. Although unable to predict the
outcome of these proceedings, FirstEnergy believes the Sammis Plant is in full
compliance with the Clean Air Act and the NOV and complaint are without merit.
Penalties could be imposed if the Sammis Plant continues to operate without
correcting the alleged violations and a court determines that the allegations
are valid. The Sammis Plant continues to operate while these proceedings are
pending.

           In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the
development of regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric
power plants. The EPA identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of
greatest concern. The EPA established a schedule to propose regulations by
December 2003 and issue final regulations by December 2004. The future cost of
compliance with these regulations may be substantial.

         Water Regulation

           Various water quality regulations, the majority of which are the
result of the federal Clean Water Act and its amendments, apply to the
Companies' plants. In addition, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have water
quality standards applicable to the Companies' operations. As provided in the
Clean Water Act, authority to grant federal National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System water discharge permits can be assumed by a state. Ohio, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania have assumed such authority.

         Waste Disposal

           As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state
hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel
combustion waste products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future
regulation. The EPA has issued its final regulatory determination that
regulation of





coal ash as a hazardous waste is unnecessary. In April 2000, the EPA announced
that it will develop national standards regulating disposal of coal ash under
its authority to regulate nonhazardous waste.

           The Companies have been named as "potentially responsible parties"
(PRPs) at waste disposal sites which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of
disposal of hazardous substances at historical sites and the liability involved
are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute; however, federal law provides
that all PRPs for a particular site be held liable on a joint and several basis.
Therefore, potential environmental liabilities have been recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2002, based on estimates of the
total costs of cleanup, the Companies' proportionate responsibility for such
costs and the financial ability of other nonaffiliated entities to pay. In
addition, JCP&L has accrued liabilities for environmental remediation of former
manufactured gas plants in New Jersey; those costs are being recovered by JCP&L
through its SBC. The Companies have total accrued liabilities aggregating
approximately $54.3 million as of December 31, 2002.

           In 1980, Congress passed the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act
which provides that the disposal of low-level radioactive waste is the
responsibility of the state where such waste is generated. The Act encourages
states to form compacts among themselves to develop regional disposal
facilities. Failure by a state or compact to begin implementation of a program
could result in access denial to the two facilities currently accepting
low-level radioactive waste. Ohio is part of the Midwest Compact and has
responsibility for siting and constructing a disposal facility. On June 26,
1997, the Midwest Compact Commission (Compact) voted to cease all siting
activities in the host state of Ohio and to dismantle the Ohio Low-Level
Radioactive Waste Facility Development Authority, the statutory agency charged
with siting and constructing the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility.
While the Compact remains intact, it has no plans to site or construct a
low-level radioactive waste disposal facility in the Midwest. The Companies
continue to ship low-level radioactive waste from their nuclear facilities to
the Barnwell, South Carolina waste disposal facility.

         Summary

           Environmental controls are still developing and require, in many
instances, balancing the needs for additional quantities of energy in future
years and the need to protect the environment. As a result, the Companies cannot
now estimate the precise effect of existing and potential regulations and
legislation upon any of their existing and proposed facilities and operations or
upon their ability to issue additional first mortgage bonds under their
respective mortgages. These mortgages contain covenants by the Companies to
observe and conform to all valid governmental requirements at the time
applicable unless in course of contest, and provisions which, in effect, prevent
the issuance of additional bonds if there is a completed default under the
mortgage. The provisions of each of the mortgages, in effect, also require, in
the opinion of counsel for the respective Companies, that certification of
property additions as the basis for the issuance of bonds or other action under
the mortgages be accompanied by an opinion of counsel that the company
certifying such property additions has all governmental permissions at the time
necessary for its then current ownership and operation of such property
additions. The Companies intend to contest any requirements they deem
unreasonable or impossible for compliance or otherwise contrary to the public
interest. Developments in these and other areas of regulation may require the
Companies to modify, supplement or replace equipment and facilities, and may
delay or impede the construction and operation of new facilities, at costs which
could be substantial.

           The effects of compliance on the Companies with regard to
environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on FirstEnergy's
earnings and competitive position. These environmental regulations affect
FirstEnergy's earnings and competitive position to the extent it competes with
companies that are not subject to such regulations and therefore do not bear the
risk of costs associated with compliance, or failure to comply, with such
regulations. FirstEnergy believes it is in material compliance with existing
regulations but is unable to predict whether environmental regulations will
change and what, if any, the effects of such change would be.

Fuel Supply

           The Companies' sources of generation during 2002 were:

                                       Coal             Nuclear
                                       ----             -------

           OE....................      74.5%              25.5%
           Penn..................      34.6%              65.4%
           CEI...................      67.3%              32.7%
           TE....................      61.8%              38.2%
           Total FirstEnergy.....      65.6%              34.4%


           Generation from JCP&L's and Met-Ed's hydro and combustion turbine
generation facilities was minimal in 2002.

           FirstEnergy currently has long-term coal contracts to provide
approximately 12,400,000 tons for the year 2003. The contracts are shared among
the Companies based on various economic considerations. This contract coal







is produced primarily from mines located in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West
Virginia. The contracts expire at various times through December 31, 2019.

           The Companies estimate their 2003 coal requirements to be
approximately 18,860,000 tons (OE - 7,250,000, Penn - 6,000,000, CEI -
4,170,000, and TE - 1,440,000) to be met from the long-term contracts discussed
above and spot market purchases. See "Environmental Matters" for factors
pertaining to meeting environmental regulations affecting coal-fired generating
units.

           FirstEnergy has contracts for uranium material and conversion
services through 2006. The enrichment services are contracted for the majority
of the enrichment requirements for nuclear fuel through 2006. Fabrication
services for fuel assemblies are contracted for the next four reloads for Beaver
Valley Unit 1, the next three reloads for Beaver Valley Unit 2 (through
approximately 2007 and 2006, respectively), the next two reloads for Davis-Besse
(through approximately 2007) and through the operating license period for Perry
(through approximately 2026). In addition to the existing commitments,
FirstEnergy intends to make additional arrangements for the supply of uranium
and for the subsequent conversion, enrichment, fabrication, and waste disposal
services.

           On-site spent fuel storage facilities are expected to be adequate for
Perry through 2011; facilities at Beaver Valley Units 1 and 2 are expected to be
adequate through 2018 and 2009, respectively. With the plant modifications
completed in 2002, Davis-Besse has adequate storage through the remainder of its
operating license period. After current on-site storage capacity is exhausted,
additional storage capacity will have to be obtained either through plant
modifications, interim off-site disposal, or permanent waste disposal
facilities. The Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 provides for the
construction of facilities for the permanent disposal of high-level nuclear
wastes, including spent fuel from nuclear power plants operated by electric
utilities; however, the selection of a suitable site is embroiled in the
political process. FirstEnergy has contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) for the disposal of spent fuel for Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse and Perry.
On February 15, 2002, President Bush approved the DOE's recommendation of Yucca
Mountain for underground disposal of spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power
plants and high level waste from U.S. defense programs. The recommendation by
President Bush enables the process to proceed to the licensing phase. Based on
the DOE schedule published in the July 1999 Draft Environmental Impact
Statement, the Yucca Mountain Repository is currently projected to start
receiving spent fuel in 2010. FirstEnergy intends to make additional
arrangements for storage capacity as a contingency for further delays with the
DOE acceptance of spent fuel for disposal past 2010.

System Capacity and Reserves

           The 2002 net maximum hourly demand for each of the Companies was:
OE-6,757 MW (including an additional 387 MW of firm power sales under a contract
which extends through 2005) on August 1, 2002; Penn-969 MW (including an
additional 63 MW of firm power sales under a contract which extends through
2005) on July 29, 2002; CEI-4,561 MW on August 1, 2002; TE-2,104 MW on July 3,
2002; JCP&L-5,802 MW on August 2, 2002; Met-Ed-2,616 MW on August 14, 2002; and
Penelec-2,693 MW on July 29, 2002. JCP&L's load was auctioned off in the New
Jersey BGS Auction, transferring the full 5,100 MW load obligation to other
parties for the period August 1, 2002 to July 31, 2003. FES participated in the
auction and won a segment of that load.

           Based on existing capacity plans, ongoing arrangements for firm
purchase contracts, and anticipated term power sales and purchases, FirstEnergy
has sufficient supply resources to meet load obligations. The current
FirstEnergy capacity portfolio contains 13,387 MW of owned generation and
approximately 1,600 MW of long-term purchases from non-utility generators.

           Any remaining load obligations will be met through a mix of
multi-year forward purchases, short-term forward purchases (less than one year)
and spot market purchases.

Regional Reliability

           The Companies participate with 24 other electric companies operating
in nine states in ECAR, which was organized for the purpose of furthering the
reliability of bulk power supply in the area through coordination of the
planning and operation by the ECAR members of their bulk power supply
facilities. The ECAR members have established principles and procedures
regarding matters affecting the reliability of the bulk power supply within the
ECAR region. Procedures have been adopted regarding: i) the evaluation and
simulated testing of systems' performance; ii) the establishment of minimum
levels of daily operating reserves; iii) the development of a program regarding
emergency procedures during conditions of declining system frequency; and iv)
the basis for uniform rating of generating equipment.

           Following the FirstEnergy/GPU merger the transmission facilities of
JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec continue to be operated by PJM. PJM is the
organization responsible for the operation and control of the bulk electric
power system throughout major portions of five Mid-Atlantic states and the
District of Columbia. PJM is dedicated to meeting the reliability criteria and
standards of the North American Electric Reliability Council and the
Mid-Atlantic Area Council.




Competition

           The Companies traditionally competed with other utilities for
intersystem bulk power sales and for sales to municipalities and cooperatives.
The Companies compete with suppliers of natural gas and other forms of energy in
connection with their industrial and commercial sales and in the home climate
control market, both with respect to new customers and conversions, and with all
other suppliers of electricity. To date, there has been no substantial
cogeneration by the Companies' customers.

           As a result of the actions taken by state legislative bodies over the
last few years, major changes in the electric utility business are occurring in
parts of the United States, including Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania where
FirstEnergy's utility subsidiaries operate. These changes have resulted in
fundamental alterations in the way traditional integrated utilities and holding
company systems, like FirstEnergy, conduct their business. In accordance with
the Ohio electric utility restructuring law under which Ohio electric customers
could begin choosing their electric generation suppliers starting in January
2001, FirstEnergy has further aligned its business units to accommodate its
retail strategy and participate in the competitive electricity marketplace in
Ohio. The organizational changes deal with the unbundling of electric utility
services and new ways of conducting business.

           Sales of electricity in deregulated markets are diversifying
FirstEnergy's revenue sources through its competitive subsidiaries in areas
outside of the Companies' franchise areas. This strategy has positioned
FirstEnergy to compete in the northeast quadrant of the United States - the
region targeted by FirstEnergy for growth. FirstEnergy's competitive
subsidiaries are actively participating in deregulated energy markets in Ohio,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Michigan. Currently, FES is
providing electric generation service to customers within those states. As
additional states within the northeast region of the United States become
deregulated, FES is preparing to enter these markets.

           Competition in Ohio's electric generation began on January 1, 2001.
FirstEnergy moved the operation of the generation portion of its business to its
competitive business unit as reflected in its approved Ohio transition plan. The
Companies continue to provide generation services to regulated franchise
customers who have not chosen an alternative, competitive generation supplier,
except in New Jersey where JCP&L's obligation to provide BGS has been removed
through a transitional mechanism of auctioning the obligation (see "NJBPU Rate
Matters"). In September 2002, Met-Ed and Penelec assigned their PLR
responsibility to FES through a wholesale power sale agreement. Under the
agreement terms, FES assumes the supply obligation and the energy supply profit
and loss risk for the portion of power supply requirements not self-supplied by
Met-Ed and Penelec. The agreement is automatically extended on an annual basis
unless any party elects to cancel the agreement by November 1 of the preceding
year (see "PPUC Rate Matters" for further discussion). The Ohio Companies and
Penn obtain their generation through power supply agreements with FES. In
addition to electric generation, FES is also competing in deregulated natural
gas markets as well as offering other energy-related products and services.

Research and Development

           The Companies participate in funding the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI), which was formed for the purpose of expanding electric
research and development under the voluntary sponsorship of the nation's
electric utility industry - public, private and cooperative. Its goal is to
mutually benefit utilities and their customers by promoting the development of
new and improved technologies to help the utility industry meet present and
future electric energy needs in environmentally and economically acceptable
ways. EPRI conducts research on all aspects of electric power production and
use, including fuels, generation, delivery, energy management and conservation,
environmental effects and energy analysis. The major portion of EPRI research
and development projects is directed toward practical solutions and their
applications to problems currently facing the electric utility industry. In
2002, approximately 69% of the Companies' research and development expenditures
were related to EPRI.





Executive Officers

           The executive officers are elected at the annual organization meeting
of the Board of Directors, held immediately after the annual meeting of
stockholders, and hold office until the next such organization meeting, unless
the Board of Directors shall otherwise determine, or unless a resignation is
submitted.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

           The Companies' respective first mortgage indentures constitute, in
the opinion of the Companies' counsel, direct first liens on substantially all
of the respective Companies' physical property, subject only to excepted
encumbrances, as defined in the indentures. See "Leases" and "Capitalization"
notes to the respective financial statements for information concerning leases
and financing encumbrances affecting certain of the Companies' properties.

           The Companies own, individually or together as tenants in common,
and/or lease, the generating units in service as of March 1, 2003, shown on the
table below.




           Prolonged outages of existing generating units might make it
necessary for the Companies, depending upon the demand for electric service upon
their system, to use to a greater extent than otherwise, less efficient and less
economic generating units, or purchased power, and in some cases may require the
reduction of load during peak periods under the Companies' interruptible
programs, all to an extent not presently determinable.

           The Companies' generating plants and load centers are connected by a
transmission system consisting of elements having various voltage ratings
ranging from 23 kV to 345 kV. The Companies' overhead and underground
transmission lines aggregate 14,941 pole miles.

           The Companies' electric distribution systems include 111,704 miles of
overhead pole line and underground conduit carrying primary, secondary and
street lighting circuits. They own substations with a total installed
transformer capacity of 86,334,000 kilovolt-amperes.




           FirstEnergy's transmission facilities that are owned and operated by
ATSI also interconnect with those of AEP, DPL, Duquesne, Allegheny, MEC and
Penelec. The transmission facilities of JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec are physically
interconnected and are operated on an integrated basis as part of the PJM RTO.
