      Note 16, Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements contained in Item 8 for information regarding FirstEnergy's
      reportable segments.

Generation
      Asset Transfers

In 2005, the Ohio Companies and Penn entered into certain agreements
      implementing a series of intra-system generation asset transfers that were
      completed in the fourth quarter of 2005. The asset transfers resulted in the
      respective undivided ownership interests of the Ohio Companies and Penn in
      FirstEnergy's nuclear and non-nuclear generation assets being owned by NGC
      and
      FGCO, respectively. The generating plant interests transferred do not include
      leasehold interests of CEI, TE and OE in certain of the plants that are
      currently subject to sale and leaseback arrangements with non-affiliates.

On October 24, 2005, the Ohio Companies and Penn completed the intra-system
      transfer of non-nuclear generation assets to FGCO. Prior to the transfer, FGCO,
      as lessee under a Master Facility Lease with the Ohio Companies and Penn,
      leased, operated and maintained the non-nuclear generation assets that it now
      owns. The asset transfers were consummated pursuant to FGCO's purchase option
      under the Master Facility Lease.

On December 16, 2005, the Ohio Companies and Penn completed the intra-system
      transfer of their respective ownership in the nuclear generation assets to
      NGC
      through, in the case of OE and Penn, an asset spin-off by way of dividend and,
      in the case of CEI and TE, a sale at net book value.

On December 28, 2006, the NRC approved the transfer of ownership in NGC
      from FirstEnergy to FES. Effective December 31, 2006, NGC became a wholly
      owned subsidiary of FES and second tier subsidiary of FirstEnergy. FENOC
      continues to operate and maintain the nuclear generation assets.

These transactions were pursuant to the Ohio Companies' and Penn's restructuring
      plans that were approved by the PUCO and the PPUC, respectively, under
      applicable Ohio and Pennsylvania electric utility restructuring legislation.
      Consistent with the restructuring plans, generation assets that had been owned
      by the Ohio Companies and Penn were required to be separated from the regulated
      delivery business of those companies through transfer to a separate corporate
      entity. The transactions essentially completed the divestitures contemplated
      by
      the restructuring plans by transferring the ownership interests to NGC and
      FGCO
      without impacting the operation of the plants.

Divestitures

In 2006, FirstEnergy sold its remaining FSG subsidiaries (Roth Bros.,
      Hattenbach, Dunbar, Edwards and RPC) for an aggregate net after-tax gain of
      $2.2 million. Based on SFAS 144, Hattenbach, Dunbar, Edwards, and RPC are
      accounted for as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2006. Roth Bros.
      did
      not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations as of
      December 31, 2006.

In
      March 2006,
      FirstEnergy sold 60% of its interest in MYR for an after-tax gain of $0.2
      million. In June 2006, as part of the March 2006 agreement, FirstEnergy sold
      an
      additional 1.67% interest. As a result of the March sale, FirstEnergy
      deconsolidated MYR in the first quarter of 2006 and accounted for its remaining
      interest under the equity method. In November 2006, FirstEnergy sold the
      remaining 38.33% interest in MYR for an after-tax gain of $8.6 million. In
      accordance with SFAS 144, the income for the time period that MYR was accounted
      for as an equity method investment has not been included in discontinued
      operations; however, results for all reporting periods prior to the initial
      sale
      in March 2006, including the portion of 2006 prior to the sale are reported
      as
      discontinued operations.

Utility
      Regulation

On
      August 8, 2005 President Bush signed into law the EPACT. The EPACT repealed
      PUHCA effective February 2006. PUHCA imposed financial and operational
      restrictions on many aspects of FirstEnergy's business. Some of PUHCA's consumer
      protection authority was transferred to the FERC and state utility commissions.
      The EPACT also provides for tax credits for the development of certain clean
      coal and emissions technologies.


Each
      of the
      Companies' retail rates, conditions of service, issuance of securities and
      other
      matters are also subject to regulation in the state in which each operates
      -
      Ohio by the PUCO, New Jersey by the NJBPU and in Pennsylvania by the PPUC.
      With
      respect to their wholesale and interstate electric operations and rates, the
      Companies are subject to regulation, including regulation of their accounting
      policies and practices, by the FERC. Under Ohio law, municipalities may regulate
      rates, subject to appeal to the PUCO if not acceptable to the
      utility.

Regulatory
      Accounting

The
      Companies and
      ATSI recognize, as regulatory assets, costs which the FERC, PUCO, PPUC and
      NJBPU
      have authorized for recovery from customers in future periods or for which
      authorization is probable. Without the probability of such authorization, costs
      currently recorded as regulatory assets would have been charged to income as
      incurred. All regulatory assets are expected to be recovered from customers
      under the Companies' respective transition and regulatory plans. Based on those
      plans, the Companies continue to bill and collect cost-based rates for their
      transmission and distribution services, which remain regulated; accordingly,
      it
      is appropriate that the Companies continue the application of SFAS 71 to
      those operations.

FirstEnergy
      accounts
      for the effects of regulation through the application of SFAS 71 to its
      operating utilities since their rates:

·

are
                established by a third-party regulator with the authority to set
                rates
                that bind customers;

·

are
                cost-based; and

·

can
                be charged
                to and collected from customers.

An enterprise meeting all of these criteria capitalizes costs that would
      otherwise be charged to expense if the rate actions of its regulator make it
      probable that those costs will be recovered in future revenue. SFAS 71 is
      applied only to the parts of the business that meet the above criteria. If
      a
      portion of the business applying SFAS 71 no longer meets those
      requirements, previously recorded net regulatory assets are removed from the
      balance sheet in accordance with the guidance in SFAS 101.

In Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, laws applicable to electric industry
      restructuring contain similar provisions that are reflected in the Companies'
      respective state regulatory plans. These provisions include:

·

restructuring
                the electric generation business and allowing the Companies' customers
                to
                select a competitive electric generation supplier other than the
                Companies;

·

establishing
                or defining the PLR obligations to customers in the Companies' service
                areas;

·

providing
                the
                Companies with the opportunity to recover potentially stranded investment
                (or transition costs) not otherwise recoverable in a competitive
                generation market;

·

itemizing
                (unbundling) the price of electricity into its component elements
                -
                including generation, transmission, distribution and stranded costs
                recovery charges;

·

continuing
                regulation of the Companies' transmission and distribution systems;
                and

·

requiring
                corporate separation of regulated and unregulated business
                activities.

Reliability
      Initiatives

In late 2003 and early 2004, a series of letters, reports and recommendations
      were issued from various entities, including governmental, industry and ad
      hoc
      reliability entities (PUCO, FERC, NERC and the U.S. - Canada Power System Outage
      Task Force) regarding enhancements to regional reliability. In 2004, FirstEnergy
      completed implementation of all actions and initiatives related to enhancing
      area reliability, improving voltage and reactive management, operator readiness
      and training and emergency response preparedness recommended for completion
      in
      2004. On July 14, 2004, NERC independently verified that FirstEnergy had
      implemented the various initiatives to be completed by June 30 or summer
      2004, with minor exceptions noted by FirstEnergy, which exceptions are now
      essentially complete. FirstEnergy is proceeding with the implementation of
      the
      recommendations that were to be completed subsequent to 2004 and will continue
      to periodically assess the FERC-ordered Reliability Study recommendations for
      forecasted 2009 system conditions, recognizing revised load forecasts and other
      changing system conditions which may impact the recommendations. Thus far,
      implementation of the recommendations has not required, nor is expected to
      require, substantial investment in new equipment or material upgrades to
      existing equipment. The FERC or other applicable government agencies and
      reliability entities may, however, take a different view as to recommended
      enhancements or may recommend additional enhancements in the future, which
      could
      require additional, material expenditures.


As
      a result of
      outages experienced in JCP&L's service area in 2002 and 2003, the NJBPU had
      implemented reviews into JCP&L's service reliability. In 2004, the NJBPU
      adopted an MOU that set out specific tasks related to service reliability to
      be
      performed by JCP&L and a timetable for completion and endorsed JCP&L's
      ongoing actions to implement the MOU. On June 9, 2004, the NJBPU approved a
      Stipulation that incorporates the final report of an SRM who made
      recommendations on appropriate courses of action necessary to ensure system-wide
      reliability. The Stipulation also incorporates the Executive Summary and
      Recommendation portions of the final report of a focused audit of JCP&L's
      Planning and Operations and Maintenance programs and practices (Focused Audit).
      On February 11, 2005, JCP&L met with the DRA to discuss reliability
      improvements. The SRM completed his work and issued his final report to the
      NJBPU on June 1, 2006. JCP&L filed a comprehensive response to the NJBPU on
      July 14, 2006. JCP&L continues to file compliance reports reflecting
      activities associated with the MOU and Stipulation.

The
      EPACT provides
      for the creation of an ERO to establish and enforce reliability standards for
      the bulk power system, subject to FERC's review. On February 3, 2006, the
      FERC adopted a rule establishing certification requirements for the ERO, as
      well
      as regional entities envisioned to assume compliance monitoring and enforcement
      responsibility for the new reliability standards. The FERC issued an order
      on
      rehearing on March 30, 2006, providing certain clarifications and
      essentially affirming the rule.

The NERC has been preparing the implementation aspects of reorganizing its
      structure to meet the FERC's certification requirements for the ERO. The NERC
      made a filing with the FERC on April 4, 2006 to obtain certification as the
      ERO and to obtain FERC approval of pro forma delegation agreements with regional
      reliability organizations (regional entities). The new FERC rule referred to
      above, further provides for reorganizing regional entities that would replace
      the current regional councils and for rearranging their relationship with the
      ERO. The "regional entity" may be delegated authority by the ERO, subject to
      FERC approval, for compliance and enforcement of reliability standards adopted
      by the ERO and approved by the FERC. The ERO filing was noticed on April 7,
      and comments and reply comments were filed in May, June and July 2006. On July
      20, 2006, the FERC certified the NERC as the ERO to implement the provisions
      of
      Section 215 of the Federal Power Act and directed the NERC to make compliance
      filings addressing governance and non-governance issues and the regional
      delegation agreements. On September 18, 2006 and October 18, 2006, NERC
      submitted compliance filings addressing the governance and non-governance issues
      identified in the FERC ERO Certification Order, dated July 20, 2006. On October
      30, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting most of NERC's governance filings.
      On January 18, 2007, the FERC issued an order largely accepting NERC's
      compliance filings addressing non-governance issues, subject to an additional
      compliance filing requirement.

On
      April 4, 2006,
      NERC also submitted a filing with the FERC seeking approval of mandatory
      reliability standards, as well as for approval with the relevant Canadian
      authorities. These reliability standards are based, with some modifications
      and
      additions, on the current NERC Version 0 reliability standards. The reliability
      standards filing was subsequently evaluated by the FERC on May 11, 2006, leading
      to the FERC staff's release of a preliminary assessment that cited many
      deficiencies in the proposed reliability standards. The NERC and industry
      participants filed comments in response to the Staff's preliminary assessment.
      The FERC held a technical conference on the proposed reliability standards
      on
      July 6, 2006. The FERC issued a NOPR on the proposed reliability standards
      on
      October 20, 2006. In the NOPR, the FERC proposed to approve 83 of the 107
      reliability standards and directed NERC to make technical improvements to 62
      of
      the 83 standards approved. The 24 standards that were not approved remain
      pending at the FERC awaiting further clarification and filings by the NERC
      and
      regional entities. The FERC also provided additional clarification within the
      NOPR regarding the proposed application of final standards and guidance with
      regard to technical improvements of the standards. On November 15, 2006, NERC
      submitted several revised reliability standards and three new proposed
      reliability standards. Interested parties were provided the opportunity to
      comment on the NOPR (including the revised standards submitted by NERC in
      November) by January 3, 2007. Numerous parties, including FirstEnergy, filed
      comments on the NOPR on January 3, 2007. Mandatory reliability standards
      enforceable with penalties are expected to be in place by the summer of 2007.
      In
      a separate order issued October 24, 2006, the FERC approved NERC's 2007
      budget and business plan subject to certain compliance filings.

On
      November 29, 2006, NERC submitted an additional compliance filing with the
      FERC
      regarding the Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement Program (CMEP) along with
      the proposed Delegation Agreements between the ERO and the regional reliability
      entities. The FERC provided opportunity for interested parties to comment on
      the
      CMEP by January 10, 2007. We, as well as other parties, moved to intervene
      and
      submitted responsive comments on January 10, 2007. This filing is pending before
      the FERC.

The ECAR, Mid-Atlantic Area Council, and Mid-American Interconnected Network
      reliability councils completed the consolidation of these regions into a single
      new regional reliability organization known as Reliability

First

Corporation.
      Reliability

First

began operations as
      a regional reliability council under NERC on January 1, 2006 and on
      November 29, 2006 filed a proposed Delegation Agreement with NERC to obtain
      certification consistent with the final rule as a "regional entity" under the
      ERO. All of FirstEnergy's facilities are located within the
      Reliability

First

region.


On May 2, 2006, the NERC Board of Trustees adopted eight new cyber security
      standards that replaced interim standards put in place in the wake of the
      September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and thirteen additional reliability
      standards. The security standards became effective on June 1, 2006, and the
      remaining standards will become effective throughout 2006 and 2007. NERC filed
      these proposed standards with the FERC and relevant Canadian authorities for
      approval. The cyber security standards were not included in the October 20,
      2006 NOPR and are being addressed in a separate FERC docket. On
      December 11, 2006, the FERC Staff provided its preliminary assessment of
      these proposed mandatory reliability standards and again cited various
      deficiencies in the proposed standards, providing interested parties with the
      opportunity to comment on the assessment by February 12, 2007.

FirstEnergy believes it is in compliance with all current NERC reliability
      standards. However, based upon a review of the October 20, 2006 NOPR, it
      appears that the FERC will adopt more strict reliability standards than those
      contained in the current NERC standards. The financial impact of complying
      with
      the new standards cannot be determined at this time. However, the EPACT required
      that all prudent costs incurred to comply with the new reliability standards
      be
      recovered in rates.

PUCO
      Rate
      Matters

On October 21, 2003, the Ohio Companies filed their RSP case with the PUCO.
      On
      August 5, 2004, the Ohio Companies accepted the RSP as modified and approved
      by
      the PUCO in an August 4, 2004 Entry on Rehearing, subject to a CBP. The RSP
      was
      intended to establish generation service rates beginning January 1, 2006, in
      response to the PUCO's concerns about price and supply uncertainty following
      the
      end of the Ohio Companies' transition plan market development period. On May
      3,
      2006, the Supreme Court of Ohio issued an opinion affirming the PUCO's order
      in
      all respects, except it remanded back to the PUCO the matter of ensuring the
      availability of sufficient means for customer participation in the marketplace.
      The RSP contained a provision that permitted the Ohio Companies to withdraw
      and
      terminate the RSP in the event that the PUCO, or the Supreme Court of Ohio,
      rejected all or part of the RSP. In such event, the Ohio Companies have 30
      days
      from the final order or decision to provide notice of termination. On July
      20,
      2006 the Ohio Companies filed with the PUCO a Request to Initiate a Proceeding
      on Remand. In their Request, the Ohio Companies provided notice of termination
      to those provisions of the RSP subject to termination, subject to being
      withdrawn, and also set forth a framework for addressing the Supreme Court
      of
      Ohio's findings on customer participation. If the PUCO approves a resolution
      to
      the issues raised by the Supreme Court of Ohio that is acceptable to the Ohio
      Companies, the Ohio Companies' termination will be withdrawn and considered
      to
      be null and void. On July 26, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry directing the
      Ohio
      Companies to file a plan in a new docket to address the Court's concern. The
      Ohio Companies filed their RSP Remand CBP on September 29, 2006. Initial
      comments were filed on January 12, 2007 and reply comments were filed on
      January 29

,
      2007.
      I

n
      their reply comments the Ohio Companies described the highlights of a new tariff
      offering they would be willing to make available to customers that would allow
      customers to purchase renewable energy certificates associated with a renewable
      generation source, subject to PUCO approval.

No further
      proceedings are scheduled at this time.

The Ohio Companies filed an application and stipulation with the PUCO on
      September 9, 2005 seeking approval of the RCP, a supplement to the RSP. On
      November 4, 2005, the Ohio Companies filed a supplemental stipulation with
      the
      PUCO, which constituted an additional component of the RCP filed on September
      9,
      2005. Major provisions of the RCP include:


On January 4, 2006, the PUCO approved, with modifications, the Ohio Companies'
      RCP to supplement the RSP to provide customers with more certain rate levels
      than otherwise available under the RSP during the plan period.

On
      January 10,
      2006, the Ohio Companies filed a Motion for Clarification seeking clarity on
      a
      number of issues. On January 25, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry on
      Rehearing granting in part, and denying in part, the Ohio Companies' previous
      requests and clarifying issues referred to above. The PUCO granted the Ohio
      Companies' requests to:

The PUCO approved the Ohio Companies' methodology for determining distribution
      deferral amounts, but denied the Motion in that the PUCO Staff must verify
      the
      level of distribution expenditures contained in current rates, as opposed to
      simply accepting the amounts contained in the Ohio Companies' Motion. On
      February 3, 2006, several other parties filed applications for rehearing,
      which the PUCO denied on March 1, 2006. Two of these parties subsequently filed
      notices of appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio. The Ohio Supreme Court
      scheduled this case for oral argument on February 27, 2007. On January 31,
      2007,
      the Ohio Companies filed a stipulation which, among other matters and subject
      to
      PUCO approval, affirmed that the supplemental stipulation in the RCP would
      be
      implemented. This stipulation was approved by the PUCO on February 14, 2007.

On December 30, 2004, the Ohio Companies filed with the PUCO two
      applications related to the recovery of transmission and ancillary service
      related costs. The first application sought recovery of these costs beginning
      January 1, 2006. The Ohio Companies requested that these costs be recovered
      through a rider that would be effective on January 1, 2006 and adjusted
      each July 1 thereafter. The parties reached a settlement agreement that was
      approved by the PUCO on August 31, 2005. The incremental transmission and
      ancillary service revenues recovered from January 1 through June 30,
      2006 were approximately $54 million. That amount included the recovery of a
      portion of the 2005 deferred MISO expenses as described below. On April 27,
      2006, the Ohio Companies filed the annual update rider to determine revenues
      ($124 million) from July 2006 through June 2007. The filed rider went into
      effect on July 1, 2006.

The
      second
      application sought authority to defer costs associated with transmission and
      ancillary service related costs incurred during the period October 1, 2003
      through December 31, 2005. On May 18, 2005, the PUCO granted the
      accounting authority for the Ohio Companies to defer incremental transmission
      and ancillary service-related charges incurred as a participant in MISO, but
      only for those costs incurred during the period December 30, 2004 through
      December 31, 2005. Permission to defer costs incurred prior to
      December 30, 2004 was denied. The PUCO also authorized the Ohio Companies
      to accrue carrying charges on the deferred balances. On August 31, 2005,
      the OCC appealed the PUCO's decision.

On
      January 20,
      2006, the OCC sought rehearing of the PUCO's approval of the recovery of
      deferred costs through the rider during the period January 1, 2006 through
      June 30, 2006. The PUCO denied the OCC's application on February 6,
      2006. On March 23, 2006, the OCC appealed the PUCO's order to the Ohio
      Supreme Court. On March 27, 2006, the OCC filed a motion to consolidate
      this appeal with the deferral appeals discussed above and to postpone oral
      arguments in the deferral appeal until after all briefs are filed in this most
      recent appeal of the rider recovery mechanism.

On
      March 20, 2006,
      the Ohio Supreme Court, on its own motion, consolidated the OCC's appeal of
      the
      Ohio Companies' case with a similar case involving Dayton Power & Light
      Company. Oral arguments were heard on May 10, 2006. On November 29,
      2006, the Ohio Supreme Court issued its opinion upholding the PUCO's
      determination that the Ohio Companies may defer transmission and ancillary
      service related costs incurred on and after December 30, 2004. The Ohio
      Supreme Court also determined that the PUCO erred when it denied the OCC
      intervention, but further ruled that such error did not prejudice OCC and,
      therefore, the Ohio Supreme Court did not reverse or remand the PUCO on this
      ground. The Ohio Supreme Court also determined that the OCC's appeal was not
      premature. No party filed a motion for reconsideration with the Ohio Supreme
      Court.

PPUC
      Rate
      Matters

A February 2002 Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania decision affirmed the June
      2001 PPUC decision regarding approval of the FirstEnergy/GPU merger, remanded
      the issues of quantification and allocation of merger savings to the PPUC and
      denied Met-Ed and Penelec the rate relief initially approved in the PPUC
      decision. On May 4, 2006, the PPUC consolidated the merger savings
      proceeding with the April 10, 2006 comprehensive rate filing proceeding
      discussed below. On January 11, 2007, the PPUC entered an order in that rate
      filing proceeding and determined that no merger savings from prior years should
      be considered in determining customers' rates.


On January 12, 2005, Met-Ed and Penelec filed, before the PPUC, a request for
      deferral of transmission-related costs beginning January 1, 2005. Met-Ed and
      Penelec sought to consolidate this proceeding (and modified their request to
      provide deferral of 2006 transmission-related costs only) with the comprehensive
      rate filing made on April 10, 2006, described below. On May 4, 2006, the PPUC
      approved the modified request.

Met-Ed and Penelec have been purchasing a portion of their PLR requirements
      from
      FES through a partial requirements wholesale power sales agreement and various
      amendments. Under these agreements, FES retained the supply obligation and
      the
      supply profit and loss risk for the portion of power supply requirements not
      self-supplied by Met-Ed and Penelec. The FES agreements have reduced Met-Ed's
      and Penelec's exposure to high wholesale power prices by providing power at
      a
      fixed price for their uncommitted PLR capacity and energy costs during the
      term
      of these agreements with FES.

On April 7, 2006, the parties entered into a Tolling Agreement that arose
      from FES' notice to Met-Ed and Penelec that FES elected to exercise its right
      to
      terminate the partial requirements agreement effective midnight
      December 31, 2006. On November 29, 2006, Met-Ed, Penelec and FES
      agreed to suspend the April 7 Tolling Agreement pending resolution of the PPUC's
      proceedings regarding the Met-Ed and Penelec Transition Rate cases filed April
      10, 2006, described below. Separately, on September 26, 2006, Met-Ed and
      Penelec successfully conducted a competitive RFP for a portion of their PLR
      obligation for the period December 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008.
      FES was one of the successful bidders in that RFP process and on September
      26,
      2006 entered into a Supplier Master Agreement to supply a certain portion of
      Met-Ed's and Penelec's PLR requirements at market prices that substantially
      exceed the fixed price in the partial requirements agreements.

Based on the outcome of the Transition Rate filing, as described below, Met-Ed,
      Penelec and FES agreed to restate the partial requirements power sales agreement
      effective January 1, 2007. The restated agreement incorporates the same fixed
      price for residual capacity and energy supplied by FES as in the prior
      arrangements between the parties, and automatically extends for successive
      one
      year terms unless any party gives 60 days' notice prior to the end of the year.
      The restated agreement allows Met-Ed and Penelec to sell the output of NUG
      generation to the market and requires FES to provide energy at fixed prices
      to
      replace any NUG energy thus sold to the extent needed for Met-Ed and Penelec
      to
      satisfy their PLR obligations. The parties have also separately terminated
      the
      Tolling, Suspension and Supplier Master agreements in connection with the
      restatement of the partial requirements agreement. Accordingly, the energy
      that
      would have been supplied under the Master Supplier Agreement will now be
      provided under the restated partial requirements agreement.

If
      Met-Ed and Penelec were to replace the entire FES supply at current market
      power
      prices without corresponding regulatory authorization to increase their
      generation prices to customers, each company would likely incur a significant
      increase in operating expenses and experience a material deterioration in credit
      quality metrics. Under such a scenario, each company's credit profile would
      no
      longer be expected to support an investment grade rating for its fixed income
      securities. Based on the PPUC's January 11, 2007 order described below, if
      FES
      ultimately determines to terminate, reduce, or significantly modify the
      agreement prior to the expiration of Met-Ed's and Penelec's generation rate
      caps
      in 2010, timely regulatory relief is not likely to be granted by the PPUC.

Met-Ed
      and Penelec
      made a comprehensive rate filing with the PPUC on April 10, 2006 to address
      a number of transmission, distribution and supply issues. If Met-Ed's and
      Penelec's preferred approach involving accounting deferrals was approved, the
      filing would have increased annual revenues by $216 million and
      $157 million, respectively. That filing included, among other things, a
      request to charge customers for an increasing amount of market priced power
      procured through a CBP as the amount of supply provided under the then existing
      FES agreement is phased out in accordance with the April 7, 2006 Tolling
      Agreement described above.

Met-Ed
      and Penelec
      also requested approval of the January 12, 2005 petition for the deferral
      of transmission-related costs discussed above, but only for those costs incurred
      during 2006. In this rate filing, Met-Ed and Penelec also requested recovery
      of
      annual transmission and related costs incurred on or after January 1, 2007,
      plus the amortized portion of 2006 costs over a ten-year period, along with
      applicable carrying charges, through an adjustable rider similar to that
      implemented in Ohio.

Changes in the
      recovery of NUG expenses and the recovery of Met-Ed's non-NUG stranded costs
      were also included in the filing. Hearings were held in late August 2006 and
      briefing occurred in September and October. The ALJs issued their Recommended
      Decision on November 2, 2006.


The
      PPUC entered its Opinion and Order in the rate filing proceeding on January
      11,
      2007. The Order approved the recovery of transmission costs, including the
      deferral, and determined that no merger savings from prior years should be
      considered in determining customers' rates. The request for increases in
      generation supply rates was denied as were the requested changes in NUG expense
      recovery and Met-Ed's non-NUG stranded costs. The order decreased Met-Ed's
      and
      Penelec's distribution rates by $80 million and $19 million,
      respectively. These decreases were offset by the increases allowed for the
      recovery of transmission expenses and the 2006 transmission deferral. Overall
      rates increased by 5.0% for Met-Ed ($59 million) and 4.5% for Penelec
      ($50 million). Met-Ed and Penelec filed a Petition for Reconsideration on
      January 26, 2007 on the issues of consolidated tax savings and rate of return
      on
      equity. Other parties filed Petitions for Reconsideration on transmission
      congestion, transmission deferrals and rate design issues. The PPUC on February
      8, 2007 entered an order granting Met-Ed's, Penelec's and the other parties'
      petitions for procedural purposes. Due to that ruling, the period for appeals
      to
      the Commonwealth Court is tolled until 30 days after the PPUC enters a
      subsequent order ruling on the substantive issues raised in the
      petitions.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, Met-Ed's and Penelec's regulatory deferrals pursuant to
      the 1998 Restructuring Settlement (including the Phase 2 Proceedings) and the
      FirstEnergy/GPU Merger Settlement Stipulation were $303 million and
      $70 million, respectively. Penelec's $70 million deferral is subject
      to final resolution of an IRS settlement associated with NUG trust fund
      proceeds. During the PPUC's annual audit of Met-Ed's and Penelec's NUG stranded
      cost balances in 2006, it noted a modification to the NUG purchased power
      stranded cost accounting methodology made by Met-Ed and Penelec. On August
      18,
      2006, a PPUC Order was entered requiring Met-Ed and Penelec to reflect the
      deferred NUG cost balances as if the stranded cost accounting methodology
      modification had not been implemented. As a result of the PPUC's Order, Met-Ed
      recognized a pre-tax charge of approximately $10.3 million in the third quarter
      of 2006, representing incremental costs deferred under the revised methodology
      in 2005. Met-Ed and Penelec continue to believe that the stranded cost
      accounting methodology modification is appropriate and on August 24, 2006 filed
      a petition with the PPUC pursuant to its Order for authorization to reflect
      the
      stranded cost accounting methodology modification effective January 1, 1999.
      Hearings on this petition are scheduled for late February 2007. It is not known
      when the PPUC may issue a final decision in this matter.

On
        February 1, 2007
        the Governor of Pennsylvania proposed an Energy Independence Strategy (EIS).
        The
        EIS includes four pieces of preliminary draft legislation that, according
        to the
        Governor, is designed to reduce energy costs, promote energy independence
        and
        stimulate the economy. Elements of the EIS include the installation of smart
        meters, funding for solar panels on residences and small businesses,
        conservation programs to meet demand growth, a requirement that electric
        distribution companies acquire power through a "Least Cost Portfolio", the
        utilization of micro-grids and a three year phase-in of rate increases. Since
        the EIS has only recently been proposed, the final form of any legislation
        is
        uncertain. Consequently, FirstEnergy is unable to predict what impact, if
        any,
        such legislation may have on its operations.

NJBPU
      Rate
      Matters

JCP&L is permitted to defer for future collection from customers the amounts
      by which its costs of supplying BGS to non-shopping customers and costs incurred
      under NUG agreements exceed amounts collected through BGS and NUGC rates and
      market sales of NUG energy and capacity. As of December 31, 2006, the
      accumulated deferred cost balance totaled approximately $369 million. New
      Jersey law allows for securitization of JCP&L's deferred balance upon
      application by JCP&L and a determination by the NJBPU that the conditions of
      the New Jersey restructuring legislation are met. On February 14, 2003,
      JCP&L filed for approval to securitize the July 31, 2003 deferred balance.
      On June 8, 2006, the NJBPU approved JCP&L's request to issue securitization
      bonds associated with BGS stranded cost deferrals. On August 10, 2006,
      JCP&L Transition Funding II, a wholly owned subsidiary of JCP&L, issued
      $182 million of transition bonds with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5%.

On
      December 2,
      2005, JCP&L filed its request for recovery of $165 million of actual
      above-market NUG costs incurred from August 1, 2003 through
      October 31, 2005 and forecasted above-market NUG costs for November and
      December 2005. On February 23, 2006, JCP&L filed updated data reflecting
      actual amounts through December 31, 2005 of $154 million of costs
      incurred since July 31, 2003. On July 18, 2006, JCP&L further
      requested an additional $14 million of costs that had been eliminated from
      the securitized amount. A Stipulation of Settlement was signed by all parties,
      approved by the ALJ and adopted by the NJBPU in its Order dated December 6,
      2006. The Order approves an annual $110 million increase in NUGC rates
      designed to recover deferred costs incurred since August 1, 2003, and a
      portion of costs incurred prior to August 1, 2003 that were not
      securitized. The Order requires that JCP&L absorb any net annual operating
      losses associated with the Forked River Generating Station. In the Settlement,
      JCP&L also agreed not to seek an increase to the NUGC to become effective
      before January 2010, unless the deferred balance exceeds $350 million any
      time after June 30, 2007.


Reacting
      to the
      higher closing prices of the 2006 BGS fixed rate auction, the NJBPU, on
      March 16, 2006, initiated a generic proceeding to evaluate the auction
      process and potential options for the future. On April 6, 2006, initial
      comments were submitted. A public meeting was held on April 21, 2006 and a
      legislative-type hearing was held on April 28, 2006. On June 21, 2006, the
      NJBPU approved the continued use of a descending block auction for the Fixed
      Price Residential Class. JCP&L filed its 2007 BGS company specific addendum
      on July 10, 2006. On October 27, 2006, the NJBPU approved the auction
      format to procure the 2007 Commercial Industrial Energy Price as well as the
      specific rules for both the Fixed Price and Commercial Industrial Energy Price
      auctions. These rules were essentially unchanged from the prior
      auctions.

In accordance with an April 28, 2004 NJBPU order, JCP&L filed testimony
      on June 7, 2004 supporting a continuation of the current level and duration
      of the funding of TMI-2 decommissioning costs by New Jersey customers without
      a
      reduction, termination or capping of the funding. On September 30, 2004,
      JCP&L filed an updated TMI-2 decommissioning study. This study resulted in
      an updated total decommissioning cost estimate of $729 million (in 2003
      dollars) compared to the estimated $528 million (in 2003 dollars) from the
      prior
      1995 decommissioning study. The DRA filed comments on February 28, 2005
      requesting that decommissioning funding be suspended. On March 18, 2005,
      JCP&L filed a response to the Ratepayer Advocate's comments. A schedule for
      further NJBPU proceedings has not yet been set.

On August 1, 2005, the NJBPU established a proceeding to determine whether
      additional ratepayer protections are required at the state level in light of
      the
      repeal of PUHCA pursuant to the EPACT. The NJBPU approved regulations effective
      October 2, 2006 that would prevent a holding company that owns a gas or electric
      public utility from investing more than 25% of the combined assets of its
      utility and utility-related subsidiaries into businesses unrelated to the
      utility industry. These regulations are not expected to materially impact
      FirstEnergy or JCP&L. Also, in the same proceeding, the NJBPU Staff issued
      an additional draft proposal on March 31, 2006 addressing various issues
      including access to books and records, ring-fencing, cross subsidization,
      corporate governance and related matters. With the approval of the NJBPU Staff,
      the affected utilities jointly submitted an alternative proposal on June 1,
      2006. Comments on the alternative proposal were submitted on June 15, 2006.
      On November 3, 2006, the NJPBU Staff circulated a revised draft proposal to
      interested stakeholders.

New Jersey statutes require that the state periodically undertake a planning
      process, known as the Energy Master Plan (EMP), to address energy related issues
      including energy security, economic growth, and environmental impact. The EMP
      is
      to be developed with involvement of the Governor's Office and the Governor's
      Office of Economic Growth, and is to be prepared by a Master Plan Committee,
      which is chaired by the NJBPU President and includes representatives of several
      State departments.

In
      October 2006 the current EMP process was initiated with the issuance of a
      proposed set of objectives which, as to electricity, included the
      following:

·

Reduce
      the total
      projected electricity demand by 20% by 2020;

·

Meet
          22.5% of the State's electricity needs with renewable energy resources
          by that
          date;

·

Reduce
        air pollution
        related to energy use;

·

Encourage
        and
        maintain economic growth and development;

·

Achieve a 20% reduction in both Customer Average Interruption Duration
                Index and System Average Interruption Frequency Index by
                2020;

·

Unit prices for electricity should remain no more than +5% of the
                regional
                average price (region includes New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
                Delaware, Maryland

and the District of Columbia); and

·

Eliminate
      transmission congestion by 2020.

Comments on the objectives and participation in the development of the EMP
      have
      been solicited and a number of working groups have been formed to attain input
      from a broad range of interested stakeholders including utilities, environmental
      groups, customer groups, and major customers. Public stakeholder meetings were
      held in the fall of 2006 and in early 2007, and further public meetings are
      expected in the summer of 2007. A final draft of the EMP is expected to be
      presented to the Governor in the fall of 2007 with further public hearings
      anticipated in early 2008. At this time FirstEnergy cannot predict the outcome
      of this process nor determine its impact.


FERC
      Rate
      Matters

On
      March 28, 2006,
      ATSI and MISO filed with the FERC a request to modify ATSI's Attachment O
      formula rate to include revenue requirements associated with recovery of
      deferred Vegetation Management Enhancement Program (VMEP) costs. ATSI estimated
      that it may defer approximately $54 million of such costs over a five-year
      period. Approximately $42 million has been deferred as of December 31, 2006.
      The
      effective date for recovery was June 1, 2006. The FERC conditionally approved
      the filing on May 22, 2006, and on July 14, 2006 FERC accepted the ATSI
      compliance filing. A request for rehearing of the FERC's May 22, 2006 Order
      was
      denied by FERC on October 25, 2006. The estimated annual revenues to ATSI from
      the VMEP cost recovery is $12 million for each of the five years beginning
      June 1, 2006.

On
      January 24, 2006,
      ATSI and MISO filed a request with the FERC to correct ATSI's Attachment 0
      formula rate to reverse revenue credits associated with termination of revenue
      streams from transitional rates stemming from FERC's elimination of RTOR between
      the Midwest ISO and PJM. Revenues formerly collected under these transitional
      rates were included in, and served to reduce, ATSI's zonal transmission rate
      under the Attachment O formula. Absent the requested correction, elimination
      of
      these revenue credits would not be fully reflected in ATSI's formula rate until
      June 1, 2008. On March 16, 2006, the FERC approved the revenue credit correction
      without suspension, effective April 1, 2006. One party sought rehearing of
      the
      FERC's order, which was denied on June 27, 2006. No petition for review of
      the
      FERC's decision was filed. The estimated revenue impact of the correction
      mechanism is approximately $37 million for the period June 1, 2006 though May
      31, 2007.

On
      November 18,
      2004, the FERC issued an order eliminating the RTOR for transmission service
      between the MISO and PJM regions. The FERC also ordered the MISO, PJM and the
      transmission owners within MISO and PJM to submit compliance filings containing
      a SECA mechanism to recover lost RTOR revenues during a 16-month transition
      period from load serving entities. The FERC issued orders in 2005 setting the
      SECA for hearing. ATSI, JCP&L, Met-Ed, Penelec, and FES participated in the
      FERC hearings held in May 2006 concerning the calculation and imposition of
      the
      SECA charges. The Presiding Judge issued an Initial Decision on August 10,
      2006,
      rejecting the compliance filings made by the RTOs and transmission owners,
      ruling on various issues and directing new compliance filings. This decision
      is
      subject to review and approval by the FERC. Briefs addressing the Initial
      Decision were filed on September 11, 2006 and October 20, 2006. A final order
      could be issued by the FERC in early 2007.

On
      January 31, 2005,
      certain PJM transmission owners made three filings with the FERC pursuant to
      a
      settlement agreement previously approved by the FERC. JCP&L, Met-Ed and
      Penelec were parties to that proceeding and joined in two of the filings. In
      the
      first filing, the settling transmission owners submitted a filing justifying
      continuation of their existing rate design within the PJM RTO. In the second
      filing, the settling transmission owners proposed a revised Schedule 12 to
      the
      PJM tariff designed to harmonize the rate treatment of new and existing
      transmission facilities. Interventions and protests were filed on February
      22,
      2005. In the third filing, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company and Pepco
      Holdings, Inc. requested a formula rate for transmission service provided within
      their respective zones. On May 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order on these
      cases. First, it set for hearing the existing rate design and indicated that
      it
      will issue a final order within six months. American Electric Power Company,
      Inc. filed in opposition proposing to create a "postage stamp" rate for high
      voltage transmission facilities across PJM. Second, the FERC approved the
      proposed Schedule 12 rate harmonization. Third, the FERC accepted the proposed
      formula rate, subject to refund and hearing procedures. On June 30, 2005, the
      settling PJM transmission owners filed a request for rehearing of the May 31,
      2005 order. On March 20, 2006, a settlement was filed with FERC in the formula
      rate proceeding that generally accepts the companies' formula rate proposal.
      The
      FERC issued an order approving this settlement on April 19, 2006. Hearings
      in
      the PJM rate design case concluded in April 2006. On July 13, 2006, an Initial
      Decision was issued by the ALJ. The ALJ adopted the FERC Trial Staff's position
      that the cost of all PJM transmission facilities should be recovered through
      a
      postage stamp rate.

The
      ALJ recommended
      an April 1, 2006 effective date for this change in rate design. If the FERC
      accepts this recommendation, the transmission rate applicable to many load
      zones
      in PJM would increase. FirstEnergy believes that significant additional
      transmission revenues would have to be recovered from the JCP&L, Met-Ed and
      Penelec transmission zones within PJM. JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec, as part of
      the Responsible Pricing Alliance, filed a brief addressing the Initial Decision
      on August 14, 2006 and September 5, 2006. The case will be reviewed by the
      FERC
      with a decision anticipated in early 2007.

On
      November 1, 2005,
      FES filed two power sales agreements for approval with the FERC. One power
      sales
      agreement provided for FES to provide the PLR requirements of the Ohio Companies
      at a price equal to the retail generation rates approved by the PUCO for a
      period of three years beginning January 1, 2006. The Ohio Companies will be
      relieved of their obligation to obtain PLR power requirements from FES if the
      Ohio CBP results in a lower price for retail customers. A similar power sales
      agreement between FES and Penn permits Penn to obtain its PLR power requirements
      from FES at a fixed price equal to the retail generation price during 2006.


On
      December 29,
      2005, the FERC issued an order setting the two power sales agreements for
      hearing. The order criticized the Ohio CBP, and required FES to submit
      additional evidence in support of the reasonableness of the prices charged
      in
      the power sales agreements. On July 14, 2006, the Chief Judge granted the joint
      motion of FES and the Trial Staff to appoint a settlement judge in this
      proceeding and the procedural schedule was suspended pending settlement
      discussions among the parties. A settlement conference was held on September
      5,
      2006. FES and the Ohio Companies, Penn, and the PUCO,

along
      with other
      parties, reached an agreement to settle the case. The settlement was filed
      with
      the FERC on October 17, 2006, and was unopposed by the remaining parties,
      including the FERC Trial Staff. This settlement was accepted by the FERC on
      December 8, 2006.

The
      terms of the
      settlement provide for modification of both the Ohio and Penn power supply
      agreements with FES. Under the Ohio power supply agreement, separate rates
      are
      established for the Ohio Companies' PLR requirements; special retail contract
      requirements, wholesale contract requirements, and interruptible buy-through
      retail load requirements. For their PLR and special retail contract
      requirements, the Ohio Companies will pay FES no more than the lower of (i)
      the
      sum of the retail generation charge, the rate stabilization charge, the fuel
      recovery mechanism charge, and FES' actual incremental fuel costs for such
      sales; or (ii) the wholesale price cap. Different wholesale price caps are
      imposed for PLR sales, special retail contracts, and wholesale contracts. The
      wholesale price for interruptible buy-through retail load requirements is
      limited to the actual spot price of power obtained by FES to provide this power.
      FES billed the Ohio Companies for the additional amount payable to FES for
      incremental fuel costs on power supplied during 2006. The total power supply
      cost billed by FES was lower in each case than the wholesale price caps
      specified in the settlement accepted by the FERC. In addition, pursuant to
      the
      settlement, the wholesale rate charged by FES under the Penn power supply
      agreement can be no greater than the generation component of charges for retail
      PLR load in Pennsylvania. The modifications to the Ohio and Pennsylvania power
      supply agreements became effective January 1, 2006. The Penn supply agreement
      subject to the settlement expired at midnight on December 31, 2006.

As
      a result of
      Penn's PLR competitive solicitation process approved by the PPUC for the period
      January 1, 2007 through May 31, 2008, FES was selected as the winning
      bidder for a number of the tranches for individual customer classes. The balance
      of the tranches will be supplied by unaffiliated power suppliers. On October
      2,
      2006, FES filed an application with the FERC under Section 205 of the Federal
      Power Act for authorization to make these affiliate sales to Penn. Interventions
      or protests were due on this filing on October 23, 2006. Penn was the only
      party
      to file an intervention in this proceeding. This filing was accepted by the
      FERC
      on November 15, 2006, and no requests for rehearing were filed.

On February 15, 2007, MISO filed documents with the FERC to establish a
      market-based, competitive ancillary services market. MISO contends that the
      filing will integrate operating reserves into MISO's existing day-ahead and
      real-time settlements process, incorporate opportunity costs into these markets,
      address scarcity pricing through the implementation of a demand curve
      methodology, foster demand response in the provision of operating reserves,
      and
      provide for various efficiencies and optimization with regard to generation
      dispatch. The filing also proposes amendments to existing documents to provide
      for the transfer of balancing functions from existing local balancing
      authorities to MISO. MISO will then carry out this reliability function as
      the
      NERC-certified balancing authority for the MISO region. MISO is targeting
      implementation for the second or third quarter of 2008. The FERC has established
      March 23, 2007, as the date for interested parties to submit comments addressing
      the filing. The filing has not yet been fully evaluated to assess its impact
      on FirstEnergy's operations.

On
      February 16, 2007, the FERC issued a final rule that revises its decade-old
      open
      access transmission regulations and policies. The FERC explained that the final
      rule is intended to strengthen non-discriminatory access to the transmission
      grid, facilitate FERC enforcement, and provide for a more open and coordinated
      transmission planning process. The final rule will not be effective until 60
      days after publication in the Federal Register. The final rule has not yet
      been
      fully evaluated to assess its impact on FirstEnergy's
      operations.

      FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries are:

FirstEnergy's
      investments for additional nuclear fuel during the 2007-2011 period are
      estimated to be approximately $893 million, of which about $86 million
      applies to 2007. During the same period, its nuclear fuel investments are
      expected to be reduced by approximately $702 million and $103 million,
      respectively, as the nuclear fuel is consumed. As a result of the intra-system
      generation assets transfers, NGC is now responsible for FirstEnergy's nuclear
      fuel investments. The following table displays the Companies' operating lease

FirstEnergy had approximately $1.1 billion of short-term indebtedness as of
      December 31, 2006, comprised of $1.0 billion in borrowings from a
      $2.75 billion revolving line of credit and $103 million of other bank
      borrowings. Total short-term bank lines of committed credit to FirstEnergy
      and
      the Companies as of December 31, 2006 were approximately $3.4 billion.


On August 24, 2006, FirstEnergy and certain of its subsidiaries entered into
      a
      new $2.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility, which replaced
      FirstEnergy's prior $2 billion credit facility. FirstEnergy may request an
      increase in the total commitments available under the new facility up to a
      maximum of $3.25 billion. Commitments under the new facility are available
      until August 24, 2011, unless the lenders agree, at the request of the
      Borrowers, to two additional one-year extensions. Generally, borrowings under
      the facility must be repaid within 364 days. Available amounts for each Borrower
      are subject to a specified sublimit, as well as applicable regulatory and other
      limitations. As of December 31, 2006, FirstEnergy was the only borrower on
      this
      revolver with an outstanding balance of $1.0 billion. The annual facility
      fee is 0.125%.

FirstEnergy may borrow under these facilities and could transfer any of its
      borrowings to its subsidiaries. These revolving credit facilities, combined
      with
      an aggregate $550 million of accounts receivable financing facilities for
      OE, CEI, TE, Met-Ed, Penelec and Penn, are intended to provide liquidity to
      meet
      FirstEnergy's short-term working capital requirements and those of its
      subsidiaries. Total unused borrowing capability under existing facilities and
      accounts receivable financing facilities totaled $1.8 billion as of
      December 31, 2006. An additional source of ongoing cash for FirstEnergy, as
      a holding company, is cash dividends from its subsidiaries. In 2006, the holding
      company received $560 million of cash dividends on common stock from its
      subsidiaries.

Based
      on their
      present plans, the Companies could provide for their cash requirements in 2007
      from the following sources: funds to be received from operations; available
      cash
      and temporary cash investments as of December 31, 2006 (FirstEnergy's
      non-utility subsidiaries - $90 million and OE - $1 million); the
      issuance of long-term debt (for refunding purposes); funds from capital markets
      and funds available under revolving credit arrangements.

The
      extent and type
      of future financings will depend on the need for external funds as well as
      market conditions, the maintenance of an appropriate capital structure and
      the
      ability of the Companies to comply with coverage requirements in order to issue
      FMB and preferred stock. The Companies will continue to monitor financial market
      conditions and, where appropriate, may take advantage of economic opportunities
      to refund debt to the extent that their financial resources permit.

The
      coverage
      requirements contained in the first mortgage indentures under which the
      Companies issue FMB provide that, except for certain refunding purposes, the
      Companies may not issue FMB unless applicable net earnings (before income
      taxes), calculated as provided in the indentures, for any period of twelve
      consecutive months within the fifteen calendar months preceding the month in
      which such additional bonds are issued, are at least twice annual interest
      requirements on outstanding FMB, including those being issued. As of
      December 31, 2006, the Ohio Companies and Penn had the aggregate capability
      to issue approximately $2.8 billion of additional FMB on the basis of
      property additions and retired bonds under the terms of their respective
      mortgage indentures. The issuance of FMB by OE, CEI and TE are also subject
      to
      provisions of their senior note indentures generally limiting the incurrence
      of
      additional secured debt, subject to certain exceptions that would permit, among
      other things, the issuance of secured debt (including FMB) (i) supporting
      pollution control notes or similar obligations, or (ii) as an extension, renewal
      or replacement of previously outstanding secured debt. In addition, these
      provisions would permit OE, CEI and TE to incur additional secured debt not
      otherwise permitted by a specified exception of up to $543 million,
      $491 million and $126 million, respectively, as of December 31,
      2006. Under the provisions of its senior note indenture, JCP&L may issue
      additional FMB only as collateral for senior notes. As of December 31,
      2006, JCP&L had the capability to issue $678 million of additional
      senior notes upon the basis of FMB collateral.

As of December 31, 2006, each of OE, TE, Penn and JCP&L have redeemed
      all of their outstanding preferred stock. As a result of these redemptions,
      the
      applicable earnings coverage tests in each of their respective charters are
      inoperative. In the event that any of OE, TE, Penn and JCP&L issues
      preferred stock in the future, the applicable earnings coverage test will govern
      the amount of preferred stock that may be issued. CEI, Met-Ed and Penelec do
      not
      have similar restrictions and could issue up to the number of preferred shares
      authorized under their respective charters.

To
      the extent that
      coverage requirements or market conditions restrict the Companies' abilities
      to
      issue desired amounts of FMB or preferred stock, the Companies may seek other
      methods of financing. Such financings could include the sale of preferred and/or
      preference stock or of such other types of securities as might be authorized
      by
      applicable regulatory authorities which would not otherwise be sold and could
      result in annual interest charges and/or dividend requirements in excess of
      those that would otherwise be incurred.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, approximately $1.0 billion of capacity remained
      unused under an existing shelf registration statement, filed by FirstEnergy
      with
      the SEC in 2003, to support future securities issuances. The shelf registration
      provides the flexibility to issue and sell various types of securities,
      including common stock, debt securities, and share purchase contracts and
      related share purchase units. As of December 31, 2006, OE and CEI had
      approximately $400 million and $250 million, respectively, of capacity
      remaining unused under their existing shelf registrations for unsecured debt
      securities.


Nuclear
      Regulation

On January 20, 2006, FENOC announced that it had entered into a deferred
      prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District
      of Ohio and the Environmental Crimes Section of the Environment and Natural
      Resources Division of the DOJ related to FENOC's communications with the NRC
      during the fall of 2001 in connection with the reactor head issue at the
      Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station. Under the agreement, the United States
      acknowledged FENOC's extensive corrective actions at Davis-Besse, FENOC's
      cooperation during investigations by the DOJ and the NRC, FENOC's pledge of
      continued cooperation in any related criminal and administrative investigations
      and proceedings, FENOC's acknowledgement of responsibility for the behavior
      of
      its employees, and its agreement to pay a monetary penalty. The DOJ agreed
      to
      refrain from seeking an indictment or otherwise initiating criminal prosecution
      of FENOC for all conduct related to the statement of facts attached to the
      deferred prosecution agreement, as long as FENOC remained in compliance with
      the
      agreement, which FENOC has done. FENOC paid a monetary penalty of
      $28 million (not deductible for income tax purposes) which reduced
      FirstEnergy's earnings by $0.09 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2005.
      The deferred prosecution agreement expired on December 31, 2006.

On April 21, 2005, the NRC issued a NOV and proposed a $5.45 million
      civil penalty related to the degradation of the Davis-Besse reactor vessel
      head
      issue described above. FirstEnergy accrued $2 million for a potential fine
      prior to 2005 and accrued the remaining liability for the proposed fine during
      the first quarter of 2005. On September 14, 2005, FENOC filed its response
      to the NOV with the NRC. FENOC accepted full responsibility for the past failure
      to properly implement its boric acid corrosion control and corrective action
      programs. The NRC NOV indicated that the violations do not represent current
      licensee performance FirstEnergy paid the penalty in the third quarter of 2005.
      On January 23, 2006, FENOC supplemented its response to the NRC's NOV on
      the Davis-Besse head degradation to reflect the deferred prosecution agreement
      that FENOC had reached with the DOJ

.

On August 12, 2004, the NRC notified FENOC that it would increase its
      regulatory oversight of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant as a result of problems
      with safety system equipment over the preceding two years and the licensee's
      failure to take prompt and corrective action. FENOC operates the Perry Nuclear
      Power Plant.

On April 4, 2005, the NRC held a public meeting to discuss FENOC's
      performance at the Perry Nuclear Power Plant as identified in the NRC's annual
      assessment letter to FENOC. Similar public meetings are held with all nuclear
      power plant licensees following issuance by the NRC of their annual assessments.
      According to the NRC, overall the Perry Plant operated "in a manner that
      preserved public health and safety" even though it remained under heightened
      NRC
      oversight. During the public meeting and in the annual assessment, the NRC
      indicated that additional inspections will continue and that the plant must
      improve performance to be removed from the Multiple/Repetitive Degraded
      Cornerstone Column of the Action Matrix.

On September 28, 2005, the NRC sent a CAL to FENOC describing commitments
      that FENOC had made to improve the performance at the Perry Nuclear Power Plant
      and stated that the CAL would remain open until substantial improvement was
      demonstrated. The CAL was anticipated as part of the NRC's Reactor Oversight
      Process. In the NRC's 2005 annual assessment letter dated March 2, 2006 and
      associated meetings to discuss the performance of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant
      on March 14, 2006, the NRC again stated that the Perry Nuclear Power Plant
      continued to operate in a manner that "preserved public health and safety."
      However, the NRC also stated that increased levels of regulatory oversight
      would
      continue until sustained improvement in the performance of the facility was
      realized. If performance does not improve, the NRC has a range of options under
      the Reactor Oversight Process, from increased oversight to possible impact
      to
      the plant's operating authority.

Nuclear
      Insurance

The
      Price-Anderson
      Act limits the public liability which can be assessed with respect to a nuclear
      power plant to $10.8 billion (assuming 104 units licensed to operate)
      for a single nuclear incident, which amount is covered by: (i) private insurance
      amounting to $300 million; and (ii) $10.5 billion provided by an
      industry retrospective rating plan required by the NRC pursuant thereto. Under
      such retrospective rating plan, in the event of a nuclear incident at any unit
      in the United States resulting in losses in excess of private insurance, up
      to
      $100.6 million (but not more than $15 million per unit per year in the
      event of more than one incident) must be contributed for each nuclear unit
      licensed to operate in the country by the licensees thereof to cover liabilities
      arising out of the incident. Based on its present nuclear ownership and
      leasehold interests, FirstEnergy's maximum potential assessment under these
      provisions would be $402.4 million (OE - $34.4 million, NGC -
      $349.6 million, and TE - $18.4 million) per incident but not more than
      $60 million (OE - $5.1 million, NGC - $52.1 million, and TE -
      $2.8 million) in any one year for each incident.


In
      addition to the
      public liability insurance provided pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act,
      FirstEnergy has also obtained insurance coverage in limited amounts for economic
      loss and property damage arising out of nuclear incidents. FirstEnergy is a
      member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) which provides coverage
      (NEIL I) for the extra expense of replacement power incurred due to
      prolonged accidental outages of nuclear units. Under NEIL I, FirstEnergy
      has policies, renewable yearly, corresponding to its nuclear interests, which
      provide an aggregate indemnity of up to approximately $1.96 billion (OE -
      $168 million, NGC - $1.703 billion, TE - $89 million) for
      replacement power costs incurred during an outage after an initial 20-week
      waiting period. Members of NEIL I pay annual premiums and are subject to
      assessments if losses exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer.
      FirstEnergy's present maximum aggregate assessment for incidents at any covered
      nuclear facility occurring during a policy year would be approximately
      $15.1 million (OE - $1.3 million, NGC - $13.2 million, and TE -
      $0.6 million).

FirstEnergy is insured under property damage insurance provided by NEIL to
      the
      operating company for each plant. Under these arrangements, up to
      $2.75 billion of coverage for decontamination costs, decommissioning costs,
      debris removal and repair and/or replacement of property is provided.
      FirstEnergy pays annual premiums for this coverage and is liable for
      retrospective assessments of up to approximately $56.8 million (OE -
      $5.3 million, NGC - $48.5 million, TE - $2.2 million, Met-Ed -
      $0.4 million, Penelec - $0.2 million and JCP&L -
      $0.2 million) during a policy year. On September 30, 2003, FirstEnergy
      tendered a Proof of Loss under the NEIL policies for property damage and
      accidental outage losses associated with the extended outage at the Davis-Besse
      Nuclear Power Station, which began in February 2002. In December 2004, NEIL
      denied FirstEnergy's claim. FirstEnergy requested binding arbitration under
      the
      policies and has submitted expert testimony to support its claim. Under NEIL's
      policies, the arbitrators shall award reasonable attorney's fees and costs
      to
      the prevailing party.

FirstEnergy
      intends
      to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as described above as long as it
      is
      available. To the extent that replacement power, property damage,
      decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement costs and other such
      costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of FirstEnergy's plants exceed
      the
      policy limits of the insurance in effect with respect to that plant, to the
      extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be covered by FirstEnergy's
      insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance becomes unavailable in
      the
      future, FirstEnergy would remain at risk for such costs.

The
      NRC requires
      nuclear power plant licensees to obtain minimum property insurance coverage
      of
      $1.06 billion or the amount generally available from private sources,
      whichever is less. The proceeds of this insurance are required to be used first
      to ensure that the licensed reactor is in a safe and stable condition and can
      be
      maintained in that condition so as to prevent any significant risk to the public
      health and safety. Within 30 days of stabilization, the licensee is required
      to
      prepare and submit to the NRC a cleanup plan for approval. The plan is required
      to identify all cleanup operations necessary to decontaminate the reactor
      sufficiently to permit the resumption of operations or to commence
      decommissioning. Any property insurance proceeds not already expended to place
      the reactor in a safe and stable condition must be used first to complete those
      decontamination operations that are ordered by the NRC. FirstEnergy is unable
      to
      predict what effect these requirements may have on the availability of insurance
      proceeds.

Environmental
      Matters

Various federal, state and local authorities regulate FirstEnergy with regard
      to
      air and water quality and other environmental matters. The effects of compliance
      on FirstEnergy with regard to environmental matters could have a material
      adverse effect on FirstEnergy's earnings and competitive position to the extent
      that it competes with companies that are not subject to such regulations and
      therefore do not bear the risk of costs associated with compliance, or failure
      to comply, with such regulations. Overall, FirstEnergy believes it is in
      compliance with existing regulations but is unable to predict future changes
      in
      regulatory policies and what, if any, the effects of such changes would be.
      FirstEnergy estimates additional capital expenditures for environmental
      compliance of approximately $1.8 billion for 2007 through 2011.

FirstEnergy accrues environmental liabilities only when it concludes that it
      is
      probable that it has an obligation for such costs and can reasonably estimate
      the amount of such costs. Unasserted claims are reflected in FirstEnergy's
      determination of environmental liabilities and are accrued in the period that
      they become both probable and reasonably estimable.

Clean
      Air Act
      Compliance

FirstEnergy is required to meet federally-approved SO


emissions
      regulations. Violations of such regulations can result in shutdown of the
      generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to $32,500
      for
      each day the unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim enforcement policy
      for
      SO


regulations in Ohio
      that allows for compliance based on a 30-day averaging period. FirstEnergy
      believes it is currently in compliance with this policy, but cannot predict
      what
      action the EPA may take in the future with respect to the interim enforcement
      policy.


The EPA Region 5 issued a Finding of Violation and NOV to the Bay Shore Power
      Plant dated June 15, 2006 alleging violations to various sections of the Clean
      Air Act. FirstEnergy has disputed those alleged violations based on its Clean
      Air Act permit, the Ohio SIP and other information provided at an August 2006
      meeting with the EPA. The EPA has several enforcement options (administrative
      compliance order, administrative penalty order, and/or judicial, civil or
      criminal action) and has indicated that such option may depend on the time
      needed to achieve and demonstrate compliance with the rules alleged to have
      been
      violated.

FirstEnergy complies with SO


reduction
      requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 by burning lower-sulfur
      fuel, generating more electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using
      emission allowances.

NO

X

reductions required
      by the 1990 Amendments are being achieved through combustion controls and the
      generation of more electricity at lower-emitting plants. In September 1998,
      the
      EPA finalized regulations requiring additional

NO

X

reductions at
      FirstEnergy's facilities. The EPA's

NO

X

Transport Rule
      imposes uniform reductions of

NO

X

emissions (an
      approximate 85% reduction in utility plant

NO

X

emissions from
      projected 2007 emissions) across a region of nineteen states (including
      Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania) and the District of Columbia based
      on a conclusion that such

NO

X

emissions are
      contributing significantly to ozone levels in the eastern United States.
      FirstEnergy believes its facilities are also complying with the

NO

X

budgets established
      under SIPs through combustion controls and post-combustion controls, including
      Selective Catalytic Reduction and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction systems,
      and/or using emission allowances.

National
      Ambient
      Air Quality Standards

In July 1997, the EPA promulgated changes in the NAAQS for ozone and fine
      particulate matter. In March 2005, the EPA finalized the CAIR covering a
      total of 28 states (including Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania)
      and
      the District of Columbia based on proposed findings that air emissions from
      eastern states and the District of Columbia significantly contribute to
      non-attainment of the NAAQS for fine particles and/or the "8-hour" ozone NAAQS
      in other states. CAIR provided each affected state until 2006 to develop
      implementing regulations to achieve additional reductions of

NO

X

and SO


emissions in two
      phases (Phase I in 2009 for NO

X

,
      2010 for
      SO


and Phase II in
      2015 for both

NO

X

and SO


).
      FirstEnergy's
      Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania fossil-fired generation facilities will be
      subject to caps on SO


and NO

X

emissions, whereas
      its New Jersey fossil-fired generation facility will be subject to only a cap
      on

NO

X

emissions.
      According to the EPA, SO


emissions will be
      reduced by 45% (from 2003 levels) by 2010 across the states covered by the
      rule,
      with reductions reaching 73% (from 2003 levels) by 2015, capping SO


emissions in
      affected states to just 2.5 million tons annually. NO

X

emissions will be
      reduced by 53% (from 2003 levels) by 2009 across the states covered by the
      rule,
      with reductions reaching 61% (from 2003 levels) by 2015, achieving a regional

NO

X

cap of 1.3 million
      tons annually. The future cost of compliance with these regulations may be
      substantial and will depend on how they are ultimately implemented by the states
      in which FirstEnergy operates affected facilities.

Mercury
      Emissions

In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the development of
      regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric power plants,
      identifying mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of greatest concern. In
      March
      2005, the EPA finalized the CAMR, which provides a cap-and-trade program to
      reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants in two phases. Initially,
      mercury emissions will be capped nationally at 38 tons by 2010 (as a
      "co-benefit" from implementation of SO


and

NO

X

emission caps under
      the EPA's CAIR program). Phase II of the mercury cap-and-trade program will
      cap
      nationwide mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants at 15 tons per
      year by 2018. However, the final rules give states substantial discretion in
      developing rules to implement these programs. In addition, both the CAIR and
      the
      CAMR have been challenged in the United States Court of Appeals for the District
      of Columbia. FirstEnergy's future cost of compliance with these regulations
      may
      be substantial and will depend on how they are ultimately implemented by the
      states in which FirstEnergy operates affected facilities.

The model rules for both CAIR and CAMR contemplate an input-based methodology
      to
      allocate allowances to affected facilities. Under this approach, allowances
      would be allocated based on the amount of fuel consumed by the affected sources.
      FirstEnergy would prefer an output-based generation-neutral methodology in
      which
      allowances are allocated based on megawatts of power produced, allowing new
      and
      non-emitting generating facilities (including renewables and nuclear) to be
      entitled to their proportionate share of the allowances. Consequently,
      FirstEnergy will be disadvantaged if these model rules were implemented as
      proposed because FirstEnergy's substantial reliance on non-emitting (largely
      nuclear) generation is not recognized under the input-based
      allocation.

Pennsylvania has submitted a new mercury rule for EPA approval that does not
      provide a cap and trade approach as in the CAMR, but rather follows a command
      and control approach imposing emission limits on individual sources.
      Pennsylvania's mercury regulation would deprive FES of mercury emission
      allowances that were to be allocated to the Mansfield Plant under the CAMR
      and
      that would otherwise be available for achieving FirstEnergy system-wide
      compliance. The future cost of compliance with these regulations, if approved
      and implemented, may be substantial.


W.
      H. Sammis
      Plan

In
      1999 and 2000, the
      EPA issued NOV or compliance orders to nine utilities alleging violations of
      the
      Clean Air Act based on operation and maintenance of 44 power plants, including
      the W. H. Sammis Plant, which was owned at that time by OE and Penn. In
      addition, the DOJ filed eight civil complaints against various investor-owned
      utilities, including a complaint against OE and Penn in the U.S. District Court
      for the Southern District of Ohio. These cases are referred to as the New Source
      Review cases.

On March 18, 2005, OE and Penn announced that they had reached a settlement
      with
      the EPA, the DOJ and three states (Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York) that
      resolved all issues related to the New Source Review litigation. This settlement
      agreement, which is in the form of a consent decree, was approved by the Court
      on July 11, 2005, and requires reductions of NO

X

and SO


emissions at the W.
      H. Sammis Plant and other coal-fired plants through the installation of
      pollution control devices and provides for stipulated penalties for failure
      to
      install and operate such pollution controls in accordance with that agreement.
      Consequently, if we fail to install such pollution control devices, for any
      reason, including, but not limited to, the failure of any third-party contractor
      to timely meet its delivery obligations for such devices, we could be exposed
      to
      penalties under the Sammis NSR Litigation consent decree. Capital expenditures
      necessary to complete requirements of the Sammis NSR Litigation are currently
      estimated to be $1.5 billion ($400 million of which is expected to be spent
      in
      2007, with the largest portion of the remaining $1.1 billion expected to be
      spent in 2008 and 2009).

The Sammis NSR Litigation consent decree also requires us to spend up to
      $25 million toward environmentally beneficial projects, $14 million of
      which is satisfied by entering into 93 MW (or 23 MW if federal tax credits
      are
      not applicable) of wind energy purchased power agreements with a 20-year term.
      An initial 16 MW of the 93 MW consent decree obligation was satisfied
      during 2006.

On August 26, 2005, FGCO entered into an agreement with Bechtel under which
        Bechtel will engineer, procure, and construct air quality control systems
        for
        the reduction of SO


emissions. FGCO
        also entered into an agreement with B&W on August 25, 2006 to supply flue
        gas desulfurization systems for the reduction of SO


emissions.
        Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems for the reduction of NOx emissions
        also are being installed at the W.H. Sammis Plant under a 1999 agreement
        with
        B&W.

OE and Penn agreed to pay a civil penalty of $8.5 million. Results for the
        first quarter of 2005 included the penalties paid by OE and Penn of
        $7.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively. OE and Penn also
        recognized liabilities in the first quarter of 2005 of $9.2 million and
        $0.8 million, respectively, for probable future cash contributions toward
        environmentally beneficial projects.

Climate
      Change

In December 1997, delegates to the United Nations' climate summit in Japan
      adopted an agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, to address global warming by reducing
      the amount of man-made GHG emitted by developed countries by 5.2% from 1990
      levels between 2008 and 2012. The United States signed the Kyoto Protocol in
      1998 but it failed to receive the two-thirds vote required for ratification
      by
      the United States Senate. However, the Bush administration has committed the
      United States to a voluntary climate change strategy to reduce domestic GHG
      intensity - the ratio of emissions to economic output - by 18% through 2012.
      The
      EPACT established a Committee on Climate Change Technology to coordinate federal
      climate change activities and promote the development and deployment of GHG
      reducing technologies.

FirstEnergy
      cannot currently estimate the financial impact of climate change policies,
      although the potential restrictions on CO


emissions could
      require significant capital and other expenditures. The CO


emissions per KWH
      of electricity generated by FirstEnergy is lower than many regional competitors
      due to its diversified generation sources, which include low or
      non-CO


emitting gas-fired
      and nuclear generators.

Clean
      Water
      Act

Various water quality regulations, the majority of which are the result of
      the
      federal Clean Water Act and its amendments, apply to FirstEnergy's plants.
      In
      addition, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have water quality standards
      applicable to FirstEnergy's operations. As provided in the Clean Water Act,
      authority to grant federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
      water
      discharge permits can be assumed by a state. Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania
      have assumed such authority.


On September 7, 2004, the EPA established new performance standards under
      Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act for reducing impacts on fish and shellfish
      from cooling water intake structures at certain existing large electric
      generating plants. The regulations call for reductions in impingement mortality,
      when aquatic organisms are pinned against screens or other parts of a cooling
      water intake system, and entrainment, which occurs when aquatic life is drawn
      into a facility's cooling water system. On January 26, 2007, the federal Court
      of Appeals for the Second Circuit remanded portions of the rulemaking dealing
      with impingement mortality and entrainment back to EPA for further rulemaking
      and eliminated the restoration option from EPA's regulations. FirstEnergy is
      conducting comprehensive demonstration studies, due in 2008, to determine the
      operational measures or equipment, if any, necessary for compliance by its
      facilities with the performance standards. FirstEnergy is unable to predict
      the
      outcome of such studies or changes in these requirements from the remand to
      EPA.
      Depending on the outcome of such studies and EPA's further rulemaking, the
      future cost of compliance with these standards may require material capital
      expenditures.

Regulation
      of
      Hazardous Waste

As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended,
      and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state hazardous waste
      regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel combustion waste
      products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste disposal
      requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future regulation.
      The
      EPA subsequently determined that regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste
      is
      unnecessary. In April 2000, the EPA announced that it will develop national
      standards regulating disposal of coal ash under its authority to regulate
      nonhazardous waste.

Under NRC regulations, FirstEnergy must ensure that adequate funds will be
      available to decommission its nuclear facilities. As of December 31, 2006,
      FirstEnergy had approximately $1.4 billion invested in external trusts to be
      used for the decommissioning and environmental remediation of Davis-Besse,
      Beaver Valley and Perry. As part of the application to the NRC to transfer
      the
      ownership of these nuclear facilities to NGC, FirstEnergy agreed to contribute
      another $80 million to these trusts by 2010. Consistent with NRC guidance,
      utilizing a "real" rate of return on these funds of approximately 2% over
      inflation, these trusts are expected to exceed the minimum decommissioning
      funding requirements set by the NRC. Conservatively, these estimates do not
      include any rate of return that the trusts may earn over the 20-year plant
      useful life extensions that FirstEnergy plans to seek for these
      facilities.

The
      Companies have
      been named as PRPs at waste disposal sites, which may require cleanup under
      the
      Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980.
      Allegations of disposal of hazardous substances at historical sites and the
      liability involved are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute; however,
      federal law provides that all PRPs for a particular site are liable on a joint
      and several basis. Therefore, environmental liabilities that are considered
      probable have been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
      December 31, 2006, based on estimates of the total costs of cleanup, the
      Companies' proportionate responsibility for such costs and the financial ability
      of other unaffiliated entities to pay. In addition, JCP&L has accrued
      liabilities for environmental remediation of former manufactured gas plants
      in
      New Jersey; those costs are being recovered by JCP&L through a
      non-bypassable SBC. Total liabilities of approximately $88 million
      (JCP&L - $59 million, CEI - $2 million, TE - $3 million, and
      other subsidiaries- $24 million) have been accrued through
      December 31, 2006.

Fuel
      Supply

FirstEnergy
      currently has long-term coal contracts to provide approximately
      21.3 million tons of coal for the year 2007. This contract coal is produced
      primarily from mines located in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Wyoming, West Virginia
      and Ohio. The contracts expire at various times through December 31, 2028.
      FirstEnergy estimates its 2007 coal requirements to be approximately
      23.2 million tons to be met from the long-term contracts as well as from
      spot market purchases. See "Environmental Matters" for factors pertaining to
      meeting environmental regulations affecting coal-fired generating
      units.

FirstEnergy
      is
      contracted for all uranium requirements through 2009 and a portion of
      uranium material requirements through 2014. Conversion services contracts fully
      cover requirements through 2010 and partially fill requirements through 2015.
      Enrichment services are contracted for all of the enrichment requirements for
      nuclear fuel through 2011. A portion of enrichment requirements is also
      contracted for through 2020. Fabrication services for fuel assemblies are
      contracted for both Beaver Valley units and Davis Besse through 2013 and through
      the operating license period for Perry (through approximately 2026). The
      Davis-Besse fabrication contract also has an extension provision for services
      for three additional consecutive reload batches through the current operating
      license period (approximately 2017). In addition to the existing commitments,
      FirstEnergy intends to make additional arrangements for the supply of uranium
      and for the subsequent conversion, enrichment, fabrication, and waste disposal
      services.


On-site
      spent fuel
      storage facilities are expected to be adequate for Perry through 2011;
      facilities at Beaver Valley Units 1 and 2 are expected to be adequate
      through 2015 and 2008, respectively. With the plant modifications completed
      in
      2002, Davis-Besse has adequate storage through the remainder of its current
      operating license period. After current on-site storage capacity is exhausted,
      additional storage capacity will have to be obtained either through plant
      modifications, interim off-site disposal, or permanent waste disposal
      facilities. FENOC is currently taking actions to extend the storage capacity
      at
      both Perry and Beaver Valley Unit 2. The Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
      1982 provides for the construction of facilities for the permanent disposal
      of
      high-level nuclear wastes, including spent fuel from nuclear power plants
      operated by electric utilities. CEI, TE, OE and Penn have contracts with the
      U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the disposal of spent fuel for Beaver
      Valley, Davis-Besse and Perry. On February 15, 2002, President Bush
      approved the DOE's recommendation of Yucca Mountain for underground disposal
      of
      spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants and high level waste from U.S.
      defense programs. The approval by President Bush enables the process to proceed
      to the licensing phase. Based on the DOE schedule published on July 19, 2006,
      the Yucca Mountain Repository is currently projected to start receiving spent
      fuel in 2017. The Companies intend to make additional arrangements for storage
      capacity as a contingency for further delays with the DOE acceptance of spent
      fuel for disposal past 2017.

System
      Capacity and Reserves

The
      2006 net maximum
      hourly demand for each of the Companies was: OE-6,024 MW on August 1, 2006;
      Penn-1,024 MW on August 1, 2006; CEI-4,674 MW on August 1, 2006; TE-2,276 MW
      on
      July 31, 2006; JCP&L-6,702 MW on August 2, 2006; Met-Ed-2,996 MW on
      August 2, 2006; and Penelec-3,069 MW on August 2, 2006

.

JCP&L's
      load is
      supplied through the New Jersey BGS Auction process, transferring substantially
      all of its load obligation to other parties.

Based
      on existing
      capacity plans, ongoing arrangements for firm purchase contracts, and
      anticipated term power sales and purchases, FirstEnergy has sufficient supply
      resources to meet load obligations. The current FirstEnergy capacity portfolio
      contains 13,578 MW of owned or leased generation, 463 MW of generation from
      our
      20.5% ownership of OVEC, and approximately 1,360 MW of long-term purchases
      from
      Pennsylvania and New Jersey NUGs. FirstEnergy has also entered into
      approximately 314 MW of long-term purchase contracts for renewable energy from
      wind resources. Any remaining load obligations will be met through a mix of
      multi-year forward purchases, short-term forward purchases (less than one year)
      and spot market purchases. FirstEnergy's sources of generation during 2006
      were
      64% and 36% from non-nuclear and nuclear, respectively.

Regional
      Reliability

The
      Ohio Companies
      and Penn participate with 24 other electric companies operating in nine states
      in ECAR, which was organized for the purpose of furthering the reliability
      of
      bulk power supply in the area through coordination of the planning and operation
      by the ECAR members of their bulk power supply facilities. The ECAR members
      have
      established principles and procedures regarding matters affecting the
      reliability of the bulk power supply within the ECAR region. Procedures have
      been adopted regarding: i) the evaluation and simulated testing of systems'
      performance; ii) the establishment of minimum levels of daily operating
      reserves; iii) the development of a program regarding emergency procedures
      during conditions of declining system frequency; and iv) the basis for
      uniform rating of generating equipment.

The ECAR, Mid-Atlantic Area Council, and Mid-American Interconnected Network
      reliability councils completed the consolidation of these regions into a single
      new regional reliability organization known as Reliability

First

Corporation.
      Reliability

First

began operations as
      a regional reliability council under NERC on January 1, 2006 and on
      November 29, 2006 filed a proposed Delegation Agreement with NERC to obtain
      certification consistent with the final rule as a "regional entity" under the
      ERO. All of FirstEnergy's facilities are located within the
      Reliability

First

region.

The transmission facilities of JCP&L, Met-Ed, and Penelec are controlled by
      PJM. PJM is the organization responsible for the control of the bulk electric
      power system throughout major portions of thirteen Mid-Atlantic states and
      the
      District of Columbia. PJM is dedicated to meeting the reliability criteria
      and
      standards of NERC and the Reliability

First

Regional
      Reliability Organization.

Competition

The
      Companies
      compete with other utilities for intersystem bulk power sales and for sales
      to
      municipalities and cooperatives. The Companies also compete with suppliers
      of
      natural gas and other forms of energy in connection with their industrial and
      commercial sales and in the home climate control market, both with respect
      to
      new customers and conversions, and with all other suppliers of electricity.
      To
      date, there has been no substantial cogeneration by the Companies'
      customers.


As
      a result of
      actions taken by state legislative bodies over the last few years, major changes
      in the electric utility business have occurred in parts of the United States,
      including Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania where FirstEnergy's utility
      subsidiaries operate. These changes have resulted in fundamental alterations
      in
      the way traditional integrated utilities and holding company systems, like
      FirstEnergy, conduct their business. In accordance with the Ohio electric
      utility restructuring law under which Ohio electric customers could begin
      choosing their electric generation suppliers starting in January 2001,
      FirstEnergy has further aligned its business units to accommodate its retail
      strategy and participate in the competitive electricity marketplace in Ohio.
      The
      organizational changes deal with the unbundling of electric utility services
      and
      new ways of conducting business. FirstEnergy's Power Supply Management Services
      segment participates in deregulated energy markets in Ohio, Pennsylvania,
      Michigan, Maryland and New Jersey.

Competition
      in
      Ohio's electric generation market began on January 1, 2001. Pursuant to the
      generation asset transfers on October 24, 2005 and December 16, 2005, FGCO
      and
      NGC own all of the fossil and nuclear generation assets, respectively,
      previously owned by the Ohio Companies and Penn, and continue to operate those
      companies' respective leasehold interests. The Ohio Companies continue to obtain
      their PLR requirements through power supply agreements with FES. JCP&L's
      obligation to provide BGS has been removed through a transitional mechanism
      of
      auctioning the obligation (see "NJBPU Rate Matters"). Met-Ed and Penelec have
      been purchasing a portion of their PLR requirements from FES through a partial
      requirements wholesale power sales agreement and various amendments. Under
      these
      agreements, FES retained the supply obligation and the supply profit and loss
      risk for the portion of power supply requirements not self-supplied by Met-Ed
      and Penelec.

On
      January 17, 2007,
      Met-Ed, Penelec and FES agreed to restate, effective January 1, 2007, their
      partial requirements wholesale power sales agreement. The restated agreement
      incorporates the same fixed price for residual capacity and energy supplied
      by
      FES as in prior arrangements and allows Met-Ed and Penelec to sell the output
      of
      non-utility generation to the market

(see
      "PPUC Rate
      Matters" for further discussion). As a result of Penn's PLR competitive
      solicitation process approved by the PPUC for the period January 1, 2007
      through May 31, 2008, FES was selected as the winning bidder for a number
      of the tranches for individual customer classes. The balance of the tranches
      will be supplied by unaffiliated power suppliers.

Research
      and
      Development

The
      Companies
      participate in funding EPRI, which was formed for the purpose of expanding
      electric research and development under the voluntary sponsorship of the
      nation's electric utility industry - public, private and cooperative.
      Its goal is to mutually benefit utilities and their customers by promoting
      the
      development of new and improved technologies to help the utility industry meet
      present and future electric energy needs in environmentally and economically
      acceptable ways. EPRI conducts research on all aspects of electric power
      production and use, including fuels, generation, delivery, energy management
      and
      conservation, environmental effects and energy analysis. The major portion
      of
      EPRI research and development projects is directed toward practical solutions
      and their applications to problems currently facing the electric utility
      industry.

      149 for Penn; 1,137 for JCP&L; 520 for Met-Ed; 619 for Penelec; 1,252 for
      FES; and 969 for FENOC) are covered by collective bargaining
      agreements.

JCP&L's bargaining unit employees filed a grievance challenging JCP&L's
      2002 call-out procedure that required bargaining unit employees to respond
      to
      emergency power outages. On May 20, 2004, an arbitration panel concluded
      that the call-out procedure violated the parties' collective bargaining
      agreement. At the conclusion of the June 1, 2005 hearing, the arbitration
      panel decided not to hear testimony on damages and closed the proceedings.
      On
      September 9, 2005, the arbitration panel issued an opinion to award
      approximately $16 million to the bargaining unit employees. On February 6,
      2006, a federal district court granted a union motion to dismiss, as premature,
      a JCP&L appeal of the award filed on October 18, 2005. JCP&L
      intends to re-file an appeal again in federal district court once the damages
      associated with this case are identified at an individual employee level.
      JCP&L recognized a liability for the potential $16 million award in
      2005.

ITEM
      1A.
      RISK FACTORS

We operate in a business environment that involves significant risks, many
      of
      which are beyond our control. Below, we have identified risks we currently
      consider material. However, our business, financial condition, cash flows or
      results of operations could be affected materially and adversely by additional
      risks not currently known to us or that we deem immaterial at this time.
      Additional information on risk factors is included in "Item 1. Business" and
      "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
      of Operations" and in other sections that include forward-looking and other
      statements involving risks and uncertainties that could impact our business
      and
      financial results.

Risks
      Related to Business Operations

Risks
      Arising
      from the Reliability of Our Power Plants and Transmission and Distribution
      Equipment

Operation
      of
      generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves risk, including
      potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, labor
      disputes and performance below expected levels. In addition, weather-related
      incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation, transmission
      and
      distribution delivery systems. Because our transmission facilities are
      interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of those facilities
      could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring
      on
      the systems of such third parties.


Operation
      of our
      power plants below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues or
      increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages may
      require us to incur significant replacement power costs. Moreover, if we were
      unable to perform under contractual obligations, penalties or liability for
      damages could result. OE, CEI, and TE are exposed to losses under their
      applicable sale-leaseback arrangements for generating facilities upon the
      occurrence of certain contingent events that could render those facilities
      worthless. Although we believe these types of events are unlikely to occur,
      OE,
      CEI and TE each have a maximum exposure to loss under those provisions of
      approximately $1 billion.

We
      remain obligated
      to provide safe and reliable service to customers within our franchised service
      territories. Meeting this commitment requires the expenditure of significant
      capital resources. Failure to provide safe and reliable service and failure
      to
      meet regulatory reliability standards due to a number of factors, including
      equipment failure and weather, could adversely affect our operating results
      through reduced revenues and increased capital and maintenance costs and the
      imposition of penalties/fines or other adverse regulatory outcomes.

Changes
      in
      Commodity Prices Could Adversely Affect Our Profit Margins

While
      much of our
      generation currently serves customers under retail rates set by regulatory
      bodies, we also purchase and sell electricity in the competitive wholesale
      and
      retail markets. Increases in the costs of fuel for our generation facilities
      (particularly coal and natural gas) can affect our profit margins in both
      competitive and non-competitive markets. Changes in the market prices of
      electricity, which are affected by changes in other commodity costs and other
      factors, may impact our results of operations and financial position by
      increasing the amount we pay to purchase power to supply PLR obligations in
      Ohio
      and Pennsylvania.

Electricity
      and fuel
      prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time for
      a
      variety of reasons, including:

We
          Are Exposed
          to Operational, Price and Credit Risks Associated With Selling and Marketing
          Products in the Power Markets That We Do Not Always Completely Hedge
          Against

We
      purchase and sell
      power at the wholesale level under market-based tariffs authorized by the FERC,
      and also enter into short-term agreements to sell available energy and capacity
      from our generation assets. If we are unable to deliver firm capacity and energy
      under these agreements, we may be required to pay damages. These damages would
      generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire
      replacement capacity or energy and the contract price of the undelivered
      capacity or energy. Depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy
      markets, such damages could be significant

.

Extreme
      weather
      conditions, unplanned power plant outages, transmission disruptions, and other
      factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause increases
      in
      the market price of replacement capacity and energy.


We
      attempt to
      mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual power sales
      arrangements by reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity to satisfy
      our net firm sales contracts and, when necessary, by purchasing firm
      transmission service. We also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel
      and
      power purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements
      and other energy-related commodities. We may not, however, hedge the entire
      exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. To the extent we
      do
      not hedge against commodity price volatility, our results of operations and
      financial position could be negatively affected.

Our
      Risk
      Management Policies Relating to Energy and Fuel Prices, and Counterparty Credit
      are by Their Very Nature Risk Related, and We Could Suffer Economic Losses
      Despite Such Policies

We
      attempt to manage
      the market risk inherent in our energy and fuel and debt positions. Procedures
      have been implemented to enhance and monitor compliance with our risk management
      policies, including validation of transaction and market prices, verification
      of
      risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analysis and daily portfolio reporting
      of various risk measurement metrics. Nonetheless, we cannot economically hedge
      against all of our exposures in these areas and our risk management program
      may
      not operate as planned. For instance, actual electricity and fuel prices may
      be
      significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and
      assumptions upon which we based our risk management positions. Also, our power
      plants might not produce the expected amount of power during a given day or
      time
      period due to weather conditions, technical problems or other unanticipated
      events, which could require us to make energy purchases at higher prices than
      the prices under our energy supply contracts. In addition, the amount of fuel
      required for our power plants during a given day or time period could be more
      than expected, which could require us to buy additional fuel at prices less
      favorable than the prices under our fuel contracts. As a result, we cannot
      always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us
      if
      actual events lead to greater losses or costs than our risk management positions
      were intended to hedge.

We
      also face credit
      risks that parties with whom we contract could default in their performance,
      in
      which cases we could be forced to sell our power into a lower-priced market
      or
      make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the time of contract.
      Although we have established risk management policies and programs, including
      credit policies to evaluate counterparty credit risk, there can be no assurance
      that we will be able to fully meet our obligations, that we will not be required
      to pay damages for failure to perform or that we will not experience
      counterparty non-performance or that we will collect for voided contracts.
      If
      counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter
      into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at
      then-current market prices. In that event, our financial results would likely
      be
      adversely affected.

Nuclear
      Generation Involves Risks that Include Uncertainties Relating to Health and
      Safety, Additional Capital Costs, the Adequacy of Insurance Coverage and Nuclear
      Plant Decommissioning

FirstEnergy
      is
      subject to the risks of nuclear generation, including but not limited to the
      following:

·

the
                potential
                harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from
                certain
                unplanned radiological releases associated with the operation of
                our
                nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive
                materials;

·

limitations
                on
                the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover
                losses
                that might arise in connection with our nuclear operations or those
                of
                others in the United States;

·

uncertainties
                with respect to contingencies and assessments if insurance coverage
                is
                inadequate

and

·

uncertainties
                with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning
                nuclear plants at the end of their licensed
                operation.

The
      NRC has broad
      authority under federal law to impose licensing security and safety-related
      requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event
      of
      non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down
      a
      unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until
      compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC
      could
      necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants, including ours.

FirstEnergy's
      nuclear facilities are insured under NEIL policies issued for each plant. Under
      these policies, up to $2.75 billion of insurance coverage is provided for
      property damage and decontamination and decommissioning costs. We have also
      obtained approximately $2.0 billion of insurance coverage for replacement power
      costs. Under these policies, we can be assessed a maximum of approximately
      $72
      million for incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring during a policy
      year that are in excess of accumulated funds available to the insurer for paying
      losses.


The
      Price-Anderson
      Act limits the public liability which can be assessed with respect to a nuclear
      power plant to $10.8 billion (assuming 104 units licensed to operate in the
      United States) for a single nuclear incident, which amount is covered by:

(i)
      private insurance amounting to $300.0 million; and (ii) $10.5 billion provided
      by an industry retrospective rating plan. Under such retrospective rating plan,
      in the event of a nuclear incident at any unit in the United States resulting
      in
      losses in excess of private insurance, up to $100.6 million (but not more than
      $15.0 million per year) must be contributed for each nuclear unit licensed
      to
      operate in the country by the licensees thereof to cover liabilities arising
      out
      of the incident. Based on our present nuclear ownership, the maximum potential
      assessment under these provisions would be $402.4 million per incident but
      not
      more than $60.0 million in any one year.

We
      Rely on
      Transmission and Distribution Assets that we do not Own or Control to Deliver
      Our Wholesale Electricity. If Transmission is Disrupted Including Our Own
      Transmission, or not Operated Efficiently, or if Capacity is Inadequate, Our
      Ability to Sell and Deliver Power may be Hindered.

We
      depend on
      transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and
      other energy companies to deliver the electricity we sell. If transmission
      is
      disrupted (as a result of weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not
      operated efficiently by ISOs, in applicable markets, or if capacity is
      inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy our contractual
      obligations may be hindered, or we may be unable to sell products on the most
      favorable terms.

Demand
      for
      electricity within our service areas could stress available transmission
      capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailing of electricity usage with
      consequent effects on operating costs, revenues and results of operations.
      In
      addition, as with all utilities, potential concerns over transmission capacity
      could result in MISO, PJM or the FERC requiring us to upgrade or expand our
      transmission system through additional capital expenditures.

The
      FERC has issued
      regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered
      on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. Although these regulations are
      designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for
      electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission
      systems will not be available or that sufficient transmission capacity will
      not
      be available to transmit electricity as we desire. We cannot predict the timing
      of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of
      transmission facilities in specific markets or whether ISOs in applicable
      markets will operate the transmission networks, and provide related services,
      efficiently.

Disruptions
      in
      Our Fuel Supplies Could Occur, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to
      Operate Our Generation Facilities

We
      purchase fuel
      from a number of suppliers. The lack of availability of fuel, or a disruption
      in
      the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of weather, increased
      transportation costs or other difficulties, labor relations or environmental
      or
      other regulations affecting our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our
      ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and/or
      higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of
      operations.

Seasonal
      Temperature Variations, as well as Weather Conditions or other Natural Disasters
      Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Results of Operations Specifically with
      Respect to Our PLR Contracts that do not Provide for a Specific Level of Supply,
      and Demand Significantly Below or Above our Forecasts Could Adversely Affect
      our
      Energy Margins

Weather
      conditions
      directly influence the demand for electric power. In our service areas, demand
      for power peaks during the summer months, with market prices also typically
      peaking at that time. As a result, overall operating results may fluctuate
      on a
      seasonal and quarterly basis. In addition, we have historically sold less power,
      and consequently received less revenue, when weather conditions are milder.
      Severe weather, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, ice or snow storms or droughts
      or
      other natural disasters, may cause outages and property damage that may require
      us to incur additional costs that are generally not insured and that may not
      be
      recoverable from customers. The effect of the failure of our facilities to
      operate as planned under these conditions would be particularly burdensome
      during a peak demand period.

Demand
      that we
      satisfy pursuant to our PLR contracts could increase as a result of severe
      weather conditions, economic development or other reasons over which we have
      no
      control. We satisfy our electricity supply obligations through a portfolio
      approach of providing electricity from our generation assets, contractual
      relationships and market purchases. A significant increase in demand would
      adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms
      of
      the PLR contracts to provide the energy supply to fulfill this increased demand
      at capped rates, which we expect to remain significantly below the wholesale
      prices at which we would have to purchase the additional supply if needed or,
      if
      we had available capacity, the prices at which we could otherwise sell the
      additional supply. Accordingly, any significant change in demand could have
      a
      material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.


We
      Are Subject
      to Financial Performance Risks Related to the Economic Cycles of the Electric
      Utility Industry

Our
      business follows
      the economic cycles of our customers. Sustained downturns or sluggishness in
      the
      economy generally affects the markets in which we operate and negatively
      influences our energy operations. Declines in demand for electricity as a result
      of economic downturns will reduce overall electricity sales and lessen our
      cash
      flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production, resulting in less
      consumption of electricity. Economic conditions also impact the rate of
      delinquent customer accounts receivable.

The
      Goodwill of
      One or More of Our Operating Subsidiaries May Become Impaired, Which Would
      Result in Write-Offs of the Impaired Amounts

There
      is a
      possibility that additional goodwill may be impaired at one or more of our
      operating subsidiaries. The actual timing and amounts of any goodwill
      impairments in future years would depend on many uncertain variables, including
      changing interest rates, utility sector market performance, our capital
      structure, market prices for power, results of future rate proceedings,
      operating and capital expenditure requirements and other factors.

We
      Face Certain
      Human Resource Risks Associated with the Availability of Trained and Qualified
      Labor to Meet Our Future Staffing Requirements

Workforce
      demographic issues challenge employers nationwide and are of particular concern
      to the electric utility industry. The median age of utility workers is
      significantly higher than the national average. Today, nearly one-half of the
      industry's workforce is age 45 or older. Consequently, we face the difficult
      challenge of finding ways to retain our aging skilled workforce while recruiting
      new talent to mitigate losses in critical knowledge and skills due to
      retirements. Mitigating these risks could require additional financial
      commitments.

Significant
      Increases in Our Operation and Maintenance Expenses, Including Our Health Care
      and Pension Costs, Could Adversely Affect Our Future Earnings and
      Liquidity

We
      continually focus
      on limiting, and reducing where possible, our operation and maintenance
      expenses. However, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures,
      including health care and pension costs. We have experienced significant health
      care cost inflation in the last few years, and we expect our health care costs,
      including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures
      that we have taken and expect to continue to take to require employees and
      retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits.
      The measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations,
      costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, many
      of
      which relate to factors beyond our control. These assumptions include investment
      returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements, salary
      increases and the demographics of plan participants. If our assumptions prove
      to
      be inaccurate, our costs could be significantly increased.

Acts
      of War or
      Terrorism Could Negatively Impact Our Business

The
      possibility that
      our infrastructure, or that of an interconnected company, such as electric
      generation, transmission and distribution facilities could be direct targets
      of,
      or indirect casualties of, an act of war or terrorism could affect our
      operations. Our generation plants, transmission and distribution facilities,
      or
      those of interconnected companies, may be targets of terrorist activities that
      could result in disruption of our ability to generate, purchase, transmit or
      distribute electricity. Any such disruption could result in a decrease in
      revenues and additional costs to purchase electricity and to replace or repair
      our assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of
      operations and financial condition.

Risks
      Associated With Regulation

Complex
      and
      Changing Government Regulations Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Results
      of
      Operations

We
      are subject to
      comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies
      that significantly influence our operating environment. Changes in or
      reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations or the imposition of new
      laws
      or regulations could require us to incur additional costs or change the way
      we
      conduct our business, and therefore could have an adverse impact on our results
      of operations.


Regulatory
      Changes in the Electric Industry Including a Reversal, Discontinuance or Delay
      of the Present Trend Towards Competitive Markets Could Affect Our Competitive
      Position and Result in Unrecoverable Costs Adversely Affecting Our Business
      and
      Results of Operations

As
      a result of the
      actions taken by state legislative bodies over the last few years, changes
      in
      the electric utility business have occurred and are continuing to take place
      throughout the United States, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
      These
      changes have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in fundamental
      alterations in the way integrated utilities conduct their business.

Some
      deregulated
      electricity markets have experienced difficulty in transition to market. In
      some
      of these markets, both state and federal government agencies and other
      interested parties have made proposals to delay market restructuring or even
      re-regulate areas of these markets that have previously been deregulated. For
      example, in 2001, the FERC instituted a series of price controls designed to
      mitigate (or cap) prices in the entire western U.S. to address the extreme
      volatility in the California electricity markets. These price controls have
      had
      the effect of significantly reducing spot and forward electricity prices in
      the
      western market. In addition, the ISOs that oversee the transmission systems
      in
      certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to time been authorized
      to
      impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the
      power
      markets. Similar types of price limitations and other mechanisms could reduce
      the profits that our wholesale power marketing business would have realized
      based on competitive market conditions absent such limitations and mechanisms.
      Although we expect the deregulated electricity markets to continue to be
      competitive, other proposals to re-regulate our industry may be made, and
      legislative or other action affecting the electric power restructuring process
      may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued or reversed in the states
      in
      which we currently, or may in the future, operate. Such delays, discontinuations
      or reversals of electricity market restructurings in the markets in which we
      operate could have an impact on our results of operations and financial
      condition. At a minimum, these types of actions raise uncertainty concerning
      the
      continued development of competitive power markets.

The
      FERC and the
      U.S. Congress propose changes from time to time in the structure and conduct
      of
      the electric utility industry. If the restructuring and deregulation efforts
      result in increased competition or unrecoverable costs, our business and results
      of operations may be adversely affected. We cannot predict the extent or timing
      of further efforts to restructure, deregulate or re-regulate our business or
      the
      industry.

Our
      Profitability is Impacted by Our Affiliated Companies' Continued Authorization
      to Sell Power at Market-Based Rates

In
      2005 the FERC
      granted FES, FGCO and NGC authority to sell electricity at market-based rates.
      The FERC's orders that grant this market-based rate authority reserve the right
      to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that
      these companies can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create
      barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. As a condition
      to
      the orders granting these generating companies market-based rate authority,
      every three years they are required to file a market power update to show that
      they continue to meet the FERC's standards with respect to generation market
      power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities qualify for
      market-based rates. They will be required to renew this authority in 2008.
      If
      any of these companies were to lose its market-based rate authority or fail
      to
      have such authority renewed, it would be required to obtain the FERC's
      acceptance to sell power at cost-based rates. That company then would become
      subject to the accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements that are
      imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules.

The
      FERC has issued
      a proposed rulemaking to revise the standards used to determine whether an
      applicant qualifies for market-based authority. In addition, the FERC is
      considering modifications to other aspects of its market-based rate
      authorizations, including whether to continue granting waivers of FERC's
      accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on
      utilities with cost-based rates, whether to continue granting blanket approval
      for future securities issuances or assumptions of liabilities to entities with
      market-based rate authority, whether to adopt a uniform tariff that applies
      to
      all market-based rate sellers, and whether to modify the approach to the
      three-year market power update filing. The FERC has solicited comments from
      interested parties on these and other issues. The outcome of this proposed
      rulemaking proceeding could affect the regulatory requirements applicable to
      FES, FGCO, and NGC as market-based rate sellers.

The
      Amount We
      Charge Third Parties for Using Our Transmission Facilities May be Reduced and
      not Recovered.

In
      July 2003, the
      FERC issued an order directing PJM and the MISO to make compliance filings
      to
      eliminate the transaction-based charges for RTOR transmission service on
      transactions where the energy is delivered within the proposed MISO and PJM
      expanded regions (Combined Footprint). The elimination of the T&O rates
      reduces the transmission service revenues collected by the RTOs and thereby
      reduces the revenues received by transmission owners under the RTOs' revenue
      distribution protocols. To mitigate the impact of lost RTOR revenues, the FERC
      approved SECA transition rates beginning in December 2004 and extending through
      March 2006.


A
      hearing in the
      SECA case was held in May 2006 to determine whether any of the SECA revenues
      should be refunded. In August 2006, the ALJ issued an initial decision, finding
      that the rate design for the recovery of SECA charges was flawed and that a
      large portion of the "lost revenues" reflected in the SECA rates were not
      recoverable. The ALJ found that the SECA rates charged were unfair, unjust
      and
      discriminatory, and that new compliance filings and refunds should be made.
      The
      ALJ also found that unpaid SECA rates must be paid in the recommended reduced
      amount.

Although
      we believe
      we have meritorious arguments, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome
      of
      any future FERC proceedings or court appeals. If the FERC adopts the ALJ's
      decision, it could have an impact on our future results of operations and cash
      flows. Also, management is unable to predict whether the FERC will approve
      either the ALJ's decision or when, or if, the effect of the loss of RTOR/SECA
      transmission revenues will be recoverable in the state retail jurisdictions
      and/or from transmission users within the PJM region. Therefore, the final
      amount of our SECA obligations, if any, remains uncertain.

There
      Are
      Uncertainties Relating to Our Participation in the PJM and MISO Regional
      Transmission Organizations

Market
      rules that
      govern the operation of RTOs could affect our ability to sell power produced
      by
      our generating facilities to users in certain markets due to transmission
      constraints and attendant congestion costs. The prices in day-ahead and
      real-time RTO markets have been subject to price volatility. Administrative
      costs imposed by RTOs, including the cost of administering energy markets,
      have
      also increased. The rules governing the various regional power markets may
      also
      change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues. We are
      incurring significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in
      an
      RTO, and may be limited by state retail rate caps with respect to the price
      at
      which power can be sold to retail customers. While RTO rates for transmission
      service are designed to be revenue neutral, our revenues from customers to
      whom
      we currently provide transmission services may not reflect all of the
      administrative and market-related costs imposed under the RTO tariff due to
      state retail rate caps. In addition, we may be required to expand our
      transmission system according to decisions made by an RTO rather than our
      internal planning process. Because it remains unclear which companies will
      be
      participating in the various regional power markets, or how RTOs will ultimately
      develop and operate or what region they will cover, we cannot fully assess
      the
      impact that these power markets or other ongoing RTO developments may have.

Costs
      of
      Compliance with Environmental Laws are Significant, and the Cost of Compliance
      with Future Environmental Laws Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow and
      Profitability

Certain of our subsidiaries' operations are subject to extensive federal, state
      and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations. Compliance with these
      legal requirements requires us to incur costs toward environmental monitoring,
      installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, maintenance,
      upgrading, remediation and permitting at all of our facilities. These
      expenditures have been significant in the past and may increase in the future.
      If the cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations
      does
      increase, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations,
      financial position and cash flows. Moreover, changes in environmental laws
      or
      regulations may materially increase our costs of compliance or accelerate the
      timing of capital expenditures. Because of the deregulation of generation,
      we
      may not directly recover through rates additional costs incurred for such
      compliance. Our compliance strategy, although reasonably based on available
      information, may not successfully address future relevant standards and
      interpretations. If FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries fail to comply with
      environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond our control
      or new interpretations of longstanding requirements, that failure could result
      in the assessment of civil or criminal liability and fines. In addition, any
      alleged violation of environmental laws and regulations may require us to expend
      significant resources to defend against any such alleged
      violations.

Also, we are generally responsible for on-site liabilities, and in some
      cases off-site liabilities, associated with the environmental condition of
      our
      facilities which we have acquired or developed, regardless of when the
      liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with
      some
      acquisitions and sales of assets, we may obtain, or be required to provide,
      indemnification against some environmental liabilities. If we incur a material
      liability, or the other party to a transaction fails to meet its indemnification
      obligations to us, we could suffer material losses.

The EPA's final CAIR, CAMR and CAVR require significant reductions beginning
      in
      2009 in air emissions from coal-fired power plants and the states have been
      given substantial discretion in developing their own rules to implement these
      programs. In addition, both the CAIR and the CAMR have been challenged in the
      United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. As a result, the
      ultimate requirements under these air emission reduction programs may not be
      known for several years and may differ significantly from the current rules.
      If
      the final rules are remanded by the Court of Appeals, if states elect not to
      participate in the various federal programs under the rules, or if the states
      elect to impose additional requirements on individual units that are already
      subject to the CAIR, the CAMR and/or the CAVR, costs of compliance could
      increase significantly and could have an adverse effect on future results of
      operations, cash flows and financial condition. Alternatively, if the final
      rules are remanded by the Court and their implementation is postponed, we could
      be competitively disadvantaged because we are currently obligated to comply
      with
      essentially this same level of emission controls as a result of our settlement
      of the New Source Review Litigation related to our W. H. Sammis Plant.


There
      also is
      growing concern nationally and internationally about global warming. Further,
      many states and environmental groups have also challenged certain of the federal
      laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being sufficiently strict.
      As a result, it is possible that state and federal regulations will be developed
      that will impose more stringent limitations on emissions than are currently
      in
      effect. Any such additional limitations on emissions may require us to make
      increased expenditures for pollution control devices which could have an adverse
      impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Various water quality regulations, the majority of which are the result of
      the
      federal Clean Water Act and its amendments, apply to FirstEnergy's plants.
      In
      addition, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have water quality standards
      applicable to FirstEnergy's operations. As provided in the Clean Water Act,
      authority to grant federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
      water
      discharge permits can be assumed by a state. Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania
      have assumed such authority.

We
      are and may
      Become Subject to Legal Claims Arising from the Presence of Asbestos or Other
      Regulated Substances at Some of our Facilities

We have been named as a defendant in pending asbestos litigation involving
      multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants. In addition, asbestos and other
      regulated substances are, and may continue to be, present at our facilities
      where suitable alternative materials are not available. We believe that any
      remaining asbestos at our facilities is contained. The continued presence of
      asbestos and other regulated substances at these facilities, however, could
      result in additional actions being brought against us.

The
      Continuing
      Availability and Operation of Generating Units is Dependent on Retaining the
      Necessary Licenses, Permits, and Operating Authority from Governmental Entities,
      Including the NRC

We
      are required to
      have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the agencies that
      regulate our business. We believe the necessary permits, approvals and
      certificates have been obtained for our existing operations and that our
      business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, we are unable
      to predict the impact on operating results from future regulatory activities
      of
      any of these agencies and we are not assured that any such permits, approvals
      or
      certifications will be renewed.

We
      May
      Ultimately Incur Liability in Connection with Federal
      Proceedings

On
      October 20,
      2004, FirstEnergy was notified by the SEC that the previously disclosed informal
      inquiry initiated by the SEC's Division of Enforcement in September 2003
      relating to the restatements in August 2003 of previously reported results
      by
      FirstEnergy and the Ohio Companies, and the Davis-Besse extended outage, have
      become the subject of a formal order of investigation. The SEC's formal order
      of
      investigation also encompasses issues raised during the SEC's examination of
      FirstEnergy and the Companies under the PUHCA. Concurrent with this
      notification, FirstEnergy received a subpoena asking for background documents
      and documents related to the restatements and Davis-Besse issues. On December
      30, 2004, FirstEnergy received a subpoena asking for documents relating to
      issues raised during the SEC's PUHCA examination. On August 24, 2005,
      additional information was requested regarding Davis-Besse. FirstEnergy has
      cooperated fully with the informal inquiry and will continue to do so with
      the
      formal investigation.

Risks
      Associated With Financing and Capital Structure

Interest
      Rates
      and/or a Credit Ratings Downgrade Could Negatively Affect Our Financing Costs
      and Our Ability to Access Capital

We
      have near-term
      exposure to interest rates from outstanding indebtedness indexed to variable
      interest rates, and we have exposure to future interest rates to the extent
      we
      seek to raise debt in the capital markets to meet maturing debt obligations
      and
      fund construction or other investment opportunities. Interest rates could change
      in significant ways as a result of economic or other events that our risk
      management processes were not established to address. As a result, we cannot
      always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us
      if
      actual events lead to greater losses or costs than our risk management positions
      were intended to hedge. Although we employ risk management techniques to hedge
      against interest rate volatility, significant and sustained increases in market
      interest rates could materially increase our financing costs and negatively
      impact our reported results.


We
      rely on access to
      bank and capital markets as sources of liquidity for cash requirements not
      satisfied by cash flows from operations. A downgrade in our credit ratings
      from
      the nationally-recognized credit rating agencies, particularly to a level below
      investment grade, could negatively affect our ability to access the bank and
      capital markets, especially in a time of uncertainty in either of those markets,
      and may require us to post cash collateral to support outstanding commodity
      positions in the wholesale market, as well as in place of letters of credit
      and
      other guarantees. A ratings downgrade would also increase the fees we pay on
      our
      various credit facilities, thus increasing the cost of our working capital.
      A
      ratings downgrade could also impact our ability to grow our businesses by
      substantially increasing the cost of, or limiting access to, capital. Our senior
      unsecured debt ratings from S&P, Moody's, and Fitch are investment grade.
      The current ratings outlook from S&P is stable and the ratings outlook from
      Moody's is positive. Fitch's ratings outlook is positive for CEI and TE and
      stable for all other subsidiaries and FirstEnergy.

A
      rating is not a
      recommendation to buy, sell or hold debt, inasmuch as such rating does not
      comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor. The ratings
      assigned to our debt address the likelihood of payment of principal and interest
      pursuant to their terms. A rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal
      at
      any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated
      independently of any other rating that may be assigned to our securities.

We
      Must Rely on
      Cash from Our Subsidiaries

We
      are a holding
      company and our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.
      Substantially all of our business is conducted by our subsidiaries.
      Consequently, our cash flow is dependent on the operating cash flows of our
      subsidiaries and their ability to upstream cash to the holding company. Our
      utility subsidiaries are regulated by various state utility commissions that
      generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of utility customers
      are
      being met. Those state commissions could attempt to impose restrictions on
      the
      ability of our utility subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise restrict
      cash
      payments to us.

We
      Cannot Assure
      Common Shareholders that Future Dividend Payments Will be Made, or if Made,
      in
      What Amounts they May be Paid

Our
      Board of
      Directors regularly evaluates our common stock dividend policy and determines
      the dividend rate each quarter. The level of dividends will continue to be
      influenced by many factors, including, among other things, our earnings,
      financial condition and cash flows from subsidiaries, as well as general
      economic and competitive conditions. We cannot assure common shareholders that
      dividends will be paid in the future, or that, if paid, dividends will be at
      the
      same amount or with the same frequency as in the past.

Evaluation
      of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

FirstEnergy's
      Chief
      Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated such
      registrant's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in the Securities
      Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of the end date covered
      by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and

      procedures were effective as of December 31, 2006.

Management's
      Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management

      responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
      financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange
      Act
      of 1934. Using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
      Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated
      Framework, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
      FirstEnergy's internal control over financial reporting under the supervision
      of
      FirstEnergy's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on
      that
      evaluation, management concluded that FirstEnergy's internal control over
      financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. Management's
      assessment of the effectiveness of FirstEnergy's internal control over financial
      reporting, as of December 31, 2006, has been audited by
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
      as
      stated in their report included in FirstEnergy's 2006 Annual Report to
      Stockholders and incorporated by reference hereto.

Changes
      in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
      were no
      changes in FirstEnergy's internal control over financial reporting during the
      fourth quarter of 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
      to materially affect, FirstEnergy's internal control over financial
      reporting.
