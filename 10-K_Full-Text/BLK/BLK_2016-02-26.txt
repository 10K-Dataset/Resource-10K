BlackRock, Inc.


Part I

Item 1. Business

Overview

BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $4.645 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2015. With employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and risk management services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.

Our diverse platform of active (alpha) and index (beta) investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Our product offerings include single- and multi-asset class portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds,

iShares

®

exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), separate accounts, collective investment funds and other pooled investment vehicles. We also offer our

BlackRock Solutions

®

(“BRS”) investment and risk management technology platform,

Aladdin

®

, risk analytics and advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional investors. The Company is highly regulated and serves its clients as a fiduciary. We do not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of our clients.

BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail investors.

BlackRock maintains a significant global sales and marketing presence that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through financial professionals and pension consultants, and establishing third-party distribution relationships.

BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and over two-thirds of its Board of Directors consisting of independent directors. At December 31, 2015, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) held 21.1% of BlackRock’s voting common stock and 22.2% of BlackRock’s capital stock, which includes outstanding common stock and nonvoting preferred stock.

Management seeks to achieve attractive returns for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on the following factors:

•

the Company’s focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for index products;

•

the Company’s global reach and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 48% of employees outside the United States supporting local investment capabilities and serving clients, and approximately 42% of total AUM managed for clients domiciled outside the United States;

•

the Company’s diversified active and index product offerings, which enhance its ability to offer a variety of traditional and alternative investment products across the risk spectrum and to tailor single- and multi-asset investment solutions to address specific client needs;

•

the Company’s differentiated client relationships and fiduciary focus, which enable effective positioning toward changing client needs and macro trends including the secular shift to passive investing and ETFs, a focus on income and retirement, and barbelling of risk using index and active products, including alternatives; and

•

the Company’s longstanding commitment to risk management and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BRS products and services.

BlackRock operates in a global marketplace characterized by a high degree of market volatility and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.

The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in BRS products and services. New business efforts depend on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives in a manner consistent with their risk preferences and to deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the Company’s long-term success.


Financial Highlights

N/A

— not applicable

(1)

Net of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) (redeemable and nonredeemable).

(2)

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures.

See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures, for further information on non-GAAP financial measures and for as adjusted items for 2015, 2014, and 2013. In 2012, operating income, as adjusted, included an adjustment related to estimated lease exit costs initially recorded in 2011 and the contribution to certain of the Company’s bank-managed short-term investment funds (“STIFs”).  In 2011, operating income, as adjusted, included U.K. lease exit costs which represent costs to exit two locations in London and restructuring charges. In 2012 and 2011, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately did not impact BlackRock’s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense).

(3)

Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted exclude the after-tax impact of the items listed above and also include the effect on deferred income tax expense resulting from certain income tax matters.

Percentage represents CAGR over a five-year period (2010-2015).

Component changes in AUM by product type for the five years ended December 31, 2015 are presented below.

(1)

Amounts include AUM acquired from Claymore Investments, Inc. (“Claymore”) in March 2012, Swiss Re Private Equity Partners (“SRPEP”) in September 2012, Credit Suisse’s ETF franchise (“Credit Suisse ETF Transaction”) in July 2013 and MGPA in October 2013.  Amounts also include AUM acquired in the acquisitions of certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors LLC (“BKCA”) in March 2015, Infraestructura Institucional and FutureAdvisor in October 2015, and other reclassifications to conform to current period combined AUM policy and presentation. Amounts also include Barclays Global Investors merger-related outflows due to manager concentration considerations prior to the third quarter of 2011 and outflows from scientific active equity performance prior to the second quarter of 2011. As a result of


client investment manager concentration limits and the scientific active equity performance, outflows were expected to occur for a period of time subsequent to the close of the transaction.

(2)

Percentage represents CAGR over a five-year period (2010-2015).

AUM represents the broad range of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.

Investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of AUM. We also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, we also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary

Aladdin

investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing and advisory services, to institutional investors under the BRS name. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives.

At December 31, 2015, total AUM was $4.645 trillion, representing a CAGR of 5% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including Claymore and SRPEP, which collectively added $13.7 billion of AUM in 2012, Credit Suisse and MGPA, which collectively added $26.9 billion of AUM in 2013 and BKCA, Infraestructura Institucional and FutureAdvisor, which collectively added $2.2 billion of AUM in 2015. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below.

The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company’s AUM will be organized as follows:

Client Type

Our organizational structure was designed to ensure that strong investment performance is our highest priority, and that we best align with our clients’ needs to capitalize on broader industry trends. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent.

Specifically, our investments functions are split into distinct strategies: Active Equity and Fixed Income, Beta, Multi-Asset, Alternatives and Trading/Liquidity.

We serve a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail investors.

AUM by investment style and client type at December 31, 2015 is presented below.

Retail

BlackRock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the active and passive spectrum, including separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Clients invest primarily in mutual funds, which totaled $446.4 billion, or 83%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts (“SMAs”). The majority (92%) of long-term retail AUM is invested in active products, although this is impacted by

being shown separately. Retail represented 13% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2015 and 35% of long-term base fees for 2015.

The retail client base is diversified geographically, with 70% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 24% in EMEA and 6% in Asia-Pacific at year-end 2015.

•

U.S. retail

long-term net inflows of $18.7 billion, or 5% organic growth, were led by fixed income net inflows of $20.9 billion. Fixed income net inflows were diversified across exposures and products, with strong flows into our unconstrained, high yield and core bond offerings. Equity net inflows of $1.3 billion were driven by flows into our index mutual funds, and we continued to make progress on the reinvigoration and globalization of our fundamental active equity business. Multi-asset class net outflows of $2.5 billion were primarily due to a large single-client transition out of mutual funds into a series of

iShares

across asset classes.

•

International retail

long-term net inflows of $19.8 billion, representing 12% organic growth, were positive across major regions and diversified across asset classes. Fixed income products generated net inflows of $10.3 billion, led by short duration and unconstrained strategies as investors looked to manage duration and generate yield in their portfolios. Multi-asset class net inflows of $1.2 billion were driven by flows into managed volatility strategies and the cross-border version of our Multi-Asset Income fund. Equity net inflows of $7.2 billion reflected strong flows into international equities. Alternatives net inflows totaled $1.2 billion, and we remain committed to broadening the distribution of alternatives funds to bring institutional quality alternatives to retail investors.

iShares

iShares

is the leading ETF provider in the world, with $1.1 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2015 and was the top asset gatherer globally in 2015


with $129.9 billion of net inflows for an organic growth rate of 13%. Equity net inflows of $78.4 billion were driven by flows into the Core Series and into funds with broad developed market equity exposures, partially offset by outflows from emerging market products. Record fixed income net inflows of $50.3 billion were diversified across exposures and product lines, led by flows into core, corporate and high yield bond funds.

iShares

multi-asset class and alternatives funds contributed a combined $1.2 billion of net inflows, primarily into core allocation funds.

Institutional active

AUM ended 2015 at $962.9 billion, reflecting $26.8 billion of net inflows. Institutional active represented 22% of long-term AUM and 20% of long-term base fees. Growth in AUM reflected continued strength in multi-asset class products with net inflows of $18.4 billion reflecting ongoing demand for solutions offerings and the

LifePath

target-date suite. Our top-performing fixed income platform generated net inflows of $5.7 billion,

diversified across exposures. Alternatives net inflows of $3.1 billion were led by inflows into infrastructure and alternatives solutions offerings. In addition, 2015 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, and we raised over $5 billion in new commitments, which will be a source of future net inflows. Equity net outflows of $0.5 billion reflected fundamental net outflows of $2.2 billion, which were partially offset by scientific net inflows of $1.7 billion.

Institutional index

AUM totaled $1.739 trillion at December 31, 2015, reflecting net outflows of $43.1 billion. Equity net outflows of $33.7 billion were primarily due to low-fee global and regional index equity outflows as clients looked to re-allocate, re-balance or meet their cash needs. Fixed income net outflows of $10.2 billion were concentrated in local currency mandates, linked to outflows from liability management strategies. Institutional index represented 40% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2015 and accounted for 10% of long-term base fees for 2015.

The Company’s institutional clients consist of the following:

•

Pensions, Foundations and Endowments.

BlackRock is among the world’s largest managers of pension plan assets with $1.847 trillion, or 68%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2015. The market landscape is shifting from defined benefit to defined contribution, driving strong flows in our defined contribution channel, which had $36.2 billion of long-term net inflows for the year, or 6% organic growth, driven by continued demand for our

LifePath

target-date suite. Defined contribution represented $630.9 billion of total pension AUM, and we remain well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $52.8 billion, or 2% of long-term institutional AUM, was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.

•

Official Institutions.

We also managed $185.0 billion, or 7%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2015. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.

•

Financial and Other Institutions.

BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $237.7 billion, or 9%, of institutional long-term AUM at year-end 2015. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $379.4 billion, or 14%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.


Product Type

Component changes in AUM by product type and investment style for 2015 are presented below.

(1)

Amounts represent $1.3 billion of AUM acquired in the BKCA acquisition in March 2015, $560 million of AUM acquired in the Infraestructura Institucional acquisition in October 2015 and $366 million of AUM acquired in the FutureAdvisor acquisition in October 2015. The FutureAdvisor acquisition amount does not include AUM that was held in

iShares

holdings.

Long-term product offerings include active and index strategies. Our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile. We offer two types of active strategies: those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index strategies include both our non-ETF index products and

iShares

ETFs.

Although many clients use both active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. This has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.

Equity

Year-end 2015 equity AUM totaled $2.424 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $52.8 billion. Net inflows included $78.4 billion and $4.2 billion into

iShares

and active products, respectively.

iShares

net inflows were driven by the Core Series and flows into broad developed market equity exposures, and active net inflows reflected demand for international equities.

iShares

and active net inflows were partially offset by non-ETF index net outflows of $29.8 billion.

BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than U.S. equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which do not consistently move in tandem with U.S. markets, may have a greater impact on BlackRock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues.

Fixed Income

Fixed income AUM ended 2015 at $1.422 trillion, increasing $28.7 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2014. The increase in AUM reflected $76.9 billion in net inflows, partially offset by $48.2 billion in net market depreciation and foreign exchange movements. In 2015, active net inflows of $35.9 billion were diversified across fixed income offerings, with strong flows into our unconstrained, total return and high yield strategies. Flagship funds in these product areas include our unconstrained Strategic Income Opportunities and Fixed Income Strategies funds, with net inflows of $7.0 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively; our Total Return fund with net inflows of $2.7 billion; and our High Yield Bond fund with net inflows of $3.5 billion. Fixed income

iShares

net inflows of $50.3 billion were led by flows into core, corporate and high yield bond funds.  Active and

iShares

net inflows were partially offset by non-ETF index net outflows of $9.3 billion.

Multi-Asset Class

BlackRock’s multi-asset class team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.


Component changes in multi-asset class AUM for 2015 are presented below.

(1)

Amounts represent $366 million of AUM acquired in the FutureAdvisor acquisition in October 2015. The FutureAdvisor acquisition amount does not include AUM that was held in

iShares

holdings.

Multi-asset class net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $17.4 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows, and contributed $7.3 billion to institutional multi-asset class net new business in 2015, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings. Retail net outflows of $1.3 billion were primarily due to a large single-client transition out of mutual funds into a series of

iShares

across asset classes. Notwithstanding this transition, retail flows reflected demand for our Multi-Asset Income fund family, which raised $4.6 billion in 2015.

The Company’s multi-asset class strategies include the following:

•

Asset allocation and balanced products

represented 49% of multi-asset class AUM at year-end, with growth in AUM driven by net new business of $12.9 billion. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products in this category include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income suites.

•

Target date and target risk product

flows were impacted by a large single-client transition out of mutual funds into a series of

iShares

across asset classes. Institutional investors represented 95% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans accounting for over 88% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our

LifePath

and

LifePath Retirement Income

®

offerings.

LifePath

products utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing.

•

Fiduciary management services

are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management. These customized services require strong partnership with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.

•

FutureAdvisor

is a leading digital wealth management platform, acquired by BlackRock in October 2015. FutureAdvisor operates as a service within BRS, providing financial institutions with high quality, technology-enabled advice capabilities to improve their clients’ investment experience. As consumers increasingly engage with technology to invest, BlackRock and FutureAdvisor are positioned to empower distribution partners to better serve their clients by combining FutureAdvisor’s high-quality technology-enabled advice with BlackRock’s multi-asset investment capabilities, proprietary technology and risk analytics

Alternatives

BlackRock Alternative Investors (“BAI”) focuses on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into two main categories — 1) core, and 2) currency and commodities. Core includes alternative solutions, direct hedge funds, hedge fund and private equity solutions (funds of funds), opportunistic private equity and credit, real estate and infrastructure offerings. The products offered under the BAI umbrella are described below.

In 2015, BlackRock returned $3.3 billion of capital to investors, which is included in outflows. In addition, we raised $5.7 billion of new commitments in 2015 across a variety of strategies, including private equity solutions, opportunistic credit, alternative solutions, real estate and infrastructure. At year-end, we had $10.9 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years; these commitments are not included in AUM until they are invested.

We believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies, investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings.  As a top ten alternative provider


our highly diversified $112.8 billion alternatives franchise is well positioned to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors.

AUM in currency and commodities declined 11% from year-end 2014, reflecting portfolio valuation declines of $3.5 billion. Currency and commodities products include a range of active and passive products. Our

iShares

commodities products represented $12.5 billion of AUM and are not eligible for performance fees.

Cash Management

Cash management AUM totaled $299.9 billion at December 31, 2015, up $3.5 billion, or 1%, from year-end 2014. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros or British pounds. We generated net inflows of $7.5 billion during 2015, a period marked by a near zero interest rate environment. BlackRock is working to bring all U.S. money market funds into full compliance with new regulatory requirements in advance of the 2016 deadlines, and is actively repurposing and streamlining our product lineup to meet the future requirements of clients.  In Europe, we continue to be a market leader highlighted by our implementation of the reverse distribution mechanism in our euro funds when faced with negative rates.  In November 2015, BlackRock and Bank of America’s asset management business, BofA Global Capital Management (“BACM”) entered into an agreement to transfer to BlackRock investment management responsibilities for approximately $87 billion of AUM in cash products currently managed by BACM.  The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016, subject to customary approvals and closing conditions.

Our FMA group continued to post solid revenues, even as the business transitions from a “crisis management” emphasis to a more institutionalized advisory business model, with a strong focus on helping clients navigate and implement requirements for the evolving regulatory environment. Advisory AUM decreased to $10.2 billion, driven by $9.6 billion of planned client distributions reflecting our continued success in disposing of assets for clients at, or above, targeted levels.

At year-end, BRS served clients, including banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers and other institutional investors across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.

Securities Lending

Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for U.S. domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for U.S. domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.

Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $218 billion, up from $187 billion at year-end 2014. Liability spreads were generally flat compared to 2014 levels.

BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent.

Risk & Quantitative Analysis

Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.

COMPETITION

BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service.


Geographic Information

At December 31, 2015, BlackRock served clients in more than 100 countries across the globe, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. See Note 22,

Segment Information

, contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information.

Employees

At December 31, 2015, BlackRock had a total of approximately 13,000 employees, including approximately 6,200 located in offices outside the United States. Consistent with our commitment to continually expand and enhance our talent base to support our clients, we added approximately 800 employees during the year, including in strategic focus areas.

REGULATION

Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, trust customers of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), PNC and its bank subsidiaries and their customers and the financial system. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and bank holding companies and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock.

The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.

GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM

BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “DFA”) was signed into law in the U.S. The DFA is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions, many of which have been adopted. BlackRock has commenced a conformance program to address certain regulations adopted under the DFA, as well as financial reforms that have been introduced as part of the SEC’s investment company modernization initiatives.  The cost of these initial conformance activities have been absorbed by BlackRock; however, as the full extent of the DFA and other rules will only become evident over time, it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that the DFA, or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions, will have upon BlackRock’s business, financial condition, and operating activities.

Systemically Important Financial Institution Review

Both the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) working with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) are considering potential systemic risk related to asset management.  In July 2014, the FSOC issued a statement indicating that their review would focus on products and activities, and FSOC subsequently released a request for information addressing: market liquidity and fund redemption risk, the use of leverage, operational risk, and the resolution of asset managers including the transition of client assets. In June 2015, IOSCO issued a statement indicating they also favored a products and activities approach in their review of asset managers, and in July 2015, the FSB made a similar announcement.  In September 2015, the FSB released a statement indicating that their review would focus on: market liquidity and fund redemption risk, the use of leverage, securities lending practices, operational risk, and risks from pension funds and sovereign wealth funds.

Although FSOC, IOSCO and FSB have shifted from a focus on designating firms and/or funds as systemically important (i.e., G-SIFI or SIFI designations), the process is ongoing and may lead to designations in the future.  In the event that BlackRock receives a SIFI designation, under the DFA, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) is charged with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions and BlackRock could become subject to direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.  If BlackRock was designated a SIFI or G-SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced prudential, capital, supervisory and other requirements, such as risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements, concentration limits, a contingent capital requirement, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits and overall risk management requirements. Requirements such as these, which were designed to regulate banking institutions, would be extremely burdensome for BlackRock, unless they were modified to be applicable to an asset manager. No proposals have been made indicating how such measures would be adapted for asset managers, if at all.

Securities and Exchange Commission Review of Asset Managers

BlackRock’s business may also be impacted by Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulatory initiatives. The SEC and its staff continue to engage in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. During 2015, the SEC proposed, among other things: enhanced reporting by investment advisors, enhanced reporting on registered mutual funds, new rules for liquidity risk management in registered funds, and new rules governing the use of derivatives and leverage by registered investment companies and business development companies. Furthermore, in June 2015, the SEC issued a request for comments regarding practices related to exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), which is


widely expected to result in a future rulemaking.  The SEC has also indicated an intention to propose new rules for the stress testing of

registered investment companies and transition planning by asset managers, including the transfer of client assets.

The SEC’s focus has also been directed toward risk identification and controls in various areas, including the use of derivatives and other

trading practices

(as reflected in the SEC’s late December 2015 rule proposal described more particularly under”

–

Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives below

)

, cyber-security and the evaluation of systemic risks.

While these proposals have yet to be finali

zed into new rules, a

ny new rules, guidance or regulatory initiatives resulting from these efforts could

expose BlackRock to additional compliance

and reporting

costs and may require the Company to change how it operates its business

or manages funds

.

Money Market Fund Reform

In July 2014, the SEC adopted new rules designed to reform the regulatory structure governing money market funds (“MMFs”) and to address the perceived systemic risks that such funds present. The new rules, to which U.S. MMFs must conform by October 2016, require institutional prime and institutional municipal MMFs to employ a floating net asset value per share method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Retail MMFs may continue operating with a constant net asset value per share.  The rules also provide for new tools for institutional and retail MMFs’ boards designed to address market shocks, including liquidity fees and redemption gates. The new rules do not apply to government (non-municipal) MMFs, although such funds may “opt-in” to the new liquidity fee and redemption gate provisions if previously disclosed to investors. Implementation of these new rules requires the development of new or additional systems by BlackRock and the funds’ service providers.  BlackRock has commenced efforts to move its MMFs into compliance in advance of the deadline.  The impact of the rules that affect the structure of the funds on BlackRock’s business remains uncertain as clients must decide which products fit their investment needs.  The new rules will, however, affect certain of BlackRock’s funds’ investment strategies, portfolio liquidity and return potential.  The new rules will also result in changes to BlackRock’s existing U.S. MMFs and may reduce the attractiveness of certain U.S. MMFs to investors.

Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives

The SEC, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives.  Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, these limitations could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new reporting or compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions. In December 2015, the SEC proposed a new rule governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies that, if enacted, would represent a fundamental change in the nature of the SEC's regulations governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies. This proposal has the potential to require BlackRock to change or restrict certain investment strategies or practices for some investment companies and incur additional costs. In some circumstances the proposed rule could make certain products less competitive with other investment options in the marketplace, which could negatively impact assets under management.

Further, the full implementation of regulations under the DFA and similar regulations in the European Union (“EU”)  and other global jurisdictions relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives could impact the manner in which BlackRock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, increasing the costs of derivatives trading for BlackRock’s clients. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules also introduce new requirements for centrally clearing certain swaps transactions and for executing certain swaps transactions on or through CFTC or SEC-registered trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods).

Jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which BlackRock operates also have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. This includes the implementation of mandated central clearing of swaps in the EU and the implementation of trade reporting, documentation, central clearing and other requirements in various jurisdictions globally.

In the United States, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are already subject to the DFA central clearing and electronic trading venue requirements, with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in 2016 and beyond.  For swaps and security-based swaps that are not centrally cleared, U.S. bank regulators recently adopted rules that could require BlackRock-advised funds and accounts to post margin payments when trading with a swap dealer that is regulated by one of the U.S. bank regulators.  The CFTC also recently adopted similar margin rules applicable when trading non-cleared swaps with swap dealers who are not regulated by one of the U.S. bank regulators.  These rules have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients. In EMEA, central clearing requirements will be implemented in a phased manner and will apply to BlackRock funds and accounts beginning in the latter half of 2016. The new rules and regulations may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock’s operational and legal risks.

Regulation of Exchange Traded Funds

As a result of recent market volatility, regulators globally are examining the potential risks in ETFs, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. BlackRock and other large issuers of ETFs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to BlackRock, or at all.  Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the Company’s business.

Taxation

BlackRock’s businesses may be affected by new tax legislation or regulations, or the modification of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings, by U.S. or non-U.S. authorities. In particular, BlackRock may be impacted by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) and the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) which have introduced new investor onboarding, withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring persons with financial assets outside of the their tax residence country pay appropriate taxes. FATCA and CRS rules will impact both U.S. and


non-U.S. funds and subject BlackRock to additional administrative burdens. In many instances, bilateral Intergovernmental Agreements (“IGAs”) between the U.S. and the countries in which BlackRock does business will g

overn implementation of the new rules. While many of these IGAs have been put into place, others have yet to be concluded.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has also launched a base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) proposal that aims to rationalize tax treatment across jurisdictions. In October 2015, the OECD released its final BEPS package in an effort to curb the use of certain tax regimes and elements of tax planning, primarily in a cross-border context. The final package was endorsed by the G20 and is subject to implementation. In addition, in January 2016, the European Commission announced an Anti-Tax Avoidance Package (“EU Package”) for consideration by the European Parliament and Council, containing measures to regulate certain elements of tax planning and to boost tax transparency. Once implemented, the BEPS package and the EU Package could curtail the amount of investments channeled by, and have unintended taxation consequences for funds as well as BlackRock’s overall tax position, which could adversely affect BlackRock’s financial condition and that of its clients.

In addition, certain EU Member States, such as France and Italy, have enacted financial transaction taxes (“FTTs”) which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instruments and derivatives transactions. Several other Member States continue to discuss introducing FTTs. In general, any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would impact investors and would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets, could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that BlackRock manages in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products. An FTT could significantly increase the operational costs of BlackRock entering into, on behalf of its clients, securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to an FTT, which could adversely impact BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.

Lastly, the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities may review and challenge BlackRock’s historical tax positions. These challenges may result in adjustments to BlackRock’s tax position, or impact the timing or amount of taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition.

Volcker Rule

Provisions of the DFA referred to as the “Volcker Rule” place limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively “covered funds”). Because the Federal Reserve currently treats BlackRock as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC, BlackRock may be required to conform its activities to the requirements of the Volcker Rule. On December 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve announced a second extension to the Volcker Rule conformance period, giving banking entities until July 21, 2016, to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (“legacy covered funds”). The Federal Reserve also announced its intention to grant banking entities an additional one-year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017, to conform ownership interests in and relationships with these legacy covered funds.  The Volcker Rule’s restrictions may, among other things, limit BlackRock’s ability to invest in covered funds and require BlackRock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds, which could subject BlackRock to additional expense. The Volcker Rule may also require BlackRock to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in covered funds which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value, depending on market conditions. The Volcker Rule may also reduce the level of market making and liquidity activities of several of BlackRock’s trading counterparties, which may adversely impact the liquidity and, in some cases, the pricing of various financial instruments in which BlackRock client accounts invest. For a further discussion of the Volcker Rule, see “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Legal and Regulatory Risks.”

Revised Department of Labor (“DoL”) Fiduciary Rule

In April 2015, the DoL proposed a new regulation defining the term "fiduciary" for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) and the prohibited transaction exercise tax provisions of the IRS. The rule has been highly criticized by industry participants, particularly retail intermediaries, and BlackRock is engaging with the DoL, trade associations and industry participants in an effort to affect revisions to the proposed rule. To the extent the rule is enacted as written, it will require BlackRock to re-paper a number of its distribution relationships, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock’s distribution partners and may limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain useful services and education to its clients.

Markets in Financial Instruments Directives

BlackRock is also subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives in Europe.  For example, in the EU rules and regulations made under the current Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) regime (described more particularly under “— European Regulation” below) are in the process of being revised through implementation of the “MiFID II” package of measures made up of a recast Directive and a new Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation.  MiFID II, which was originally scheduled to come into effect in January 2017, but is now scheduled to come into effect in January 2018, will be implemented through a number of Implementing and Regulatory Technical Standards to be made through Delegated Acts made by the European Commission following advice from the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”). MiFID II will build upon many of the measures introduced by MiFID, and will extend investor protection, trading transparency, clearing and trading venue access and reporting requirements. It is expected that MiFID II will have significant and wide-ranging impacts on EU securities and derivatives markets. In particular, there will be (i) enhanced governance and investor protection standards, (ii) prescriptive rules on portfolio management firms’ ability to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes, (iii) enhanced regulation of algorithmic trading, (iv) the movement of trading in certain shares and derivatives on to regulated execution venues, (v) the extension of pre- and post-trade transparency requirements to wider categories of financial instruments, (vi) restrictions on the use of so-called dark pool trading, (vii) the creation of a new type of trading venue called the Organized Trading Facility for non-equity financial instruments, (viii) commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements, (ix) a move away from vertical silos in execution, clearing and settlement, (x) an enhanced role for ESMA in supervising EU securities and derivatives markets and (xi) new requirements regarding non-EU investment firms’ access to EU financial markets. Implementation of these measures will have direct and indirect impacts on BlackRock and its subsidiaries and may require significant changes to client servicing models.  A significant number of the impacts are yet to be determined because MiFID II contains a wide ranging and complex set of measures.


Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities

The EU has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”). The latest initiative in this area, UCITS V seeks to align the UCITS depositary regime, UCITS remuneration rules and regulators’ power to sanction for breaches of the UCITS Directive with the requirements of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”). UCITS V is required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state by March 18, 2016 though further implementing measures will only become effective in late 2016. Compliance with the updated UCITS directive will subject BlackRock to additional expenses associated with new depositary oversight and other organizational requirements.

Reform of European Retail Distribution

BlackRock must also comply with retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections, overhauling mutual fund fee structures by banning the payment of commissions to distributors and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector. The rules were originally introduced in the United Kingdom in 2012 and similar rules have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where BlackRock operates such as the Netherlands, and are under discussion elsewhere. Similarly, MiFID II will contain a ban on certain advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers. These rules will lead to greater fragmentation of distribution rules and may lead to changes to BlackRock’s client servicing and distribution models, in particular affecting the fees BlackRock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners.

EU Benchmarks Regulation

Political agreement on the EU Benchmarks Regulation was reached at the end of 2015. The Regulation provides the legislative framework to implement the 2013 IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks.  The scope of the Regulation is broad as it includes submission based benchmarks through to transaction based market indices. Proportionality is applied to create a stricter framework for the systemically relevant benchmarks such as LIBOR and EURIBOR. Although the Regulation creates a number of obligations on administrators of, and submitters to, benchmarks, it is less extensive as regards the obligations of users of benchmarks, such as asset managers. The Regulation formalizes due diligence procedures for users and implies other additional administrative requirements of users of third-party benchmarks. Managers using third-party and/or bespoke benchmarks to assess fund performance are also caught by the Regulation. It is expected that detailed rule-making underpinning the Regulation's framework will be developed during 2016 and implemented beginning in 2018. While it is not yet possible to assess the full effect of the Regulation on BlackRock's business, it may impose additional administrative and due diligence requirements on the Company, the burden of which is likely to increase as BlackRock makes additional enhancements to its indexing business.

Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) Proposed Rulemaking for Registered Investment Advisers

FinCEN has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Proposed Rule”) that would extend to a number of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, which are registered or required to be registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”), the requirement to establish anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity to FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the “Bank Secrecy Act”).  The Proposed Rule would extend to those BlackRock subsidiaries captured within the Bank Secrecy Act’s definition of “financial institutions”, which would require them to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  If enacted in its current form, the Proposed Rule would expose BlackRock to additional compliance costs.

Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) Asset Management Market Survey

As part of its strategic priorities, the FCA is undertaking a market study into the asset management sector. The aim of this study is to understand whether competition is working effectively to enable both institutional and retail investors to get value for money when purchasing asset management services. The FCA is interested in understanding whether there are any barriers to innovation or technological advances which may be preventing new ways of doing business that could benefit investors (Fintech). If the FCA concludes that competition is not working well, the FCA may intervene through rule-making, introducing firm-specific remedies or enforcement action, publishing general guidance or proposing enhanced industry self-regulation. BlackRock is one of 40 firms included in the study and is currently responding to an information request that consists of qualitative and quantitative data. The FCA is aiming to engage with firms throughout 2016 with the proposal to issue a draft report to the industry in the summer of 2016. The FCA expect to publish their final report in early 2017.

EXISTING U.S. REGULATION - OVERVIEW

BlackRock and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the DoL, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the CFTC and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies.

The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock and its affiliated companies. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.

BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on BlackRock’s activities and damage its


reputation. Furthermore, one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, was required to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the statute) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Boar

d (“MSRB”) as a result of SEC rules giving effect to a section of the DFA requiring such registration. The rules subject BTC to new and additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB.

BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”), collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), real estate funds, collective investment trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area.

Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA, and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DoL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under Title I of ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients.

BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) and/or commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”) with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of the DFA, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Two of BlackRock’s other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (“BRIL”) and BlackRock Execution Services, are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. BRIL is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and a member of the MSRB, subject to MSRB rules.

U.S. Banking Regulation

PNC is a bank holding company and regulated as a “financial holding company” by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”). As described in “Item 1-Business”, as of December 31, 2015 PNC owned approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock. Based on the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve currently takes the position that this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, thereby subjecting BlackRock to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to PNC, including the Volcker Rule. The supervision and regulation of PNC and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws are intended primarily for the protection of its banking subsidiaries, its depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the financial system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of PNC or BlackRock.

BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a financial holding company under the BHC Act. Investment management is an authorized activity, but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements, which in some cases are more restrictive than those BlackRock faces under applicable securities laws. BlackRock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory, administrative or other services, only to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations. Based on the Federal Reserve’s position that BlackRock is a nonbank subsidiary of PNC, the Federal Reserve has broad powers to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for BlackRock to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations, and there are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of PNC to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with BlackRock or its funds. PNC and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of BlackRock’s businesses. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over nonbank subsidiaries, including the power to prohibit them from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws, regulations and orders. The DFA strengthened the Federal Reserve’s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company’s nonbank subsidiaries.

Any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of PNC or one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed,” by any examination downgrade of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act.

One of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. BTC is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital adequacy, regulations governing fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC’s customers and not BTC, BlackRock and its affiliates, or BlackRock’s stockholders.

Regulation of Securities Lending Financing Transactions

In its 2014 Annual Report, the FSOC identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers who act as lending agents as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring. The Federal Reserve is also considering whether to impose specific margin or minimum haircut requirements for securities financing transactions (“SFTs”). In addition, in October 2015, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission’s proposal for a European regulation on the reporting and transparency of SFTs. The SFT regulation aims to improve the transparency surrounding SFTs and limit the perceived risks of SFTs by, among other things, requiring central reporting of SFTs, requiring disclosure of SFTs to investors and imposing minimum requirements relating to the difference in prices at which a market maker can buy and sell a security in SFTs. If the recent scrutiny of SFTs results in additional regulatory requirements or reporting obligations, BlackRock may be


required to introduce additional compliance measures, which will subject BlackRock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in BlackRock’s SFT activities, including po

tential adjustments to its activities as agent lender for its clients

.

EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION — OVERVIEW

BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by U.S. laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application.

Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business.

Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.

European Regulation

The FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). It also regulates those U.K. subsidiaries’ branches established in other European Union countries and the U.K. branches of certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) regulates one BlackRock U.K. insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services related business in the U.K. under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”). The FCA’s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock’s U.K.-regulated insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic based reviews in order to monitor BlackRock’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.

In addition, BlackRock’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by MiFID, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the wider EEA. MiFID, the scope of which is being enhanced through MiFID II (which is described more particularly under “— Global Regulatory Reform” above), sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock European subsidiaries must also comply with the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Mediation Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms (the Capital Requirements Directive). These include requirements on capital, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. The obligations introduced through these directives will have a direct effect on some of BlackRock’s European operations.

BlackRock’s EU-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to an EU regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (i) the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts since February 2014.

Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region

In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (“FIEL”) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (“JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activity which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Business Act.

In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws, and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries’ licenses in Australia.

The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (“SFO”) which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”). The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. Failure to comply with the applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC could result in the suspension or revocations of the licenses granted by the SFC.

BlackRock’s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector. Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices across the Asia-Pacific region, including in Singapore and South Korea. Regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.

Item 1A. R

isk Factors

As a leading investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, fiduciary and investment risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.

MARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS

Changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real estate, commodities, currency or other asset markets may cause assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline.

BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real estate, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests, could cause:

•

the value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease;

•

the withdrawal of funds from BlackRock’s products in favor of products offered by competitors;

•

the rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees;

•

an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or

•

a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.

The occurrence of any of these events may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.

BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from its investment advisory business. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock’s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of private investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove BlackRock as a fund’s investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its U.S. mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. BlackRock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be subject to reduction (including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors). In addition, if a number of BlackRock’s clients terminate their contracts, remove BlackRock from advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Increased competition may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

The investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, the level of fees charged, the quality and diversity of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Failure to maintain Aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.

The sophisticated risk analytics that BlackRock provides via the

Aladdin

technology platform to support investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients are an important element of BlackRock’s competitive success.

Aladdin’s

competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine sophisticated risk analytics with comprehensive portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform.  Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken

Aladdin’s

competitive position and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline.  In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in

Aladdin

.

The impairment or failure of other financial institutions may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

BlackRock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages to many different industries and counterparties, including brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose the products and accounts BlackRock manages to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may otherwise fail to meet their obligations. Any such impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts managed by BlackRock, which could lead to the loss of clients and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.


The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irr

espective of BlackRock’s performance.

Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns could affect its nonoperating income and could increase the volatility of its earnings.

At December 31, 2015, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $1.5 billion in its investments (see “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments”) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real estate, commodities or alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock’s earnings and may cause earnings to decline.

Acts of terror and the continued threat of terrorism, as well as increased geopolitical unrest could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism and acts of civil or international hostility, both within the United States and abroad, as well as ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, loss of life, property damage, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Acts of terror may also result in increased border security between countries which could adversely affect trade, impede growth and exacerbate refugee crises arising out of civil or international conflicts. Continued geopolitical unrest and terrorist activity that adversely affect the global economy or capital markets may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Risks Related to INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE

Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

The Company’s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:

•

client withdrawals in favor of better performing products;

•

client shifts from active to passive products which charge lower fees;

•

the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients;

•

the Company earning reduced, minimal or no performance fees;

•

an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or

•

a decrease in investment returns on seed and co-investment capital.

Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.

A portion of BlackRock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $621 million, or 5%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement pursuant to which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods, which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely impact product performance and client relationships.

BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment decisions and allocations, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on BlackRock’s business and reputation.

TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS

A failure in BlackRock’s operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

BlackRock’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover a significant portion of BlackRock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London and Gurgaon. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock’s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock’s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic or other catastrophic event in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth. Notwithstanding BlackRock’s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and/or sanctions.


A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial

losses that may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus, phishing scam or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information.

There have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information, as well as cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. BlackRock has been the target of attempted cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand to create fraudulent websites, and must continuously monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and cause financial losses. In addition, due to BlackRock’s interconnectivity with third-party vendors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock may be adversely affected if any of them are subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event. Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations and could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth

BlackRock relies on its ability to maintain a robust and secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the

Aladdin

platform.  The analytical capabilities of

Aladdin

depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into

Aladdin

analytical calculations.  The failure of these third parties to provide such data or information, or disruption of such information flows, could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients.

Operating risks associated with BlackRock’s securities lending program may result in client losses.

BlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of BlackRock’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from the risks of collateral investments), and BlackRock may be held liable for any failure to manage any such risks.

BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.

BlackRock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account. Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan.  BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2015 and subject to indemnification was $169.3 billion. BlackRock held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $179.6 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2015. Significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

BlackRock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time support investment products through capital or other credit support. Such support may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses on such support, as well as regulatory restrictions on the Company’s ability to provide such support or the failure to have available or devote sufficient capital or liquidity to support products, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.

BlackRock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its ability to maintain and grow AUM, its creditworthiness and operating cash flows. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.


Fraud, or the circumvention of controls and risk management policies, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which may cause the Company’s

AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Although BlackRock has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks, it cannot assure that such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to its businesses. BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company’s controls, policies and procedures. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which could cause costly regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

BlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to additional costs or operational risk

.

BlackRock’s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to develop, market and manage new investment products and services. The development and introduction of new products and services require continued innovative efforts on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. A failure to continue to innovate to introduce new products and services or to successfully manage the risks associated with such products and services may cause BlackRock’s costs to fluctuate, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

The failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

BlackRock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company’s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain such employees include the Company’s reputation, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals. BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain talent may also be affected if European regulations instituting bonus caps or limiting the amount of compensation that asset managers can pay to certain employees are enacted in the varying formats in which they have been proposed.

In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to its employees is tied to the Company’s share price. As such, if BlackRock’s share price were to decrease materially, the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.

Future inorganic transactions may harm the Company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful.

BlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, and acquiring investment management businesses and other small and medium-sized companies. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities. Any failure to identify and mitigate these risks through due diligence and indemnification provisions could adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation, may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, and may harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry. Moreover, there can be no assurances that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from future inorganic transactions.

Investments in real assets such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm.

Investments in real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets. These may include:

•

construction risks, including labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment;

•

accidents, adverse weather, force majeure or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock’s control;

•

personal injury or property damage;

•

failures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws;

•

exposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection;

•

environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants;

•

changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities;


•

the financial resources of tenants; and

•

contingent liabilities on disposition of assets.

The above risks may expose BlackRock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation costs, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock’s clients.  These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to regulatory sanction or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. Similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which BlackRock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of BlackRock’s clients. The occurrence of any such events may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, divert management’s time and attention away from BlackRock’s business activities or cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, political, regulatory and other risks.

As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company’s control. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Risks Related to KEY THIRD-PARTY Relationships

The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, risk analytics, market data, market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. BlackRock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations; however, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, feasible alternative vendors available to BlackRock in certain areas. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could lead to operational and regulatory issues for the Company, including with respect to certain of its products, which could result in reputational harm and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Any disruption to the Company’s distribution channels may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. In particular, BlackRock entered into a global distribution agreement with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch in 2006, which is subject to renegotiation at the end of 2016. BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors is material to the Company’s future performance. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully, if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline.

Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s Exchange Traded Fund (“ETF”) platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility.

BlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF’s most recent net asset value (“NAV”). The NAV of an ETF is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the ETF’s holdings. The trading price of the ETF’s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. While an ETF’s creation/redemption feature and the arbitrage mechanism are designed to make it more likely that the ETF’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the ETF’s NAV, exchange prices may deviate significantly from the ETF’s NAV. ETF market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, inability or unwillingness of market markers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an ETF’s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively, or significant market volatility. Although BlackRock and other large issuers of ETFs are working with market participants to enhance U.S. equity market resiliency, there can be no assurance that structural reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion, or at all. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate significantly from an ETF’s NAV, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

BlackRock is subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world.

BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock’s business activities to a pervasive array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly, time-consuming and complex. BlackRock may be adversely affected by its failure to comply with current laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks, if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject, see “Item 1 – Business – Regulation.”


Regulatory reforms in the United States and internationally expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regul

atory scrutiny.

In recent years a number of proposals for regulatory reform have been introduced, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject is expected to increase. See “Item 1 – Business – Regulation.” A number of regulatory reforms that have been proposed may require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly and which may impede the Company’s growth and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s banking, insurance company and pension fund clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock. Key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include:

•

Designation as a systemically important financial institution

: Both the FSB, working with IOSCO, and FSOC are considering potential systemic risk related to asset management. In July 2014, the FSOC issued a statement indicating that their review would focus on products and activities, and FSOC subsequently released a request for information addressing: market liquidity and fund redemption risk, the use of leverage, operational risk, and the resolution of asset managers including the transition of client assets. In June 2015, IOSCO issued a statement indicating they also favored a products and activities approach in their review of asset managers, and in July 2015, the FSB made a similar announcement.  In September 2015, the FSB released a statement indicating that their review would focus on: market liquidity and fund redemption risk, the use of leverage, securities lending practices, operational risk, and risks from pension funds and sovereign wealth funds. Although FSOC, IOSCO and FSB have shifted from a focus on designating firms and/or funds as systemically important (i.e., G-SIFI or SIFI designations), the process is ongoing and may lead to designations in the future.  In the event that BlackRock receives a SIFI designation, under the DFA, the Federal Reserve System is charged with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions and BlackRock could become subject to its direct supervision.  If BlackRock were designated a SIFI or G-SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced prudential, capital, supervisory and other requirements, such as risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements, concentration limits, a contingent capital requirement, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits and overall risk management requirements. Requirements such as these, which were designed to regulate banking institutions, would be extremely burdensome for BlackRock, unless they were modified to be applicable to an asset manager. No proposals have been made indicating how such measures would be adapted for asset managers, if at all.

•

The Volcker Rule

: Provisions of the DFA referred to as the “Volcker Rule” created a new section of the BHC Act that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively “covered funds”). Conformance with the Volcker Rule’s requirements may reduce the level of market making and liquidity activities of several of BlackRock’s trading counterparties, which may adversely impact the liquidity and, in some cases, the pricing of various financial instruments in which BlackRock client accounts invest. Because the Federal Reserve currently treats BlackRock as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC, BlackRock may be required to conform its activities to the requirements of the Volcker Rule. On December 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve announced a second extension to the Volcker Rule conformance period, giving banking entities until July 21, 2016, to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (“legacy covered funds”). The Federal Reserve also announced its intention to grant banking entities an additional one-year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017, to conform ownership interests in and relationships with these legacy covered funds. BlackRock has chosen to commence a conformance program for covered funds, including legacy covered funds. The Volcker Rule’s restrictions may, among other things, limit BlackRock’s ability to invest in covered funds and require BlackRock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds. The Volcker Rule may also require BlackRock to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in covered funds, which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value, depending on market conditions.

•

Money market mutual fund reform

: Approximately 3% of BlackRock’s AUM as of December 31, 2015, consisted of assets in U.S. MMFs, of which institutional prime or institutional municipal MMFs (including offshore funds that feed into such MMFs) comprised approximately 2%. In July 2014, the SEC adopted new rules designed to reform the regulatory structure governing MMFs and to address the perceived systemic risks that such funds present. The new rules, to which U.S. MMFs must conform by October 2016, require institutional prime and institutional municipal MMFs to employ a floating net asset value per share method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Retail MMFs may continue operating with a constant net asset value per share.  The rules also provide for new tools for institutional and retail MMFs’ boards designed to address market shocks, including liquidity fees and redemption gates. The new rules do not apply to government (non-municipal) MMFs, although such funds may “opt-in” to the new liquidity fee and redemption gate provisions if previously disclosed to investors. Implementation of these new rules requires the development of new or additional systems by BlackRock and the funds’ service providers. BlackRock has commenced efforts to move its MMFs into compliance in advance of the deadline.  The impact of the rules that affect the structure of the funds on BlackRock’s business remains uncertain as clients must decide which products fit their investment needs.  The new rules will, however, affect certain of BlackRock’s funds’ investment strategies, portfolio liquidity and return potential. The new rules will also result in changes to BlackRock’s existing U.S. MMFs and may reduce the attractiveness of certain U.S. MMFs to investors.

•

Regulation of swaps and derivatives

: The implementation of DFA regulations, similar regulations in the EU and other global jurisdictions relating to swaps and derivatives could impact the manner in which BlackRock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, increasing the costs of derivatives trading for BlackRock’s clients. Various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules will also introduce new central clearing requirements for certain swap transactions and will require that certain swaps be executed only on or through electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), with which BlackRock will have to comply. In the United States, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are already subject to the DFA central clearing and electronic trading venue requirements, with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in 2016 and beyond.  For swaps and security-based swaps that are not centrally cleared, U.S. bank regulators recently adopted rules that could require BlackRock-advised funds and accounts to post margin payments when trading with a swap dealer that is regulated by one of the U.S. bank regulators. The CFTC also recently adopted similar margin rules applicable when trading non-cleared swaps with swap dealers who are not regulated by one of the U.S. bank regulators. These rules have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients. In EMEA, central clearing requirements will be implemented


in a phased manner and will apply to BlackRock funds and accounts beginning in the latter half of 2016. The new

rules and regulations may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock’s operational and legal risks.

•

SEC asset management industry initiatives:

The SEC and its staff continue to engage in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. During 2015, the SEC proposed, among other things: enhanced reporting by investment advisors, enhanced reporting on registered mutual funds, new rules for liquidity risk management in registered funds, and new rules governing the use of derivatives and leverage by registered investment companies and business development companies. Furthermore, in June 2015, the SEC issued a request for comments regarding practices related to ETFs, which is widely expected to result in a future rulemaking.  The SEC has also indicated an intention to propose new rules for the stress testing of registered investment companies and transition planning by asset managers, including the transfer of client assets.  The SEC’s focus has also been directed toward risk identification and controls in various areas, including the use of derivatives and other trading practices (as reflected in the SEC’s late December 2015 rule proposal referenced  in “Item 1 – Business – Regulation – Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives” above), cyber-security and the evaluation of systemic risks. While these proposals have yet to be finalized into new rules, any new rules, guidance or regulatory initiatives resulting from these efforts could require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities or fund management practices, or increase its public reporting and disclosure requirements, which could be time-consuming and costly and which may impede BlackRock's growth and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

•

Revised DoL Fiduciary Rule:

In April 2015, the DoL proposed a new regulation defining the term "fiduciary" for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the prohibited transaction exercise tax provisions of the IRS. The rule has been highly criticized by industry participants, particularly retail intermediaries, and BlackRock is engaging with the DoL, trade associations and industry participants in an effort to affect revisions to the proposed rule. To the extent the rule is enacted as written, it will require BlackRock to re-paper a number of its distribution relationships, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock’s distribution partners and may limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain useful services and education to its clients.

•

Increased international regulatory scrutiny

: In addition to the extensive scrutiny BlackRock faces from U.S.-based regulators, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the authority of numerous governmental and regulatory bodies globally, in particular in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. These regulators have imposed numerous regulations, guidelines and standards on the activities of BlackRock and its subsidiaries covering a variety of areas, including capital resources requirements, marketing activities, client and investor protections, senior management arrangements, and system and control requirements. In the event that BlackRock or any of its subsidiaries fails to comply with these often complex guidelines, regulations and standards, the regulators have broad powers to suspend or revoke any licenses they may have granted and/or to impose fines and/or sanctions.

•

European Union Directives

: In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European Commission (“EC”) initiated a plan for EU financial reform, including a number of consultations and initiatives intended to improve retail investor protections, which the EC reflected in new or updated Directives and regulations. The resulting review of MiFID, introduction of AIFMD, the introduction of MiFID II and the revision of the UCITS Directive have increased the compliance, disclosure and other obligations BlackRock faces in the European Economic Area. Once fully implemented, these Directives will have significant and wide-ranging impacts on EU securities and derivative markets, products and distribution, and internal governance arrangements, which will directly and indirectly impact BlackRock's EU regulated subsidiaries and other group companies.

•

Reform of European Retail Distribution

:

BlackRock must also comply with retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections, overhauling mutual fund fee structures by banning the payment of commissions to distributors and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector. The rules were originally introduced in the United Kingdom in 2012 and similar rules have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where BlackRock operates such as the Netherlands, and are under discussion elsewhere. Similarly, MiFID II will contain a ban on certain advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers. These rules will lead to greater fragmentation of distribution rules and may lead to changes to BlackRock’s client servicing and distribution models, in particular affecting the fees BlackRock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners.

Legal proceedings may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

BlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Certain of BlackRock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the SEC, Federal Reserve, OCC, DoL, CFTC and FCA. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations or proceedings. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings, have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant regulator to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock’s funds, other BlackRock clients or by BlackRock’s shareholders, which could harm the Company’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable for damages.

In addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts.

As BlackRock’s business continues to grow, the Company must routinely address conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. In addition, the SEC and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts. BlackRock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the Company fails, or appears to fail, to appropriately deal with any conflict of interest, it may face reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, or penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.


BlackRock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities.

As described in “Item 1-Business-Regulation”, PNC owns approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock. Based on the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve takes the position that this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, thereby subjecting BlackRock to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve. Such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that a nonbank subsidiary may conduct. The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over nonbank subsidiaries, including the power to prohibit them from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice, and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. PNC is regulated as a “financial holding company” under the BHC Act, which allows PNC and BlackRock to engage in a much broader set of activities than would otherwise be permitted under the BHC Act; any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth.

In addition, BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary, which is organized as a national bank, is separately subject to banking regulation by the OCC. The OCC has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary and also subjects it to capital requirements. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.

Failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

Of note among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past, and pose a risk that errors or omissions will occasionally occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.

New tax legislation or changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.

BlackRock’s businesses may be affected by new tax legislation or regulations, or the modification of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings, by U.S. or non-U.S. authorities. In particular, FATCA and the CRS have introduced new investor onboarding, withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring persons with financial assets outside of their tax residence country pay appropriate taxes. FATCA and CRS will impact both U.S. and non-U.S. funds and subject BlackRock to additional administrative burdens. Similarly, certain EU Member States have enacted FTTs, which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instrument and derivatives transactions. Several other EU Member States continue to discuss introducing FTTs. If introduced as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and on clients’ performance results. In addition, in October 2015 the OECD released its final BEPS package in an effort to curb the use of certain tax regimes and elements of tax planning, primarily in a cross-border context. The final package was endorsed by the G20 and is subject to implementation. BEPS contains a number of provisions that may negatively impact cross-border investing using commingled investment vehicles. In addition, in January 2016, the European Commission announced an Anti-Tax Avoidance Package (“EU Package”) for consideration by the European Parliament and Council containing measures to regulate certain elements of tax planning further and to boost tax transparency.  Once implemented, the BEPS package and the EU Package could curtail the amount of investments channeled by, and have unintended taxation consequences for, funds as well as the BlackRock’s overall tax position, which could adversely affect BlackRock’s financial condition and that of its clients.

The Company also manages significant assets in products and accounts that have specific tax objectives, which could be adversely impacted by changes in tax law or policy, particularly with respect to U.S. municipal income, the U.S. individual income tax rate on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains and, globally, alternative products. The application of complex tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities may review and challenge BlackRock’s historical tax positions. These challenges may result in adjustments to BlackRock’s tax position, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition.

Risks Related to BlackRock’s SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER

PNC owns a large portion of BlackRock’s capital stock. Future sales or distributions of BlackRock’s common stock in the public market by the Company or PNC could adversely affect the trading price of BlackRock’s common stock.

As of December 31, 2015, PNC owned 22% of the Company’s capital stock. Sales or distributions of a substantial number of shares of BlackRock’s common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales or distributions might occur, may cause the market price of BlackRock’s common stock to decline.

PNC has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of PNC.

As discussed in BlackRock’s proxy statement, PNC has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement with BlackRock. As a consequence, if the shares held by PNC constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determination of the BlackRock Board of Directors. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board.


As discussed in BlackRock’s proxy statement, pursuant to BlackRock’s stockholder agreement with PNC, the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors, or at leas

t two-thirds of the directors, then in office:

•

appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock;

•

any merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction in which beneficial ownership of a majority of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock would be held by persons different than those currently holding such majority of the total voting power, or any sale of all or substantially all assets of BlackRock;

•

any acquisition of any person or business which has a consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year that equals or exceeds 20% of BlackRock’s consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year if such acquisition involves the current or potential issuance of BlackRock capital stock constituting more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock issued and outstanding immediately after completion of such acquisition;

•

any acquisition of any person or business constituting a line of business that is materially different from the lines of business BlackRock and its controlled affiliates are engaged in at that time if such acquisition involves consideration in excess of 10% of the total assets of BlackRock on a consolidated basis;

•

except for repurchases otherwise permitted under the stockholder agreement, any repurchase by BlackRock or any subsidiary of shares of BlackRock capital stock such that after giving effect to such repurchase BlackRock and its subsidiaries shall have repurchased more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock within the 12-month period ending on the date of such repurchase;

•

any amendment to BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or

•

any matter requiring stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the NYSE.

Additionally, BlackRock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of PNC:

•

any sale of any subsidiary of BlackRock, the annualized revenue of which, together with the annualized revenue of any other subsidiaries disposed of within the same year, are more than 20% of the annualized revenue of BlackRock for the preceding fiscal year on a consolidated basis;

•

for so long as BlackRock is a subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, entering into any business or activity that is prohibited for any such subsidiary under the BHC Act;

•

any amendment of any provision of a stockholder agreement between BlackRock and any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to PNC or materially more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock than to PNC;

•

any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of PNC or more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause PNC or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences; or

•

a voluntary bankruptcy or similar filing by BlackRock.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

The Company has no unresolved comments from the SEC staff relating to BlackRock’s periodic or current reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act

.

Item 2. Properties

BlackRock’s principal office, which is leased, is located at 55 East 52nd Street, New York, New York. BlackRock leases additional office space in New York City at 40 East 52nd Street and throughout the world, including Boston, Chicago, Edinburgh, Gurgaon (India), Hong Kong, London, Melbourne, Munich, Princeton (New Jersey), San Francisco, Seattle, Singapore, Sydney, Taipei and Tokyo. The Company also owns an 84,500 square foot office building in Wilmington (Delaware).

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. federal, state governmental and domestic and international regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. It is BlackRock’s policy to cooperate fully with such inquiries. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Additionally, BlackRock advised investment portfolios may be subject to lawsuits, any of which potentially could harm the investment returns of the applicable portfolio or result in the Company being liable to the portfolios for any resulting damages.

On May 27, 2014, certain purported investors in the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund, Inc. and the BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund (collectively, the “Funds”) filed a consolidated complaint (the “Consolidated Complaint”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against BlackRock Advisors, LLC, BlackRock Investment Management, LLC and BlackRock International Limited (collectively, the “Defendants”) under the caption

In re BlackRock Mutual Funds Advisory Fee Litigation

. The Consolidated Complaint, which purports to be brought derivatively on behalf of the Funds, alleges that the Defendants violated Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act by receiving allegedly excessive investment advisory fees from the Funds. On February 24, 2015, the same plaintiffs filed another complaint in the same


court against BlackRock Investment Management, LLC and BlackRock Advisors, LLC. The allegations and legal claims in both complaints are substantially similar, with the new complaint p

urporting to challenge fees received by Defendants after the plaintiffs filed their prior complaint. Both complaints seek, among other things, to recover on behalf of the Funds all allegedly excessive advisory fees received by Defendants in the twelve mont

h period preceding the start of each lawsuit, along with purported lost investment returns on those amounts, plus interest. On March 25, 2015, Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint was denied. The Defendants believe the claims in both la

wsuits are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions.

Between November 12, 2015 and November 16, 2015, BlackRock, Inc., BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (“BRA”) and the BlackRock Granite Property Fund, Inc. (“Granite Fund”), along with certain other Granite Fund-related entities (collectively, the “BlackRock Parties”) were named as defendants in thirteen separate lawsuits filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Alameda arising out of the June 16, 2015 collapse of a balcony at the Library Gardens apartment complex in Berkeley, California (the “Property”). The Property is indirectly owned by the Granite Fund, which is managed by BRA. The plaintiffs also named as defendants in the lawsuits Greystar, which is the property manager of the Property, and certain other entities, including the developer of the Property, building contractors and building materials suppliers. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the BlackRock Parties were negligent in their ownership, control and maintenance of the Property’s balcony, and seek monetary, including punitive, damages. BlackRock believes the claims in the lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions.

Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material effect on BlackRock’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, there is no assurance as to whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material effect on BlackRock’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows in any future reporting period. Due to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of these matters, management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters.

Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity, excluding an appropriated retained deficit of $19 million for 2014 and appropriated retained earnings of $22 million for 2013, divided by total common and preferred shares outstanding at December 31 of the respective year-end.

2015 Compared with 2014

GAAP.

Operating income of $4,664 million increased $190 million and operating margin of 40.9% increased 50 bps from 2014. Operating income reflected growth in base fees and performance fees, partially offset by higher expense. The Company’s 2015 expense reflected higher revenue-related expense, including compensation, and distribution and servicing costs, partially offset by lower general and administration expense and lower amortization of intangible assets.  In connection with the Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”) acquisition, BlackRock recorded a $50 million indemnification asset for unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the resolution of outstanding tax matters in 2014, BlackRock recorded $50 million of general and administration expense in 2014 to reflect the reduction of the indemnification asset and an offsetting $50 million tax benefit.  Results for 2014 also included $11 million of closed-end fund launch costs. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, decreased $20 million from 2014 due to lower net gains on investments in 2015.

Income tax expense for 2015 included a $54 million net noncash benefit associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and state and local income tax changes and benefited from $75 million of nonrecurring items.  Income tax expense for 2014 included $94 million of tax benefits, including the $50 million tax benefit mentioned above, a $9 million net noncash benefit, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of domestic state and local tax changes, and a $73 million net tax benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items.

Diluted earnings per common share rose $0.54, or 3%, compared with the prior year period, reflecting higher operating income and the benefit of share repurchases, partially offset by the impact of a higher 2015 effective tax rate and lower nonoperating income.

As Adjusted

.

Operating income of $4,695 million increased $132 million from 2014 and the operating margin for both 2015 and 2014 was 42.9%. Income tax expense on an as adjusted basis for 2015

included a $75 million net benefit and

excluded the net noncash benefit of $54 million described above. General and administration expense for 2014 excluded the $50 million related to the reduction of the indemnification asset described above.  Income tax expense for 2014

included a $73 million net benefit and excluded a $50 million tax benefit associated with the reduction of the same indemnification asset and $9 million of net noncash benefits described above.

Diluted earnings per common share

rose $0.26, or 1%, from 2014.

2014 Compared with 2013

GAAP.

Operating income of $4,474 million increased $617 million from 2013, reflecting growth in base fees and

BlackRock Solutions

and advisory revenue, partially offset by higher expense. The Company’s 2014 expense reflected higher revenue-related expense, including compensation and direct fund expense. Expense for 2014 also included the previously mentioned $50 million general and administration expense related to the reduction of an indemnification asset and $11 million of closed-end fund launch costs. The 2013 expense included $124 million of expense related to the Charitable Contribution described below and $18 million of closed-end fund launch costs.


Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, decreased $146 million from 2013. Expense for 2013 incl

uded a $39 million noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain related to the carrying value of the Company’s equity method investment as a result of an initial public offering of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (the “PennyMac IPO”). In addition, in 2013, the Com

pany made a charitable contribution of approximately six million units of the Company’s investment in PennyMac to a donor advised fund (the “Charitable Contribution”). In connection with the Charitable Contribution, the Company also recorded a noncash, non

operating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed investment. The decrease in nonoperating income (expense) also reflected net lower returns on the co-investment and seed portfolio and higher interest expense resulting from a long-term debt

issuance in March 2014, partially offset by the positive impact of the monetization of a nonstrategic, opportunistic private equity investment during 2014.

Income tax expense of $1,131 million included $94 million of tax benefits, including the $50 million tax benefit mentioned above. Income tax expense for 2014 and 2013 reflected the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. Income tax expense for 2014 included a $9 million net noncash benefit arising primarily from state and local income tax changes and a $73 million net benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items. Income tax expense for 2013 included a $69 million noncash benefit, primarily related to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and state and local income tax changes. In addition, 2013 income tax expense included a benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution, a benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items.

Diluted earnings per common share rose $2.38, or 14%, from 2013 due to higher net income and the benefit of share repurchases.

As Adjusted

. Operating income of $4,563 million and operating margin of 42.9% increased $539 million and 150 basis points, respectively, from 2013. Results for 2014 excluded a $50 million general and administrative expense related to the reduction of an indemnification asset. The 2014 income tax expense included a $73 million net benefit and excluded a $50 million tax benefit associated with the reduction of the same indemnification asset and $9 million of net noncash benefits described above. The 2013 results excluded the financial impact of the Charitable Contribution, but included the $39 million pre-tax nonoperating gain related to the PennyMac IPO. The 2013 income tax expense included a benefit of approximately $29 million and benefits from certain nonrecurring items and excluded the $69 million net noncash benefit, described above. Diluted earnings per common share rose $2.76, or 17%, from 2013.

BlackRock Solutions’

analytical and risk management expertise.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.


Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows:

(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors.

•

Operating income, as adjusted,

includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense).  In 2014, general and administration expense relating to the reduction of an indemnification asset has been excluded since it is directly offset by a tax benefit of the same amount and, consequently, does not impact BlackRock’s book value.  In 2013, the $124 million expense related to the Charitable Contribution was excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature and because the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million directly related to the contributed PennyMac investment is reported in nonoperating income (expense).

•

Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.

Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue the Company earns. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue.

(2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted:

Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, equals nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, adjusted for compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis.

During 2013, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed PennyMac investment was excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature and because the more than offsetting associated Charitable Contribution expense of $124 million is reported in operating income.


(3) N

et income attributable to BlackRock, as adjusted:

See the aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation and the Charitable Contribution.

For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for 2013 included a tax benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The tax benefit has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted due to the nonrecurring nature of the Charitable Contribution.

Non-GAAP income tax matters adjustments for 2015, 2014 and 2013 reflected the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities. The amount for 2015 included a $54 million net noncash benefit, primarily related to the impact of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and state and local income tax changes. The amount for 2014 included a $9 million net noncash tax benefit arising primarily from state and local income tax changes. The amount for 2013 included a $69 million noncash tax benefit, primarily related to the impact of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and state and local income tax changes. Such amounts for 2015, 2014 and 2013 have been excluded from as adjusted results as they will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.

(4) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

Net market depreciation of $57.5 billion was driven by $35.3 billion from equity products due to lower U.S. and global equity markets and $12.1 billion from fixed income products.

AUM decreased $101.1 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar.

AUM increased $327.8 billion, or 8%, to $4.652 trillion at December 31, 2014 from $4.324 trillion at December 31, 2013. The increase in AUM was driven by net market appreciation of $261.7 billion and net inflows of $193.8 billion, partially offset by foreign exchange movements.

Net market appreciation of $261.7 billion included $140.8 billion of growth in equity products primarily due to higher U.S. equity markets, and appreciation of $98.8 billion and $21.0 billion in fixed income and multi-asset products, respectively, across the majority of strategies.

AUM decreased $127.7 billion from foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen.

Discussion of Financial Results

Introduction

BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.

BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand.

Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRock’s revenue and earnings. The magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products; however, the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31.

BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name

BlackRock Solutions

and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. The Company’s

Aladdin

operating platform serves as the investment/risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for

BlackRock Solutions

and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the

Aladdin

platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met.

BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its

Aladdin

platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures.

The Company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions from acting as a broker-dealer in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur.

The Company also earns revenue related to certain strategic investments accounted for as equity method investments.


Operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.

•

Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs.

•

Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments made to Merrill Lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement, to PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products.

•

Direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expense incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business.

General and administration expense includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed-end fund launch costs and other general and administration expense, including the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. Foreign currency remeasurement (gains) losses were $(8) million, $(11) million and $1 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Approximately 75% of the Company’s revenue is generated in U.S. dollars. The Company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the euro and British pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. Any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the Company’s considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the United States.

Nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.

In addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income.

Direct fund expense

increased $91 million, reflecting higher average AUM, primarily related to

iShares

, where BlackRock pays certain nonadvisory expense of the funds.

General and administration expense

decreased $87 million, primarily due to the $124 million related to the Charitable Contribution incurred in 2013 and foreign currency remeasurement, partially offset by the $50 million reduction of an indemnification asset.

As Adjusted

. Expense, as adjusted, increased $362 million, or 6%, to $6,518 million in 2014 from $6,156 million in 2013.

The amount for 2015 primarily includes a gain related to the acquisition of certain assets of BKCA.

2015 Compared with 2014

BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors LLC

.    On March 6, 2015, BlackRock acquired certain assets related to managing BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (formerly known as BlackRock Kelso Capital Corporation) from BKCA. In connection with the acquisition, BlackRock recorded a noncash, nonoperating, pre-tax gain of $40 million related to the fair value of its pre-existing interest in BKCA. See Note 9,

Goodwill,

and Note 10,

Intangible Assets

, for further discussion on the BKCA acquisition.

Net gains on investments of $109 million in 2015 decreased $45 million from 2014 due to lower net positive marks in 2015. Net gains on investments in 2015 included a $40 million gain related to the BKCA acquisition and a $35 million unrealized gain on a private equity investment. Net gains on investments in 2014 included the positive impact of the monetization of a nonstrategic, opportunistic private equity investment.

Interest expense decreased $28 million from 2014 primarily due to repayments of long-term borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2014.

2014 Compared with 2013

Net gains on investments of $154 million in 2014 decreased $132 million from 2013.

Income Tax Expense

(1)

Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI.

The Company’s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions, which have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, include the United Kingdom, Channel Islands, Canada and the Netherlands. U.S. income taxes were not provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States.


2015.

Income tax expense

(GAAP)

reflected:

o

a net noncash benefit of $54 million, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities; and

o

a benefit from $75 million of nonrecurring items.

The as adjusted effective tax rate of 28.4% for 2015 excluded the net noncash benefit of $54 million mentioned above, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.

2014.

Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected:

o

a $94 million tax benefit, primarily due to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters related to the acquisition of BGI, including the previously mentioned $50 million tax benefit (see

Executive Summary

for more information);

o

a $73 million net tax benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items; and

o

a net noncash benefit of $9 million associated with the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities.

The as adjusted effective tax rate of 26.6% for 2014 excluded the $9 million net noncash benefit as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented and $50 million tax benefit mentioned above. The $50 million general and administrative expense and $50 million tax benefit have been excluded from as adjusted results as there is no impact on BlackRock’s book value.

2013.

Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected:

o

a $69 million net noncash benefit primarily related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill, including the effect of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and domestic state and local income tax changes;

o

a tax benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution; and

o

a tax benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items.

The as adjusted effective tax rate of 28.5% for 2013 excluded the $69 million net noncash benefit and the $48 million tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution mentioned above.

Balance Sheet Overview

As Adjusted Balance Sheet

The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment funds, including consolidated VIEs.

The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements

Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.

In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.

Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds

The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds accounted for as voting rights entities (“VREs”) and VIEs, (collectively, “Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds”). See Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for further information of the Company’s consolidation policy.


The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by

Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds

to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by

Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds

in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

(1)

Amounts represent segregated client assets generating advisory fees in which BlackRock has no economic interest or liability.

(2)

Amounts represent the portion of assets and liabilities of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds attributable to NCI.

(3)

Amounts include property and equipment and other assets.

(4)

Amount includes approximately $5.6 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles.  See Note 20,

Income Taxes

, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for more information.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.

Assets.

Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 and 2014 included $100 million and $120 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (see

Liquidity and Capital Resources

for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2015).

Accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 increased $117 million from December 31, 2014 due to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and higher performance fee receivables. Investments were $1,578 million at December 31, 2015 (for more information see

Investments

herein). Goodwill and intangible assets increased $190 million from December 31, 2014, primarily due to the BKCA, Infraestructura Institucional and FutureAdvisor acquisitions,

partially offset by $128 million of amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including property, plant and equipment) increased $284 million from December 31, 2014, primarily related to an increase in property and equipment, higher earnings from certain strategic investments, and an increase in current taxes receivable.

Liabilities.

Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2015 increased $106 million from December 31, 2014, primarily due to 2015 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2015 increased $33 million from December 31, 2014 due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within accounts receivable) and increased accruals, partially offset by a decrease in current income taxes payable.

Net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2015 decreased $138 million, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock compensation, the BKCA acquisition, realization of loss carryforwards, and goodwill and intangibles. Other liabilities increased $147 million from December 31, 2014, primarily resulting from an increase in uncertain tax positions and consolidated funds liabilities.


Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs

The Company’s investments and investments of consolidated VIEs (collectively, “Total Investments”) were $1,578 million and $1,030 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015. Total Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s Total Investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of Total Investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The Company presents Total Investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of its Total Investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.

The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors.  The economic impact of Total Investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

(1)

Amounts represent investments held in sponsored investment funds that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP as either a VIE or VRE. See Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, for further information on the Company’s consolidation policy and the 2015 adoption of ASU 2015-02.

(2)

Amount includes $81 million of carried interest (VIEs), which has no impact on the Company’s “economic” investment exposure.

The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at December 31, 2015 and 2014:

(1)

Other alternatives include distressed credit/mortgage funds/opportunistic funds and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds.

(2)

Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income, equity and multi-asset mutual funds/strategies as well as U.K. government securities, primarily held for regulatory purposes.

As adjusted investment activity for 2015 was as follows:

(1)

Amounts include distributions representing return of capital and return on investments.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds

The consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the Consolidated


Sponsored Investment Funds

, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of

BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented

in accordance with GAAP.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds:

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenue from

BlackRock Solutions

and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.

Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.

Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, for 2015 were $309 million and primarily reflected $412 million of investment purchases, $221 million of purchases of property and equipment and $273 million related to certain acquisitions, partially offset by $531 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments.

Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, for 2015 were $2,548 million, primarily resulting from $1.3 billion of share repurchases, including $1.1 billion in open-market transactions and $231 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions and $1.5 billion of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $126 million of proceeds from stock options and $105 million of excess tax benefits from vested stock-based compensation awards.

The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:

(1)

The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries was approximately 50% at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.  See

Net Capital Requirements

herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries.

(2)

The Company cannot readily access such cash to use in its operating activities.

(


)

Amounts do not reflect year-end incentive compensation accruals of approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion for 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were paid in February of the following year.

Total liquidity resources increased $390 million during 2015, primarily reflecting cash from operations, partially offset by cash payments of 2014 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $1.3 billion and cash dividend payments.

A significant portion of the Company’s $2,227 million of Total Investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.

Share Repurchases.

The Company repurchased 3.1 million common shares in open market-transactions under the share repurchase program for approximately $1.1 billion during 2015. At December 31, 2015, there were 6.3 million shares still authorized to be repurchased.


Net Capital Requirements.

The Company

is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries o

f the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax c

onsequences that could discourage such transfers.

BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.1 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers.  The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.

Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $4.7 billion of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The Company’s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds.

Short-Term Borrowings

2015 Revolving Credit Facility.

In April 2015, the Company’s credit facility was further amended to extend the maturity date to March 2020 and to increase the amount of the aggregate commitment to $4.0 billion (the “2015 credit facility”). The 2015 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2015 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2015 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2015. The 2015 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2015, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2015 credit facility.

Commercial Paper Program.

The maximum aggregate amount for which the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion as amended in April 2015. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2015 credit facility. At December 31, 2015, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.

Long-Term Borrowings.

The carrying value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2015 included the following:

During 2015, the Company fully repaid $750 million of 1.375% notes at maturity. In May 2015, the Company issued

€

700 million of 1.25% senior unsecured notes maturing in May 2025. Upon conversion to U.S. dollars the Company designated the €700 million debt offering as a net investment hedge to offset its currency exposure relating to its net investment in certain euro functional currency operations. For more information on Company’s borrowings, see Note 12,

Borrowings

, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies

The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2015:


(1)

The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the expected payment amounts using foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2015 under the terms of the business acquisition’s agreement. The fair value of the contingent obligations is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition and is recorded within other liabilities.

(2)

At December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $350 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above.

Operating Leases.

The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Purchase Obligations.

In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio services, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. Purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2015.

Investment Commitments.

At December 31, 2015, the Company had $179 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including consolidated VIEs.  These funds include private equity funds, real estate funds, infrastructure funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. In addition to the capital commitments of $179 million, the Company had approximately $38 million of contingent commitments for certain funds which have investment periods that have expired. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.

Contingent Distribution Obligations.

In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of AUM maintained in certain BlackRock products. The initial term of the agreement remained in effect until January 2014 and was renewed for one automatic three-year extension.

Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions

. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to the acquired businesses achieving specified performance targets over a certain period, subsequent to the applicable acquisition date.

The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at December 31, 2015 is included in other liabilities and is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition.

The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table:

Carried Interest Clawback.

As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in Total Investments, or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable.

Indemnifications.

In the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2015. See further discussion in Note 13,

Commitments and Contingencies

, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.

On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. At December 31, 2015, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $169.3 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $179.6 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2015. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at December 31, 2015.

While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.


Compensation and Benefit Obligations.

The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined co

ntribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations

and commitments table above. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2015 totaled $

1,971

million and inc

luded incentive compensation of $

1,452

million, deferred compensation of $


million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $


million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first

quarter of 2016,

while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods

of

up to five years.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.

Consolidation

In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. See Note 4,

Consolidated Voting Right Entities

, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for more information. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity.

At December 31, 2015, BlackRock was determined to be the PB for certain investment products that were determined to be VIEs, which required BlackRock to consolidate them. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. See Note 5,

Variable Interest Entities

, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for more information.

See Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies — Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2015

, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for more information on ASU 2015-02.

Investments

Equity Method Investments

. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity.

BlackRock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for certain strategic investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRock’s core business.

At December 31, 2015, the Company had $527 million and $265 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2014, the Company had $654 million and $208 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively.

Impairments of Investments.

Management periodically assesses equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for other-than-temporary Impairment (“OTTI”). If an OTTI exists, an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of the income.

For equity method, held-to-maturity and cost method investments, if circumstances indicate that an OTTI may exist, the investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the Company determines an OTTI exists, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value.

For available-for-sale securities, when the fair value is lower than cost, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. For equity securities, if the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value. For debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery; or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the


security, the entire difference between the amortized cost and fair value must be recognized in earnings.

If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required t

o sell the security but the security has suffered a

n impairment related to

credit, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total

decline in value

and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.

For the Company’s investments in CLOs, the Company reviews cash flow estimates over the life of each CLO investment.  On a quarterly basis, if the present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows, an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value.

Evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K for more information on fair value measurements.

Changes in Valuation.

Changes in value on $2,261 million of Total Investments will impact the Company’s nonoperating income (expense), $44 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $203 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $100 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2015, changes in fair value of approximately $1,649 million of such consolidated VIEs/VREs will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $1,268 million.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350,

Intangibles – Goodwill and Other

(“ASC 350”), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2015, ranged from 1 to 9 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 3.7 years.

Goodwill.

The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2015 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s common stock closed at $340.52, which exceeded its book value of approximately $172.12 per share.

Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles.

The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate.

In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, BlackRock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.

For finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the carrying value of the

asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.

In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $128 million, $157 million and $161 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. The Company determined that no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus


finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were requi

red. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment.

Income Taxes

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2015, BlackRock had $466 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $320 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2015, the Company had deferred tax assets of $20 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $4,851 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company.

The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. The assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.

The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $166 million and current income taxes payables of $79 million at December 31, 2015.

Revenue Recognition

Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers.

The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third-party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605-45,

Revenue Recognition — Principal Agent Considerations

(“ASC 605-45”), and records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $870 million, $891 million and $785 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income.

The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. Revenue is accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, securities lending revenue earned by the Company totaled $513 million, $477 million and $447 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee.

The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations, from certain actively managed investment funds and certain SMAs. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer.

In addition, the Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations depending upon future performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in Total Investments or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable.

The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $143 million and $105 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest liability will be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown.


The following table presents changes in the deferred carried interest liability (in

cluding the portion related to consolidated VIEs) for 2015 and 2014:

For 2015, 2014 and 2013, performance fee revenue totaled $621 million, $550 million and $561 million, respectively.

Fees earned for

BlackRock Solutions

, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed or when completed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the

Aladdin

platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For 2015, 2014 and 2013,

BlackRock Solutions

and advisory revenue totaled $646 million, $635 million and $577 million, respectively.

Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenue until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable.

Recent Developments

In November 2015, the Company announced that it had entered an agreement to assume investment management responsibilities of approximately $87 billion of cash assets under management from BofA® Global Capital Management, Bank of America’s asset management business. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.  This transaction is not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Accounting Developments

Significant Accounting Policies

, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.

Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

AUM Market Price Risk.

BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2015, the majority of the Company’s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees.

Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks.

As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval.

In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments.

BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into swaps to hedge market and interest rate exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding total return swaps and interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $360 million and $46 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2015, approximately $1.7 billion of BlackRock’s Total Investments were maintained in consolidated sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is $1,548 million. See

Balance Sheet Overview

-

Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs

in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information on the Company’s Total Investments.

Equity Market Price Risk.

At December 31, 2015, the Company’s net exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $578 million of the Company’s total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments, hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $57.8 million in the carrying value of such investments.

Interest-Rate/Credit Spread Risk.

At December 31, 2015, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $970 million of Total Investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a


fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $

14.6

million in the carrying value of such investments.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk.

As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling and euro, was $343 million at December 31, 2015. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $34.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

Other Market Risks.

The Company executes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of certain foreign exchange risk movements. At December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $169 million.

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

February 26, 2016


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BlackRock, Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2015 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST

ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BlackRock, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation

Business

. BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm providing a broad range of investment and risk management services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.

BlackRock’s diverse platform of active (alpha) and index (beta) investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset class portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds,

iShares

®

exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), separate accounts, collective investment funds and other pooled investment vehicles. BlackRock also offers the

BlackRock Solutions

®

investment and risk management technology platform,

Aladdin

®

, risk analytics and advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional investors.

At December 31, 2015, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) held 21.1% of the Company’s voting common stock and 22.2% of the Company’s capital stock, which includes outstanding common and nonvoting preferred stock.

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition represents the portion of consolidated sponsored investment funds in which the Company does not have direct equity ownership. Accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Certain items previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2015

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.

In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2015-02,

Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

, (“ASU 2015-02”) that requires companies to reevaluate all legal entities under revised consolidation guidance. The revised consolidation rules provide guidance for evaluating: i) limited partnerships and similar entities for consolidation ii) how decision maker or service provider fees affect the consolidation analysis, iii) how interests held by related parties affect the consolidation analysis, and iv) the consolidation analysis required for certain investment funds. The consolidation guidance also provides a scope exception for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.

The Company early adopted ASU 2015-02 using the modified retrospective method with an effective adoption date of January 1, 2015. The modified retrospective method did not require the restatement of prior year periods. In connection with the adoption of ASU 2015-02, the Company reevaluated all of its investment products for consolidation. As of January 1, 2015, the Company deconsolidated all of its previously consolidated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) as its fee arrangements were no longer deemed to be variable interests and it held no other interests in these entities.

The adoption of the ASU also resulted in the consolidation of certain investment products that were not previously consolidated. Upon adoption, these products became consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) as the Company is considered the party with both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

The impact to the consolidated statement of financial condition upon adoption was primarily the deconsolidation of approximately $3.6 billion of assets and $3.6 billion of liabilities related to certain CLOs that the Company manages with an adjustment to appropriated retained earnings of $19 million. In addition, certain investment products previously accounted for as voting rights entities (“VREs”) became VIEs under the new accounting guidance and were consolidated.

Debt Issuance Costs.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,

Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

(“ASU 2015-03”). ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-03 during 2015 on a retrospective basis, which required the restatement of prior periods. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 was not material to the consolidated financial statements.

Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate NAV per Share.

In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,

Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)

(“ASU 2015-07”). ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value (“NAV”) per share practical expedient. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-07 during 2015 on a retrospective basis, which required the restatement of prior periods. As a result of the adoption, $647 million and $692 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of NAV investments are no longer included in Level 2 and 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

. Cash and cash equivalents primarily consists of cash, money market funds and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less in which the Company is exposed to market and credit risk. Cash and cash

F-9

equivalent balances that are legally restricted from use by the Company are recorded in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Cash balances maintained by consolidated VREs are not considered

legally restricted and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Cash balances maintained by consolidated VIEs are included in assets of consolidated variable interest entities on the consolidated stat

ements of financial condition.

Investments.

Investments in Debt and Marketable Equity Securities.

BlackRock classifies debt and marketable equity investments as trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity based on the Company’s intent to sell the security or, for a debt security, the Company’s intent and ability to hold the debt security to maturity.

Trading securities are those investments that are purchased principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change.

Held-to-maturity debt securities are purchased with the positive intent and ability to be held to maturity and are recorded at amortized cost on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Available-for-sale securities are those securities that are not classified as trading or held-to-maturity. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders’ equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available-for-sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income.

Equity Method

. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. BlackRock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is recorded as net gain (loss) on investments within nonoperating income (expense) and as other revenue for certain strategic investments since such companies are considered to be an extension of BlackRock’s core business. BlackRock’s share of net income of the investee is recorded based upon the most current information available at the time, which may precede the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition. Distributions received from the investment reduce the Company’s carrying value of the investee and the cost basis if deemed to be a return of capital.

Cost Method

. For nonmarketable equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Dividends received from the investment are recorded as dividend income within nonoperating income (expense).

Impairments of Investments

. Management periodically assesses equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”). If an OTTI exists, an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of the income.

For equity method, held-to-maturity and cost method investments, if circumstances indicate that an OTTI may exist, the investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the Company determines an OTTI exists, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value.

For available-for-sale securities, when the fair value is lower than cost, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security’s issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. For equity securities, if the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value. For debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery; or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, the entire difference between the amortized cost and fair value must be recognized in earnings.  If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered an impairment related to credit, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total decline in value and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.

For the Company’s investments in CLOs, the Company reviews cash flow estimates over the life of each CLO investment.  On a quarterly basis, if the present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows, an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value.

Consolidation.

The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. VREs are typically consolidated if the Company holds the majority voting interest. Upon the occurrence of certain events (such as contributions and redemptions, either by the Company, or third parties, or amendments to the governing documents of the Company’s investment products), management reviews and reconsiders its previous conclusion regarding the status of an entity as a VIE or a VRE. Additionally, management continually reconsiders whether the Company is deemed to be a VIE’s PB that consolidates such entity.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

.    Certain investment products for which a controlling financial interest is achieved through arrangements that do not involve or are not directly linked to voting interests are deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including whether or not i) the entity has equity that is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties and ii) the equity holders at risk have the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns, and the right to direct the activities of

F-10

the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock re-evaluates such factors as facts and circumstances change.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, the Company used two methods for determining whether it was the PB of a VIE depending on the nature and characteristics of the entity. For CLOs, the Company was deemed to be the PB if it had the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impacted the entity’s economic performance and had the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. For certain sponsored investment funds, the Company was deemed to be the PB if it absorbed the majority of the entity’s expected losses, received a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both.

Following the adoption of ASU 2015-02, all VIEs are evaluated for consolidation under a single method. The PB of a VIE is defined as the variable interest holder that has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. A controlling financial interest is defined as (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The consolidation analysis can generally be performed qualitatively, however, if it is not readily apparent that the Company is not the PB, a quantitative analysis may also be performed.

Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities

.    BlackRock is required to consolidate an investee to the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a greater than 50% voting equity interest.

Retention of Specialized Investment Company Accounting Principles.

Upon consolidation of sponsored investment funds, the Company retains the specialized investment company accounting principles of the underlying funds. All of the underlying investments held by such consolidated sponsored investment funds are carried at fair value with corresponding changes in the investments’ fair values reflected in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. When the Company no longer controls these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for as an equity method investment, available-for-sale security or trading investment if the Company still maintains an investment.

Money Market Fee Waivers

.    The Company is currently voluntarily waiving a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintain a minimum level of daily net investment income (the “Yield Support waivers”). During 2015, these waivers resulted in a reduction of management fees of approximately $137 million. Approximately 50% of Yield Support waivers were offset by a reduction of BlackRock’s distribution and servicing costs paid to a financial intermediary. BlackRock has provided Yield Support waivers in prior periods and may increase or decrease the level of fee waivers in future periods.

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities

.

Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The life insurance company does not underwrite any insurance contracts that involve any insurance risk transfer from the insured to the life insurance company. The separate account assets primarily include equity securities, debt securities, money market funds and derivatives. The separate account assets are not subject to general claims of the creditors of BlackRock. These separate account assets and the related equal and offsetting liabilities are recorded as separate account assets and separate account liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

The net investment income attributable to separate account assets supporting individual and group pension contracts accrues directly to the contract owner and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these separate account assets and liabilities, BlackRock earns policy administration and management fees associated with these products, which are included in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.

Separate Account Collateral Assets Held and Liabilities Under Securities Lending Agreements.

The Company facilitates securities lending arrangements whereby securities held by separate accounts maintained by BlackRock Life Limited are lent to third parties under global master securities lending agreements. In exchange, the Company receives legal title to the collateral with minimum values generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the securities lent in order to reduce counterparty risk. The required collateral value is calculated on a daily basis. The global master securities lending agreements provide the Company the right to request additional collateral or, in the event of borrower default, the right to liquidate collateral. The securities lending transactions entered into by the Company are accompanied by an agreement that entitles the Company to request the borrower to return the securities at any time; therefore, these transactions are not reported as sales

The Company records on the consolidated statements of financial condition the cash and noncash collateral received under these BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. During 2015 and 2014, the Company had not resold or repledged any of the collateral received under these arrangements. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of loaned securities held by separate accounts was approximately $28.8 billion and $30.6 billion, respectively, and the fair value of the collateral held under these securities lending agreements was approximately $31.3 billion and $33.7 billion, respectively.

Property and Equipment

. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally determined by cost less any estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term.

BlackRock develops a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services for internal use, utilizing proprietary software that is hosted and maintained by BlackRock. The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included within property and equipment on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are amortized, beginning when the software project is ready for its intended use, over the estimated useful life of the software of approximately three years.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company has determined that it has one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes, the consolidated BlackRock single

F-11

operating segment, which is consistent with internal management reporting and management's oversight of operations.

In

its assessment of goodwill for impairment, the Company considers such factors as the book value and market capitalization of the Company.

On a quarterly basis, the Company considers if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a potential goodwill impairment. If a triggering event has occurred, the Company performs assessments, which may include reviews of significant valuation assumptions, to determine if goodwill may be impaired. The Company performs an impairment assessment of its goodwill at least annually as of July 31

st

.

Intangible assets are comprised of indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition. The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open-end funds and collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date is generally classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such contracts primarily is based upon the following: (i) the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these products; (ii) the Company expects to, and has the ability to, continue to operate these products indefinitely; (iii) the products have multiple investors and are not reliant on a single investor or small group of investors for their continued operation; (iv) current competitive factors and economic conditions do not indicate a finite life; and (v) there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets when they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining useful lives.

The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired and whether the indefinite-lived and finite-lived classifications are still appropriate. The carrying value of finite-lived management contracts and their remaining useful lives are reviewed at least annually to determine if circumstances exist which may indicate a potential impairment or revisions to the amortization period. The Company performs impairment assessments of all of its intangible assets at least annually, as of July 31

st

.

In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock assesses various significant qualitative factors, including assets under management (“AUM”), revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considers other factors, including (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.

For finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform a recoverability test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.

Noncontrolling Interests.

The Company reports noncontrolling interests as equity, separate from the parent’s equity, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, the Company’s consolidated net income on the consolidated statements of income includes the income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest holders of the Company’s consolidated investment products. Income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is not adjusted for income taxes for consolidated investment products that are treated as pass-through entities for tax purposes.

Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities.

The Company includes redeemable noncontrolling interests related to certain consolidated investment products in temporary equity on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Treasury Stock

. The Company records common stock purchased for treasury at cost. At the date of subsequent reissuance, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock using the average cost method.

Revenue Recognition

Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue

. Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of AUM or committed capital. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers.

The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various mutual fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the Company manages. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund (primarily international funds) takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the Company bears no credit risk to the third-party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605-45,

Revenue Recognition – Principal Agent Considerations,

and records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $870 million, $891 million and $785 million, respectively, and were reflected net in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.

The Company also earns revenue by lending securities as an agent on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Revenue is accounted for on an accrual basis. The revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed.

F-12

Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest

. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations from certain actively managed investment fund

s and certain separately managed accounts (“SMAs”). These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product o

r account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer.

In addition, the Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations depending upon future performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in total investments or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable.

The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $143 million and $105 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest liability will be paid to certain employees.  The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown.

BlackRock Solutions and Advisory

. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, enterprise investment system and financial markets advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name

BlackRock Solutions

and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation of illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for

BlackRock Solutions

and advisory services are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the

Aladdin

platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. The fees earned for

BlackRock Solutions

and advisory services are recorded in

BlackRock Solutions

and advisory on the consolidated statements of income.

Other Revenue

. The Company earns fees for transition management services comprised of commissions from acting as an introducing broker-dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of the Company’s customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur and are reflected in other revenue on the consolidated statements of income.

The Company earns commissions revenue upon the sale of unit trusts and Class A mutual funds. Revenue is recorded at the time of the sale of the product.

Other revenue also includes equity method investment earnings related to certain strategic investments.

Stock-based Compensation

. Entities are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The compensation cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period) in exchange for the stock-based award.

The Company measures the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) using the Company’s share price on the date of grant. For employee share options and instruments with market conditions, the Company uses pricing models. If an equity award is modified after the grant-date, incremental compensation cost is recognized for an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. Awards under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans vest over various periods. Compensation cost is recorded by the Company on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, multiple awards. Compensation cost is reduced by the number of awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting. Forfeiture estimates generally are derived using historical forfeiture information, where available, and are reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.

The Company amortizes the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation awards made to retirement-eligible employees over the requisite service period. Upon notification of retirement, the Company accelerates the unamortized portion of the award over the contractually required retirement notification period.

Distribution and Servicing Costs

. Distribution and servicing costs include payments to third parties, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs are expensed when incurred.

Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions

. The Company holds the rights to receive certain cash flows from sponsored mutual funds sold without a front-end sales charge (“back-end load shares”). The carrying value of these deferred mutual fund commissions is recorded within other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition and is being amortized over periods between one and six years. The Company receives distribution fees from these funds and contingent deferred sales commissions (“CDSCs”) upon shareholder redemption of certain back-end load shares that are recorded within distribution fees on the consolidated statements of income. Upon receipt of CDSCs, the Company records revenue and the remaining unamortized deferred sales commission is expensed.

Direct Fund Expenses

. Direct fund expenses, which are expensed as incurred, primarily consist of third-party nonadvisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of certain index trademarks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund.

Leases

. The Company accounts for its office facilities leases as operating leases, which may include escalation clauses. The Company expenses the lease payments associated with operating leases evenly during the lease term (including rent-free periods) commencing when the Company obtains the right to control the use of the leased property.

Foreign Exchange

. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are subsequently remeasured into the functional currencies of the Company's

F-13

subsidiaries at the rates prevailing at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on remeasurement are included in general and administration expense on the consolidated statements of income

.

Revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars

are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate componen

t of stockholders’ equity, on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Income Taxes

. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized on the consolidated statements of income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred income tax assets based upon expected future earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years, future deductibility of the asset, changes in applicable tax laws and other factors. If management determines that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance will be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in additional income tax expense. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax position.

Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation are recognized as additional paid-in capital and are reflected as financing cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows. If the Company does not have additional paid-in capital credits (cumulative tax benefits recorded to additional paid-in capital), the Company will record an expense for any deficit, or shortfall, between the recorded tax benefit and tax return benefit. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, BlackRock had excess additional paid-in capital credits to absorb potential future deficits between recorded tax benefits and tax return benefits.

Earnings per Share (“EPS”)

. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the treasury stock method.

Due to the similarities in terms between BlackRock’s nonvoting participating preferred stock and the Company’s common stock, the Company considers its nonvoting participating preferred stock to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of EPS calculations. As such, the Company has included the outstanding nonvoting participating preferred stock in the calculation of average basic and diluted shares outstanding.

Business Segments

. The Company’s management directs BlackRock’s operations as one business, the asset management business.  The Company utilizes a consolidated approach to assess performance and allocate resources. As such, the Company operates in one business segment as defined in ASC 280-10,

Segment Reporting

(“ASC 280-10”).

Fair Value Measurements.

Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs

.    The Company uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:

Level 1 Inputs:

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date.

•

Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds, ETFs, listed equities and certain exchange-traded derivatives.

Level 2 Inputs:

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price are observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies.

•

Level 2 assets may include debt securities, bank loans, short-term floating-rate notes, asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as over-the-counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3 Inputs:

Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include nonbinding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.

•

Level 3 assets may include direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds, investments in CLOs, bank loans and bonds.

•

Level 3 liabilities include contingent liabilities related to acquisitions valued based upon discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable market data. Level 3 liabilities at December 31, 2014 also included borrowings of consolidated CLOs valued based upon nonbinding single-broker quotes.

Significance of Inputs.

The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.

Valuation Techniques.

The fair values of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities were determined using various methodologies as appropriate, including third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes and market and income approaches. Such quotes and modeled prices are evaluated for

F-14

reasonableness through various procedures, including due diligence reviews of third-party pricing vendors, variance analyses, consideration of the current market environment and other analytical procedures.

A significant number of inputs used to value equity, debt securities and bank loans is sourced from third-party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRock’s internal valuation committee or other designated groups review both the valuation methodologies, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational processes with these vendors. On a quarterly basis, meetings are held with key vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors’ processes.

In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are nonbinding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input.

Investments Measured at Net Asset Values.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses NAV as the fair value for certain investments. The inputs to value these investments may include BlackRock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including distressed credit hedge funds, opportunistic funds, real estate and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. The various partnerships generally are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information from third-party sources, including independent appraisals. However, in some instances, current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third-party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third-party sources are not reliable. In these instances, fund management may perform model-based analytical valuations that may be used as an input to value these investments.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

.    The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of certain assets and liabilities, and market exposures for certain seed investments. The Company may also use derivatives within its separate account assets, which are segregated for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In addition, certain consolidated sponsored investment funds may also invest in derivatives as a part of their investment strategy.

Changes in the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings and, where applicable, are offset by the corresponding gain or loss on the related foreign-denominated assets or liabilities or hedged investments, on the consolidated statements of income.

The Company may also use financial instruments designated as net investment hedges for accounting purposes to hedge net investments in international subsidiaries whose functional currency is different from the reporting currency of the parent company. The gain or loss from revaluing accounting hedges of net investments in foreign operations at the spot rate is deferred and reported within accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company reassesses the effectiveness of its net investment hedge on a quarterly basis.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

3. Investments

A summary of the carrying value of total investments is as follows:

(1)

Amounts primarily include Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) Stock.

Available-for-Sale Investments

A summary of the cost and carrying value of investments classified as available-for-sale investments is as follows:

At December 31, 2015 available-for-sale investments primarily included investments in CLOs.  At December 31, 2014, available-for-sale investments primarily included seed investment in BlackRock sponsored mutual funds.

A summary of sale activity of available-for-sale securities during 2015, 2014 and 2013 is shown below.

Held-to-Maturity Investments

The carrying value of held-to-maturity investments was $108 million and $79 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Held-to-maturity investments included foreign government debt held primarily for regulatory purposes. The amortized cost (carrying value) of these investments approximated fair value. At December 31, 2015, $96 million of these investments mature in one year or less and $12 million mature after five years through ten years.

Trading Investments

A summary of the cost and carrying value of trading investments is as follows:

At December 31, 2015, trading investments included $437 million of debt securities and $263 million of equity securities held by consolidated sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs, $65 million of certain deferred compensation plan mutual fund investments and $20 million of other equity and debt securities.

F-16

At December 31, 2014, trading investments included $223 million of debt securities and $220 million of equity securities held by consolidated sponso

red investment funds accounted for as VREs, $64 million of certain deferred compensation plan mutual fund investments and $29 million of other equity and debt securities.

Other Investments

A summary of the cost and carrying value of other investments is as follows:

(1)

Carried interest related to VREs.

At December 31, 2014, consolidated sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs include third-party private equity funds, direct investments in private companies and third-party hedge funds held by BlackRock sponsored investment funds.

Equity method investments primarily include BlackRock’s direct investments in certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds. See Note 11,

Other Assets

, for more information on the Company’s investment in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc.  (“PennyMac”), which is included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Cost method investments include nonmarketable securities, primarily FRB stock, which is held for regulatory purposes and is restricted from sale. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no indicators of impairment on these investments.

Carried interest represents allocations to BlackRock’s general partner capital accounts from certain funds. These balances are subject to change upon cash distributions, additional allocations or reallocations back to limited partners within the respective funds.

4. Consolidated Voting Rights Entities

The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs because it is deemed to control such funds. The investments owned by these consolidated VREs are classified as trading or other investments. The following table presents the balances related to these consolidated VREs that were recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition, including BlackRock’s net interest in these funds:

BlackRock’s total exposure to consolidated VREs represents the value of its economic ownership interest in these sponsored investment funds. Valuation changes associated with investments held at fair value by these consolidated VREs are reflected in nonoperating income (expense) and partially offset in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the portion not attributable to BlackRock.

In addition, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, certain consolidated sponsored investment funds, which were accounted for as VIEs, were excluded from the balances in the table above as the balances for these investment products are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition. See Note 5,

Variable Interest Entities

, for further discussion on these consolidated investment products. See Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, for the Company’s consolidation policy and for further information on the adoption of ASU 2015-02.

The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated VREs to use in its operating activities.

5. Variable Interest Entities

In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, which may be considered VIEs. The Company may from time to time own equity or debt securities or enter into derivatives with the vehicles, each of which are considered variable interests. The Company’s involvement in financing the operations of the VIEs is generally limited to its investments in the entity. The Company consolidates entities when it is determined to be the PB. See Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, for further information on the Company’s accounting policy on consolidation.

F-17

As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-02, the Company deconsolidated all previously consolidated CLOs effective January 1, 2015 as its fees are no lon

ger deemed variable interests. The Company also consolidated certain investment products that were not previously consolidated. See Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies – Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2015

, for further information on ASU 2015-02.

Consolidated VIEs.

The Company’s consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2015 include certain sponsored investment funds in which BlackRock has an investment and as the investment manager, is deemed to have both the power to direct the most significant activities of the funds and the right to receive benefits (or the obligation to absorb losses) that could potentially be significant to these sponsored investment funds. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company. In addition, the investors in these VIEs have no recourse to the credit of the Company.

The Company’s consolidated VIEs under previous accounting guidance as of December 31, 2014 primarily included CLOs in which BlackRock did not have an investment; however, as the collateral manager, BlackRock was deemed to have both the power to direct the most significant activities of the CLOs and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the CLOs.

Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities are presented after intercompany eliminations at December 31, 2015 and 2014 in the following table:

The Company recorded a $58 million nonoperating net gain for 2015 related to consolidated VIEs. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related to consolidated VIEs for 2015 was $6 million.

The Company recorded $41 million of nonoperating expense and an equal and offsetting loss attributable to noncontrolling interests related to consolidated VIEs for 2014.  No gain or loss was recorded for 2013.

Non-Consolidated VIEs.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company’s carrying value of assets and liabilities included on the consolidated statements of financial condition pertaining to nonconsolidated VIEs and its maximum risk of loss related to VIEs for which it held a variable interest, but for which it was not the PB, was as follows:

(1)

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, BlackRock’s maximum risk of loss associated with these VIEs primarily related to collecting advisory fee receivables and BlackRock’s investments.

The net assets of sponsored investment products that are nonconsolidated VIEs approximated $3 billion at December 31, 2015. Net assets of other sponsored investment funds approximated $1.7 trillion to $1.8 trillion at December 31, 2014 and included approximately $1.4 trillion of collective trusts at December 31, 2014. Upon the adoption of ASU 2015-02, BlackRock no longer has a variable interest in collective trusts as BlackRock does not have any economic interest and earns at-market fees from these products.

Level 3 Assets.

Level 3 investments of consolidated VIEs of $196 million at December 31, 2015 and Level 3 investments of $80 million at December 31, 2014 related to direct investments in private equity companies held by private equity funds.  Direct investments in private equity companies may be valued using the market approach or the income approach, or a combination thereof, and were valued based on an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating evaluation of additional significant third-party financing, changes in valuations of comparable peer companies, the business environment of the companies, market indices, assumptions relating to appropriate risk adjustments for nonperformance and legal restrictions on disposition, among other factors. The fair value derived from the methods used is evaluated and weighted, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range of values indicated. Under the market approach, fair value may be determined by reference to multiples of market-comparable companies or transactions, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) multiples. Under the income approach, fair value may be determined by discounting the expected cash flows to a single present value amount using current expectations about those future amounts. Unobservable inputs used in a discounted cash flow model may include projections of operating performance generally covering a five-year period and a terminal value of the private equity direct investment. For investments utilizing the discounted cash flow valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate, risk premium or discount for lack of marketability in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. For investments utilizing the market comparable companies valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the EBITDA multiple in isolation could result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.

F-20

Level 3 assets may include bank loans, investments in CLOs

,

and bonds valued based on single-broker nonbinding quotes and direct private equity investments valued using the market approach or the income approach as described above.

Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities.

Realized and unrealized gains (losses) recorded for Level 3 assets and liabilities are reported in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. A portion of net income (loss) for consolidated sponsored investment funds are allocated to noncontrolling interests to reflect net income (loss) not attributable to the Company.

Transfers in and/or out of Levels.

Transfers in and/or out of levels are reflected when significant inputs, including market inputs or performance attributes, used for the fair value measurement become observable/unobservable, or when the carrying value of certain equity method investments no longer represents fair value as determined under valuation methodologies.

Assets of Consolidated VIEs

.

During 2014, there were $280 million of transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2 related to bank loans. In addition, in 2014, there were $302 million of transfers into Level 3 from Level 2 related to bank loans. These transfers in and out of levels were primarily due to availability/unavailability of observable market inputs, including inputs from pricing vendors and brokers.

Significant Issuances and Other Settlements.

During 2015, other settlements primarily included the impact of deconsolidating previously consolidated CLOs effective January 1, 2015 as a result of adopting ASU 2015-02. See Note 2,

In 2014, issuances and other settlements included $1,582 million of borrowings due to the consolidation of CLOs and $485 million of repayments of borrowings of consolidated CLOs.

Disclosures of Fair Value for Financial Instruments Not Held at Fair Value

. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments not held at fair value are categorized in the table below.

F-22

(1)

Cash and cash equivalents are carried at either cost or amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.

(2)

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately $132 million and $100 million, respectively, of money market funds were recorded within cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, at December 31, 2015, approximately $68 million of money market funds was recorded within cash and cash equivalents of consolidated VIEs.  Money market funds are valued based on quoted market prices, or $1.00 per share, which generally is the NAV of the fund.

(3)

The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.

(4)

Long-term borrowings are recorded at amortized cost, net of debt issuance costs. The fair value of the long-term borrowings, including the current portion of long-term borrowings, is estimated using market prices at the end of December 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 12,

Borrowings

, for the fair value of each of the Company’s long-term borrowings.

Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share

As a practical expedient to value certain investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and have attributes of an investment company, the Company uses NAV as the fair value. The following tables list information regarding all investments that use a fair value measurement to account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities in their calculation of a NAV per share (or equivalent).

December 31, 2015

December 31, 2014

N/R – not redeemable

(1)

Comprised of equity method investments, which include investment companies, which account for their financial assets and most financial liabilities under fair value measures; therefore, the Company’s investment in such equity method investees approximates fair value.

(a)

This category includes the underlying third-party private equity funds within consolidated BlackRock sponsored private equity funds of funds. The fair values of the investments in the third-party funds have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company’s ownership interest in each fund in the portfolio as well as other performance inputs. These investments are not subject to redemption; however, for certain funds, the Company may sell or transfer its interest, which may need approval by the general partner of the underlying funds. Due to the nature of the investments in this category, the Company reduces its investment by distributions that are received through the realization of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately five years and seven years at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total remaining unfunded commitments to other third-party funds were $19 million and $22 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company had contractual obligations to the consolidated funds of $31 million at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.

F-23

(b)

This category includes hedge funds and funds of hedge funds that invest p

rimarily in equities, fixed income securities, distressed credit, opportunistic and mortgage instruments and other third-party hedge funds. The fair values of the investments have been estimated using the NAV of the Company’s ownership interest in partners

’ capital. It was estimated that the investments in the funds that are not subject to redemption will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately one year and two years at December 31, 2015 and 2014,

respectively

.

(c)

This category includes several private equity funds that initially invest in nonmarketable securities of private companies, which ultimately may become public in the future. The fair values of these investments have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company’s ownership interest in the funds as well as other performance inputs. The Company’s investment in each fund is not subject to redemption and is normally returned through distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying assets of the private equity funds. It was estimated that the investments in these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately four years at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.

(d)

This category includes several real estate funds that invest directly in real estate and real estate related assets. The fair values of the investments have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company’s ownership interest in the funds. A majority of the Company’s investments are not subject to redemption or are not currently redeemable and are normally returned through distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying assets of the real estate funds. It is estimated that the investments in these funds not subject to redemptions will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately six years and seven years at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(e)

This category for 2015 primarily includes a multi-asset fund that is redeemable.  The fair values of the investments have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company’s ownership interest in partners’ capital.  In addition, for both 2014 and 2015, this category includes investments in several real estate funds.  The fair values of the investments have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company’s ownership interest in partners’ capital.  The investments are not subject to redemption; however, distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying assets will be used to settle certain deferred compensation liabilities over time.

(f)

This category includes the underlying third-party private equity funds within one consolidated BlackRock sponsored private equity fund of funds. The fair values of the investments in the third-party funds have been estimated using capital accounts representing the Company’s ownership interest in each fund in the portfolio as well as other performance inputs. These investments are not subject to redemption; however, for certain funds the Company may sell or transfer its interest, which may need approval by the general partner of the underlying third-party funds. Due to the nature of the investments in this category, the Company reduces its investment by distributions that are received through the realization of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over a weighted-average period of approximately one year at December 31, 2014.

Fair Value Option

.

As of December 31, 2015, assets for which the fair value option was elected were not material to the consolidated financial statements.

The following table summarizes information at December 31, 2014 related to those assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected:

At December 31, 2014, the principal amounts outstanding of the borrowings issued by the CLOs mature between 2016 and 2027.

During 2014 and 2013, the change in fair value of the bank loans and bonds held by the CLOs resulted in a $69 million and $153 million gain, respectively, which were offset by a $65 million and $117 million loss, respectively, from the change in fair value of the CLO borrowings.  The net gains (losses) were recorded in net gain (loss) on consolidated VIEs on the consolidated statements of income.

The change in fair value of the assets and liabilities included interest income and expense, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2015, the Company no longer consolidates CLOs due to the adoption of ASU 2015-02. See Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, for further information.

N/A

– Not Applicable

Qualifying software costs of approximately $48 million, $45 million and $35 million have been capitalized within equipment and computer software during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are being amortized over an estimated useful life of three years.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $115 million, $117 million and $128 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

9. Goodwill

Goodwill activity during 2015 and 2014 was as follows:

(1)

In 2015, amount represents $113 million of goodwill from the Company’s acquisition of FutureAdvisor, which expanded the Company’s digital wealth management capabilities, $49 million of goodwill from the Company’s acquisition of Infraestructura Institucional, which expanded the Company’s infrastructure capabilities in Mexico, and $19 million of goodwill from the Company’s acquisition of certain assets related to BKCA.  The total consideration paid for these acquisitions was approximately $300 million, including $27 million of contingent consideration at fair value at time of close.

(


)

The decrease in goodwill during both 2015 and 2014 primarily resulted from a decline related to tax benefits realized from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill from the acquisition of the fund-of-funds business of Quellos Group, LLC in October 2007 (the “Quellos Transaction”). Goodwill related to the Quellos Transaction will continue to be reduced in future periods by the amount of tax benefits realized from tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill from the Quellos Transaction. The balance of the Quellos tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill was approximately $231 million and $263 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

BlackRock assessed its goodwill for impairment as of July 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and considered such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s common stock closed at a market price of $340.52, which exceeded its book value of approximately $172.12 per share.

On May 8, 2013, PennyMac became the sole managing member of PNMAC in connection with an initial public offering of PennyMac (the “PennyMac IPO”). As a result of the 2013 PennyMac IPO, BlackRock recorded a noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $39 million related to the carrying value of its equity method investment.

Subsequent to the PennyMac IPO, in 2013 the Company contributed 6.1 million units of its PennyMac investment to a new donor advised fund (the “Charitable Contribution”). The fair value of the Charitable Contribution was $124 million and is included in general and administration expense on the consolidated statements of income for 2013. In connection with the Charitable Contribution, the Company also recorded a noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed investment and a tax benefit of approximately $48 million.

In April 2015, the Company’s credit facility was further amended to extend the maturity date to March 2020 and to increase the amount of the aggregate commitment to $4.0 billion (the “2015 credit facility”). The 2015 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2015 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2015 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2015. The 2015 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2015, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2015 credit facility.

Commercial Paper Program.

From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. federal, state governmental and domestic and international regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. It is BlackRock’s policy to cooperate fully with such inquiries. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Additionally, BlackRock advised investment portfolios may be subject to lawsuits, any of which potentially could harm the investment returns of the applicable portfolio or result in the Company being liable to the portfolios for any resulting damages.

On May 27, 2014, certain purported investors in the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund, Inc. and the BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund (collectively, the “Funds”) filed a consolidated complaint (the “Consolidated Complaint”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against BlackRock Advisors, LLC, BlackRock Investment Management, LLC and BlackRock International Limited (collectively, the “Defendants”) under the caption

In re BlackRock Mutual Funds Advisory Fee Litigation

. The Consolidated Complaint, which purports to be brought derivatively on behalf of the Funds, alleges that the Defendants violated Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act by receiving

F-28

allegedly excessive investment advisory fees from the

Funds. On February 24, 2015, the same plaintiffs filed another complaint in the same court against BlackRock Investment Management, LLC and BlackRock Advisors, LLC. The allegations and legal claims in both complaints are substantially similar, with the ne

w complaint purporting to challenge fees received by Defendants after the plaintiffs filed their prior complaint. Both complaints seek, among other things, to recover on behalf of the Funds all allegedly excessive advisory fees received by Defendants in th

e twelve month period preceding the start of each lawsuit, along with purported lost investment returns on those amounts, plus interest. On March 25, 2015, Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint was denied. The Defendants believe the clai

ms in both lawsuits are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions.

Between November 12, 2015 and November 16, 2015, BlackRock, Inc., BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (“BRA”) and the BlackRock Granite Property Fund, Inc. (“Granite Fund”), along with certain other Granite Fund-related entities (collectively, the “BlackRock Parties”) were named as defendants in thirteen separate lawsuits filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Alameda arising out of the June 16, 2015 collapse of a balcony at the Library Gardens apartment complex in Berkeley, California (the “Property”). The Property is indirectly owned by the Granite Fund, which is managed by BRA. The plaintiffs also named as defendants in the lawsuits Greystar, which is the property manager of the Property, and certain other entities, including the developer of the Property, building contractors and building materials suppliers. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the BlackRock Parties were negligent in their ownership, control and maintenance of the Property’s balcony, and seek monetary, including punitive, damages. The Company believes the claims in the lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions.

Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material effect on BlackRock’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, there is no assurance as to whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material effect on BlackRock’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows in any future reporting period. Due to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of these matters, management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters.

Indemnifications.

In the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote. Consequently, no liability has been recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

In connection with securities lending transactions, BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. At December 31, 2015, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $169.3 billion. The Company held as agent, cash and securities totaling $179.6 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2015. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at December 31, 2015.

14. Stock-Based Compensation

The components of stock-based compensation expense are as follows:

Stock Award and Incentive Plan.

Pursuant to the BlackRock, Inc. Second Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the “Award Plan”), options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price not less than the market value of BlackRock’s common stock on the date of grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock or RSUs may be granted to employees and nonemployee directors. A maximum of 34,500,000 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the Award Plan. Of this amount, 7,621,046 shares remain available for future awards at December 31, 2015. Upon exercise of employee stock options, the issuance of restricted stock or the vesting of RSUs, the Company issues shares out of treasury to the extent available.

Restricted Stock and RSUs.

Pursuant to the Award Plan, restricted stock grants and RSUs may be granted to certain employees. Substantially all restricted stock and RSUs vest over periods ranging from one to three years and are expensed using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

Restricted stock and RSU activity for 2015 is summarized below.

(1)

At December 31, 2015, approximately 2.8 million awards are expected to vest and 0.2 million awards have vested but have not been converted.

F-29

The Company values restricted stock and RSUs at their

grant-date fair value as measured by BlackRock’s common stock price. The total fair market value of RSUs

/restricted stock

granted to employees during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $


million, $472 million and $390

million, respectively. The total fair market value of RSUs

/restricted stock

converted to common stock during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $


million, $534 million and $528 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2015, the intrinsic value of outstanding RSUs was $1.0 billion, reflecting a closing stock price of $340.52 at December 31, 2015.

RSUs/restricted stock granted under the Award Plan primarily related to the following:

In addition the Company also granted RSUs of 120,935, 166,018 and 117,339 during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

At December 31, 2015, there was $305 million in total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 0.9 years.

In January 2016, the Company granted under the Award Plan

•

1,030,964 RSUs or shares of restricted stock to employees as part of annual incentive compensation that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant; and

•

303,587 RSUs or shares of restricted stock to employees that cliff vest 100% on January 31, 2019.

Market Performance-based RSUs.

Pursuant to the Award Plan, market performance-based RSUs may be granted to certain employees. The market performance-based RSUs require that separate 15%, 25% and 35% share price appreciation targets be achieved during the six-year term of the awards. The awards are split into three tranches and each tranche may vest if the specified target increase in share price is met. Eligible vesting dates for each tranche are January 31 (or, if such date is not a business day, the next following business day) of the year in which the fourth, fifth or sixth anniversaries of the grant-date occurs. Certain awards are forfeited if the employee leaves BlackRock before the vesting date. These awards are amortized over a service period of four years, which is the longer of the explicit service period or the period in which the market target is expected to be met. Market performance-based RSUs are not considered participating securities as the dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting of the award. During 2015 there were no market performance-based awards granted.  In 2014 and 2013, the Company granted 315,961 and 556,581 market performance-based RSUs, respectively.  The 2013 grant will be funded primarily by shares currently held by PNC (see

Long-Term Incentive Plans

Funded by PNC

below).

Market performance-based RSU activity for 2015 is summarized below.

(1)

At December 31, 2015, approximately 1.3 million awards are expected to vest and an immaterial amount of awards have vested and have not been converted.

At December 31, 2015, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested market performance-based awards was $47 million. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 0.9 years.

At December 31, 2015, the intrinsic value of outstanding market performance-based awards was $469 million reflecting a closing stock price of $340.52.

The grant-date fair value of the awards was

$62 million in 2014 and $71 million in 2013. The fair value was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation with the following assumptions:

Grant

Risk-Free

Interest

25.85

The Company’s expected stock volatility assumption was based upon an average of the historical stock price fluctuations of BlackRock’s common stock and an implied volatility at the grant-date. The dividend yield assumption was derived using estimated dividends over the expected term and the stock price at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield at date of grant.

F-30

Performance-Based RSUs.

Pursuant to the

Award Plan

, performance-based RSUs may be granted to certain employees. Each performance-based award consists of a “base” number of RSUs granted to the employee. The number of share

s that an employee ultimately receives at vesting will be equal to the base number of performance-based RSUs granted, multiplied by a predetermined percentage determined in accordance with the level of attainment of Company performance measures during the

performance period and could be higher or lower than the original RSU grant. The awards are generally forfeited if the employee leaves the Company before the vesting date. Performance-based RSUs are not considered participating securities as the dividend e

quivalents are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting of the award.

In January 2015, the Company granted 262,847 performance-based RSUs to certain employees that cliff vest 100% on January 31, 2018. These awards are amortized over a service period of three years.  The number of shares distributed at vesting could be higher or lower than the original grant based on the level of attainment of predetermined Company performance measures.

Performance-based RSU activity for 2015 is summarized below.

At December 31, 2015, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested performance-based awards was $59 million.  The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 2.1 years.

The Company values performance-based RSUs at their grant-date fair value as measured by BlackRock’s common stock price. The total grant-date fair market value of performance-based RSUs expected to vest was $90 million.

At December 31, 2015, the intrinsic value of outstanding performance-based RSUs was $87 million reflecting a closing stock price of $340.52.

In January 2016, the Company granted 375,242 performance-based RSUs to certain employees that cliff vest 100% on January 31, 2019. These awards are amortized over a service period of three years.  The number of shares distributed at vesting could be higher or lower than the original grant based on the level of attainment of predetermined Company performance measures.

Long-Term Incentive Plans Funded by PNC.

Under a share surrender agreement, PNC committed to provide up to 4 million shares of BlackRock stock, held by PNC, to fund certain BlackRock long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”). The current share surrender agreement commits PNC to provide BlackRock series C nonvoting participating preferred stock to fund the remaining committed shares. As of December 31, 2015, 2.7 million shares had been surrendered by PNC.

At December 31, 2015, the remaining shares committed by PNC of 1.3 million were available to fund certain future long-term incentive awards.

In January 2016, 548,277 shares were surrendered by PNC.

Stock Options.

Stock option grants were made to certain employees pursuant to the Award Plan in 1999 through 2007. Options granted have a ten-year life, vested ratably over periods ranging from two to five years and became exercisable upon vesting. The Company has not granted any stock options subsequent to the January 2007 grant, which vested on September 29, 2011. Stock option activity for 2015 is summarized below.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $128 million, $4 million and $19 million, respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable shares was $27 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting a closing stock price of $340.52.  The weighted average remaining life of the options outstanding at December 31, 2015 was approximately one year.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had no remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).

The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase the Company’s common stock at 95% of the fair market value on the last day of each three-month offering period. The Company does not record compensation expense related to employees purchasing shares under the ESPP.

15. Employee Benefit Plans

Deferred Compensation Plans

Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan.

The Company adopted a Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan (“VDCP”) that allows eligible employees in the United States to elect to defer between 1% and 100% of their annual cash incentive compensation. The participants must specify a deferral period of up to 10 years from the year of deferral and additionally, elect to receive distributions in the form of a lump sum or in up to 10 annual installments. The Company may fund the obligation through the rabbi trust on behalf of the plan’s participants.

F-31

The rabbi trust established for the VDCP, with

assets totaling

$6


million at

both

December 31, 2015 and 2014, is reflected in

investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Such investments are classified as trading investments. The corresponding liability balance of $


million and $78 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is reflected on the

consolidated statements of financial condition as accrued compensation and benefits. Earnings in the rabbi trust, including unrealized appreciation or depreciation, are reflected as nonoperating income (expense) and changes in the corresponding liability a

re reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income.

Other Deferred Compensation Plans.

The Company has additional compensation plans for the purpose of providing deferred compensation and retention incentives to certain employees. For these plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed in cash upon vesting is associated with investment returns of certain investment funds. The liabilities for these plans were $178 million and $126 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition as accrued compensation and benefits. In January 2016, the Company granted approximately $151 million of additional deferred compensation that will fluctuate with investment returns and will vest ratably over three years from the date of grant.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company has several defined contribution plans primarily in the United States and United Kingdom.

Certain of the Company’s U.S. employees participate in a defined contribution plan (“U.S. Plan”). Employee contributions of up to 8% of eligible compensation, as defined by the plan and subject to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) limitations, are matched by the Company at 50% up to a maximum of $5,000 annually. In addition, the Company makes an annual retirement contribution to eligible participants equal to 3-5% of eligible compensation. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company’s contribution expense related to the U.S. Plan was $72 million, $67 million and $63 million, respectively.

Certain U.K. wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company contribute to a defined contribution plan for their employees (“U.K. Plan”).  The contributions range between 6% and 15% of each employee’s eligible compensation. The Company’s contribution expense related to this plan was $33 million in both 2015 and 2014, and $29 million in 2013.

In addition, the contribution expense related to defined contribution plans in other regions was $18 million in 2015 and 2014, and 2013.

Defined Benefit Plans.

The Company has several defined benefit pension plans primarily in Japan and Germany. All accrued benefits under the Germany defined benefit plan are currently frozen and the plan is closed to new participants. The participant benefits under the Germany plan will not change with salary increases or additional years of service. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the plan assets for both these plans were approximately $22 million and $21 million, respectively. The underfunded obligations at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were not material. Benefit payments for the next five years and in aggregate for the five years thereafter are not expected to be material.

16. Related Party Transactions

Determination of Related Parties

PNC.

The Company considers PNC, along with its affiliates, to be related parties based on the level of its ownership of BlackRock capital stock. At December 31, 2015, PNC owned approximately 21.1% of the Company’s voting common stock and held approximately 22.2% of the total capital stock.

Registered Investment Companies and Equity Method Investments.

The Company considers the registered investment companies that it manages, which include mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, to be related parties as a result of the Company’s advisory relationship. In addition, equity method investments are considered related parties, due to the Company’s influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee.

Revenue from Related Parties

Receivables and Payables with Related Parties.

Due from related parties, which is included within other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition was $73 million and $89 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and primarily represented receivables from certain investment products managed by BlackRock. Accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 and 2014 included $705 million and $747 million, respectively, related to receivables from BlackRock mutual funds, including

iShares

, for investment advisory and administration services.

Due to related parties, which is included within other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition, was $18 million and $12 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and primarily represented payables to certain investment products managed by BlackRock.

17. Net Capital Requirements

The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.

Banking Regulatory Requirements.

BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is chartered as a national bank whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Under the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, BTC must meet specific capital guidelines that invoke quantitative measures of BTC’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under the regulatory accounting practices. BTC’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require BTC to maintain a minimum Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 leverage ratio, as well as Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios. Based on BTC’s calculations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, it exceeded the applicable capital adequacy requirements.

(1)

Ratios and amounts as of December 31, 2015 reflect the adoption of revised capital rules effective January 1, 2015.

F-33

Broker-dealers.

BlackRock Investments, LLC and BlackRock Execution Services are registered broker-dealers and wholly owned subsidiaries of BlackRock that are subject to the Uniform Net Capital requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires mainten

ance of certain minimum net capital levels.

Capital Requirements.

At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.1 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.

F-34

The Company’s common and preferred shares issued and outstanding an

d related activity consist of the following:

20. Income Taxes

The components of income tax expense for 2015, 2014 and 2013, are as follows:

Income tax expense has been based on the following components of income before taxes, less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests:

The foreign income before taxes includes countries that have statutory tax rates that are lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, such as the United Kingdom, Channel Islands, Canada and the Netherlands.

A reconciliation of income tax expense with expected federal income tax expense computed at the applicable federal income tax rate of 35% is as follows:

Deferred income taxes are provided for the effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years.

F-35

The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities are shown below

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded net when related to the same tax jurisdiction. At December 31, 2015, the Company recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition deferred income tax assets, within other assets, and deferred income tax liabilities of

$20 million and $4,851 million, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the Company recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition deferred income tax assets, within other assets, and deferred income tax liabilities of $10 million and $4,989 million, respectively.

During 2015, tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and domestic state and local tax changes resulted in a $54 million net noncash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities. During 2014, state and local tax changes resulted in a $4 million net noncash benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had available state net operating loss carryforwards of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2017. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $135 million and $137 million, respectively, of which $6 million will begin to expire in 2017 and the balance will carry forward indefinitely. At December 31, 2015, the Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of $83 million which will begin to expire in 2023.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $20 million and $29 million of valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, respectively, recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The year-over-year decrease in the valuation allowance primarily related to the realization of tax loss carryforwards and certain foreign deferred income tax assets.

Goodwill recorded in connection with the Quellos Transaction has been reduced during the period by the amount of tax benefit realized from tax-deductible goodwill. See Note 9,

Goodwill

, for further discussion.

Current income taxes are recorded net on the consolidated statements of financial condition when related to the same tax jurisdiction. At December 31, 2015, the Company had current income taxes receivable and payable of $166 million and $79 million, respectively, recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the Company had current income taxes receivable and payable of $117 million and $125 million, respectively, recorded in other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively.

The Company does not provide deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over tax basis on its investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. The excess totaled $4,734 million and $3,871 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The determination of the additional deferred income taxes on the excess has not been provided because it is not practicable due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

The following tabular reconciliation presents the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits:

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are $320 million, $283 million and $304 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, the Company accrued interest and penalties of $12 million during 2015 and in total, as of December 31, 2015, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $56 million. The Company accrued interest and penalties of $(25) million during 2014 and in total, as of December 31, 2014, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $44 million. The Company accrued interest

F-36

and penalties of $(1) million during 2013 and in total, as of December 31, 2013, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $68 million.

BlackRock is subject to U.S. federal income tax, state and local income tax, and foreign income tax in multiple jurisdictions. Tax years after 2009 remain open to U.S. federal income tax examination.

In June 2014, the IRS commenced its examination of BlackRock’s 2010 through 2012 tax years, and while the impact on the consolidated financial statements is undetermined, it is not expected to be material.

The Company is currently under audit in several state and local jurisdictions. The significant state and local income tax examinations are in New York State and New York City for tax years 2009 through 2011, and New Jersey for tax years 2007 through 2009. No state and local income tax audits cover years earlier than 2007.  No state and local income tax audits are expected to result in an assessment material to BlackRock’s consolidated financial statements.

Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs’ (“HMRC”) United Kingdom income tax audit for various U.K. BlackRock subsidiaries is in progress for tax years 2009 and forward. While the impact on the consolidated financial statements is undetermined, it is not expected to be material.

At December 31, 2015, it is reasonably possible the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change within the next twelve months due to completion of tax authorities’ exams or the expiration of statues of limitations. Management estimates that the existing liability for uncertain tax positions could decrease by approximately $13 million to $33 million within the next twelve months.

21. Earnings Per Share

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS for 2015, 2014 and 2013 under the treasury stock method:

There were no anti-dilutive RSUs for 2015 and 2013. Amounts of anti-dilutive RSUs for 2014 were immaterial. In addition, there were no anti-dilutive stock options for 2015, 2014 and 2013.

22. Segment Information

The Company’s management directs BlackRock’s operations as one business, the asset management business.  The Company utilizes a consolidated approach to assess performance and allocate resources. As such, the Company operates in one business segment as defined in ASC 280-10.
