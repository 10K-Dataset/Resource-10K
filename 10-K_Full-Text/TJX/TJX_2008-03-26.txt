PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Business
    Overview

We are the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home
    fashions in the United States and worldwide. Our T.J. Maxx,
    Marshalls and A.J. Wright chains in the United States, our
    Winners chain in Canada, and our T.K. Maxx chain in Europe sell
    off-price family apparel and home fashions. Our HomeGoods chain
    in the United States and our HomeSense chain, operated by
    Winners in Canada, sell off-price home fashions. The target
    customer for all of our off-price chains, except A.J. Wright, is
    the middle-to upper-middle income shopper, with the same profile
    as a department or specialty store customer. A.J. Wright targets
    the moderate-income customer. Our seven off-price chains are
    synergistic in their philosophies and operating platforms. Our
    eighth chain, Bob’s Stores, was acquired in December 2003
    and is a value-oriented, branded apparel chain based in the
    Northeastern United States that offers casual, family apparel.
    Bob’s Stores’ target customer demographic spans the
    moderate-to upper-middle income bracket.

Our off-price mission is to deliver an exciting, fresh and
    rapidly changing assortment of brand-name merchandise at
    excellent values to our customers. We define value as the
    combination of quality, brand, fashion and price. With over 500
    buyers, 10,000 vendors worldwide and over 2,500 stores, we
    believe we are well positioned to continue accomplishing this
    goal. Our key strengths include:

—

synergistic businesses with flexible, resilient business models

—

history of growth in various types of retail environments

—

expertise in off-price buying

—

substantial buying power

—

track record of successful expansion into new geographies and
    merchandise categories

—

solid relationships with many manufacturers and other
    merchandise suppliers

—

deep organization with decades of experience in off-price
    retailing as well as other forms of retailing

—

inventory management systems and distribution networks specific
    to our off-price business model

—

financial strength and excellent credit rating

As an off-price retailer, we offer quality, name brand and
    designer family apparel and home fashions every day at
    substantial savings to comparable department and specialty store
    regular prices. We can offer these everyday savings as a result
    of our opportunistic buying strategies, disciplined inventory
    management, including rapid inventory turns, and low expense
    structure.

In our off-price apparel chains, we purchase the majority of our
    inventory opportunistically. Opportunistic purchases are also a
    significant factor in our home fashion businesses but to a
    lesser extent. In contrast to traditional retailers that order
    goods far in advance of the time they appear on the selling
    floor, TJX buyers are in the marketplace virtually every week,
    buying primarily for the current selling season. By maintaining
    a liquid inventory position, our buyers can buy close to need,
    enabling them to buy into current market trends and take
    advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace. Due to the
    unpredictable nature of consumer demand in the highly fragmented
    apparel and home fashions marketplace and the mismatch of supply
    and demand, we are regularly able to buy the vast majority of
    our inventory directly from manufacturers, with some merchandise
    coming from other retailers and other sources. We purchase
    virtually all of our inventory for our off-price stores at
    discounts from initial wholesale prices. Although we generally
    purchase merchandise for our off-price chains to sell in the
    current season, we purchase a limited quantity of pack away
    merchandise that we buy specifically to warehouse and sell in a
    future selling season. We are willing to purchase less than a
    full assortment of styles and sizes. We pay promptly and do not
    ask for typical retail concessions in our off-price chains such
    as advertising, promotional and markdown allowances, or delivery
    concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed
    deliveries or return privileges. Our financial strength, strong
    reputation and ability to purchase large quantities of
    merchandise and sell it through our geographically diverse
    network of stores provide us excellent access to leading branded
    merchandise. Our opportunistic buying permits us to consistently
    offer our customers in our off-price chains a rapidly changing
    merchandise assortment at everyday values that are below
    department and specialty store regular prices.

We are extremely disciplined in our inventory management, and we
    rapidly turn the inventory in our off-price chains. We rely
    heavily on sophisticated, internally developed inventory systems
    and controls that permit a virtually continuous flow of
    merchandise into our stores and an expansive distribution
    infrastructure that supports our close-to-need buying by
    delivering goods to our stores quickly and efficiently. For
    example, highly automated storage and distribution systems



track, allocate and deliver an average of approximately 11,000
    items per week to each T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store. In
    addition, specialized computer inventory planning, purchasing
    and monitoring systems, coupled with warehouse storage,
    processing, handling and shipping systems, permit a continuous
    evaluation and rapid replenishment of store inventory. Pricing,
    markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment
    requirements are determined centrally, using information
    provided by point-of-sale computer terminals and are designed to
    move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined
    manner. These inventory management and distribution systems
    allow us to achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover on a vast
    array of product and sell substantially all merchandise within
    targeted selling periods.

We operate with a low cost structure relative to many other
    retailers. Our stores are generally located in community
    shopping centers. While we seek to provide a pleasant, easy
    shopping environment with an emphasis on customer convenience,
    we do not spend heavily on store fixtures. Our selling floor
    space is flexible, without walls between departments and largely
    free of permanent fixtures, so we can easily expand and contract
    departments in response to customer demand, available
    merchandise and fashion trends. Also, our large retail presence,
    strong financial position and expertise in the real estate
    market allow us generally to obtain favorable lease terms. In
    our off-price chains, our advertising budget as a percentage of
    sales remains low compared to traditional department and
    specialty stores. Our high

sales-per-square-foot

productivity and rapid inventory turnover also provide expense
    efficiencies.

With all of our off-price chains operating with the same
    off-price strategies and systems, we are able to capitalize upon
    expertise, best practices, initiatives and new ideas across our
    chains, develop associates by transferring them from one chain
    to another, and grow our various businesses more efficiently and
    effectively.

During the fiscal year ended January 26, 2008, we derived
    77% of our sales from the United States, including Puerto Rico
    (27% from the Northeast, 13% from the Midwest, 22% from the
    South, 1% from the Central Plains, 13% from the West and 1% from
    Puerto Rico) and 23% from foreign countries (11% from Canada,
    12% from Europe (the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany)). By
    merchandise category, we derived approximately 63% of our sales
    from apparel (including footwear), 25% from home fashions and
    12% from jewelry and accessories.

We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. The
    T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store chains are managed as one
    division, referred to as Marmaxx, and are reported as a single
    segment. The Winners and HomeSense chains, which operate
    exclusively in Canada, are also managed as one division and are
    reported as a single segment. Each of our other store chains,
    T.K. Maxx, HomeGoods, A.J. Wright, and Bob’s Stores is
    operated as a division and reported as a separate segment. More
    detailed information about our segments, including financial
    information for each of the last three fiscal years, can be
    found in Note O to the consolidated financial statements.

Unless otherwise indicated, all store information is as of
    January 26, 2008, and references to store square footage
    are to gross square feet. Fiscal 2006 means the fiscal year
    ended January 28, 2006, fiscal 2007 means the fiscal year
    ended January 27, 2007, fiscal 2008 means the fiscal year
    ended January 26, 2008 and fiscal 2009 means the fiscal
    year ending January 31, 2009.

Segment
    Overview

MARMAXX
    (T.J. MAXX AND MARSHALLS)

Marmaxx operates the largest off-price retailers in the United
    States, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, with 847 T.J. Maxx stores in
    48 states and 762 Marshalls stores in 42 states
    and 14 in Puerto Rico, at fiscal 2008 year-end. We maintain
    the separate identities of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores
    through product assortment, in-store initiatives, marketing and
    store appearance. This encourages our customers to shop at both
    chains.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls primarily target female shoppers who
    have families with middle to upper-middle incomes and who
    generally fit the profile of a department or specialty store
    customer. These chains operate with a common buying and
    merchandising organization and have a consolidated
    administrative function, including finance and human resources.
    The combined organization, known internally as The Marmaxx
    Group, offers us increased leverage to purchase merchandise at
    favorable prices and allows us to operate with a lower cost
    structure. These advantages are key to our ability to sell
    quality, brand name merchandise at substantial discounts from
    department and specialty store regular prices.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls sell quality, brand name and designer
    merchandise at prices generally 20%-60% below department and
    specialty store regular prices. Both chains offer family
    apparel, accessories, giftware, and home fashions. Within these
    broad categories, T.J. Maxx offers a shoe assortment for women
    and fine jewelry, while Marshalls offers a full-line footwear
    department and a larger men’s department. We believe these
    expanded offerings further differentiate the shopping experience
    at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, driving traffic to both chains.



T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are generally located in suburban
    community shopping centers. T.J. Maxx stores average
    approximately 30,000 square feet. Marshalls stores average
    approximately 32,000 square feet. We currently expect to
    add a net of approximately 45 stores in fiscal 2009. Ultimately,
    we believe that T.J. Maxx and Marshalls together can operate
    approximately 2,000 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico,
    an increase of approximately 200 stores over our previous
    estimate.

HOMEGOODS

HomeGoods is our off-price retail chain that sells exclusively
    home fashions with a broad array of giftware, home basics,
    accent furniture, lamps, rugs, accessories, children’s
    furniture, and seasonal merchandise for the home. Many of the
    HomeGoods stores are stand-alone stores; however, we also
    combine HomeGoods stores with a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls store in
    a superstore format, the majority of which are dual-branded,
    with both the T.J. Maxx or Marshalls logo and the HomeGoods
    logo. In fiscal 2008, we continued to open a different
    superstore format, called a “combo store,” in which a
    HomeGoods store is located beside a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls
    store, with interior passageways providing access between the
    stores. This configuration is also dual-branded with both the
    T.J. Maxx or Marshalls logo and the HomeGoods logo.

Stand-alone HomeGoods stores average approximately
    27,000 square feet. In superstores, which average
    approximately 53,000 square feet, we dedicate an average of
    22,000 square feet to HomeGoods. The 289 stores open at the
    end of fiscal 2008 include 156 stand-alone stores, 105
    superstores and 28 combo stores. In fiscal 2009, we plan to
    net 25 additional stores. We believe that the
    U.S. market could potentially support approximately 550 to
    600 HomeGoods stores in the long term.

WINNERS
    AND HOMESENSE

Winners is the leading off-price retailer in Canada, offering
    off-price brand name and designer family apparel, accessories,
    including fine jewelry, home fashions and giftware. Winners
    operates HomeSense, our Canadian off-price home fashions chain,
    launched in fiscal 2001. Like our HomeGoods chain, HomeSense
    offers a wide and rapidly changing assortment of off-price home
    fashions including giftware, home basics, accent furniture,
    lamps, rugs, accessories and seasonal merchandise. We operate
    HomeSense in a stand-alone format, as well as a superstore
    format where a HomeSense store and a Winners store are combined
    or operate

side-by-side.

At fiscal 2008 year end, we operated 191 Winners stores,
    which averaged approximately 29,000 square feet and 71
    HomeSense stores, which averaged approximately
    24,000 square feet. We expect to add a net of 16 stores in
    Canada in fiscal 2009, in the stand-alone and superstore format
    as well as the introduction of a new off-price concept.
    Ultimately, we believe the Canadian market can support
    approximately 230 Winners stores and approximately 80 HomeSense
    stores.

T.K.
    MAXX

T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany,
    is the only major off-price retailer in any European country.
    T.K. Maxx utilizes the same off-price strategies employed by
    T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and Winners and offers the same types of
    merchandise. At the end of fiscal 2008, we operated 221 T.K.
    Maxx stores in the U.K. and Ireland and 5 in Germany, which
    averaged approximately 31,000 square feet. We expect to add
    a total of 10 T.K. Maxx stores in the U.K. and Ireland in fiscal
    2009 and believe that the U.K. and Ireland can support
    approximately 275 stores in the long term. In the fall of fiscal
    2008, we opened our first 5 T.K. Maxx stores in Germany, and we
    expect to open an additional 5 stores in Germany in fiscal 2009
    for a total of 10 stores in that country by the end of the year.
    Additionally, T.K. Maxx expects to open its first 5 HomeSense
    stores in the U.K. in fiscal 2009, which will mark the launch of
    our Canadian HomeSense concept in Europe.

A.J.
    WRIGHT

A.J. Wright offers our off-price concept to the moderate income
    customer demographic, which differentiates this chain from our
    other off-price divisions. A.J. Wright stores offer brand-name
    family apparel, including accessories and footwear, as well as
    home fashions and giftware, including toys and games, and
    special, opportunistic purchases. A.J. Wright stores average
    approximately 26,000 square feet. We operated 129 A.J.
    Wright stores in the United States at fiscal 2008 year end.
    In fiscal 2009, we anticipate opening a net of 5 stores in
    existing markets. Although we are continuing to temper the rate
    at which we grow this chain, we believe that the customer
    demographics of the A.J. Wright concept could ultimately support
    approximately 1,000 A.J. Wright stores in the U.S.

BOB’S
    STORES

Bob’s Stores, acquired in late 2003, offers casual, family
    apparel and footwear, including workwear, activewear, and
    licensed team apparel. Bob’s Stores’ customer
    demographics span the moderate to upper-middle income bracket.
    Bob’s Stores operated 34 stores at the end of fiscal 2008,
    with an average size of 46,000 square feet. We do not plan
    to open any new stores for this division in fiscal 2009 as we
    continue to evaluate this business.

Other
    Information

EMPLOYEES

At January 26, 2008, we had approximately
    129,000 employees, many of whom work less than
    40 hours per week. In addition, we hire temporary employees
    during the peak back-to-school and holiday seasons.

CREDIT

Our stores operate primarily on a

cash-and-carry

basis. Each chain accepts credit sales through programs offered
    by banks and others. Our co-branded TJX card program for our
    domestic divisions offered by a major bank expired
    January 31, 2007, as scheduled. We now offer a new
    co-branded TJX credit card program, as well as a private label
    customer credit card with a different major bank. We do not
    maintain customer credit receivables related to either program.
    The rewards program associated with these credit cards is
    partially funded by TJX.

BUYING
    AND DISTRIBUTION

We operate a centralized buying organization that services both
    the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, while each of our other
    chains has its own centralized buying organization. All of our
    chains are serviced through their own distribution networks,
    including the use of third party providers at our HomeGoods and
    Winners divisions.

TRADEMARKS

We have the right to use our principal trademarks and service
    marks, which are T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners,
    HomeSense, T.K. Maxx, A.J. Wright and Bob’s Stores, in
    relevant countries. Our rights in these trademarks and service
    marks endure for as long as they are used.

SEASONALITY

Our business is subject to seasonal influences, which causes us
    generally to realize higher levels of sales and income in the
    second half of the year. This is common in the apparel retail
    business.

COMPETITION

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly
    competitive. We compete on the basis of fashion, quality, price,
    value, merchandise selection and freshness, brand name
    recognition and, to a lesser degree, store location. We compete
    with local, regional, national and international department,
    specialty, off-price, discount and outlet stores as well as
    other retailers



that sell apparel, accessories, home fashions, giftware and
    other merchandise that we sell, whether in stores, through
    catalogues or media or over the internet. We purchase most of
    our inventory opportunistically and compete for that merchandise
    with other off-price apparel and outlet retailers. We also
    compete with other retailers for associates and for store
    locations.

ITEM 1A. RISK
    FACTORS

The statements in this Section describe the major risks to our
    business and should be considered carefully, in connection with
    all of the other information set forth in this annual report on

Form 10-K.

In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary
    statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
    1995.

Our disclosure and analysis in this 2007

Form 10-K

and in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders contain some
    forward-looking statements, including some of the statements
    made under Item 1, “Business,” Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8,
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and in
    our 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders under “Letter to
    Shareholders” and “Financial Graphs.” From time
    to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other
    materials we release to the public as well as oral
    forward-looking statements. Such statements give our current
    expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate
    strictly to historical or current facts. We have generally
    identified such statements by using words such as
    “anticipate,” “estimate,”
    “expect,” “project,” “intend,”
    “plan,” “believe,” “will,”
    “target,” “forecast” and similar expressions
    in connection with any discussion of future operating or
    financial performance. All statements that address activities,
    events or developments that we intend, expect or believe may
    occur in the future are forward-looking statements within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In
    particular, these include statements relating to future actions,
    future performance or results of current and anticipated sales,
    expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of
    contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be
    realized. Achievement of future results is subject to risks,
    uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should
    known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should
    underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could
    differ materially from past results and those anticipated,

    consider forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking

reports to the SEC. The risks that follow, individually or in
    the aggregate, are those that we think could cause our actual
    results to differ materially from those stated or implied in
    forward-looking statements. You should understand that it is not
    possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently,
    you should not consider the following to be a complete
    discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.

Our
    revenue growth could be adversely affected if we do not continue
    to expand our operations successfully.

We have steadily expanded the number of chains and stores we
    operate and our selling square footage. Our revenue growth is
    dependent upon our ability to continue to expand successfully
    through new store openings as well as our ability to increase
    same store sales. Successful store growth requires selection of
    store locations in appropriate geographies, availability of
    attractive stores or store sites in such locations and
    negotiation of acceptable terms. Competition for desirable sites
    and increases in real estate, construction and development costs
    could limit our growth opportunities.



Even if we succeed in opening new stores, these new stores may
    not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing
    stores. Further, expansion places demands upon us to manage
    rapid growth, and we may not do so successfully.

Our
    quarterly operating results can be subject to significant
    fluctuations and may fall short of either a prior quarter or
    investors’ expectations.

Our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in
    the past, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the
    future. Our earnings may not continue to grow at rates similar
    to the growth rates achieved in recent years and may fall short
    of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations. If we
    fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or
    investors, our share price may decline. Factors that could cause
    us not to meet analysts’ earnings expectations include some
    factors that are within our control, such as the execution of
    our off-price buying; selection, pricing and mix of merchandise;
    and inventory management including flow, markon and markdowns;
    and some factors that are not within our control, including
    actions of competitors, weather conditions, economic conditions
    and consumer confidence, and seasonality. In addition, if we do
    not repurchase the number of shares we contemplate pursuant to
    our stock repurchase programs, our earnings per share may be
    adversely affected. Most of our operating expenses, such as rent
    expense and associate salaries, do not vary directly with the
    amount of sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term.
    As a result, if sales in a particular quarter are below
    expectations for that quarter, we may not proportionately reduce
    operating expenses for that quarter, and therefore such a sales
    shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our net income
    for the quarter. We maintain a forecasting process that seeks to
    project sales and align expenses. If we do not correctly
    forecast sales or appropriately adjust to actual results, our
    financial performance could be adversely affected.

Our
    future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to
    expand within our existing markets and to extend our off-price
    model in new product lines, chains and geographic
    regions.

Our plans for the future require us to continue to expand
    rapidly within existing and new markets and geographies. Our
    growth strategy includes developing new ways to sell more
    merchandise within our existing stores, continued expansion of
    our existing chains in our existing markets and countries,
    expansion of these chains to new markets and countries, and
    development and opening of new concepts, all of which entail
    significant risk. Our growth is dependent upon our ability to
    successfully extend our off-price retail apparel and home
    fashions concepts in these ways. If we are unable to
    successfully do so, our future growth or financial performance
    could be adversely affected.

If we
    fail to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory
    management well, our business could be adversely
    affected.

We purchase the majority of our inventory opportunistically with
    our buyers purchasing close to need. To drive traffic to the
    stores and to increase same store sales, the treasure hunt
    nature of the off-price buying experience requires continued
    replenishment of fresh high quality, attractively priced
    merchandise in our stores. While opportunistic buying enables
    our buyers to buy at the right time and price, in the quantities
    we need and into market trends, it places considerable
    discretion in our buyers, subjecting us to risks on the timing,
    quantity and nature of inventory flowing to the stores. We rely
    on our expansive distribution infrastructure to support
    delivering goods to our stores on time. We must effectively and
    timely distribute inventory to stores, maintain an appropriate
    mix and level of inventory and effectively manage pricing and
    markdowns. We regularly change the allocation of floor space
    within our stores among product categories in response to
    demand. Failure to execute our opportunistic inventory buying
    and inventory management well could adversely affect our
    performance and our relationship with our customers.

If we do
    not implement our marketing, advertising and promotional
    programs successfully, or if our competitors are more effective
    than we are, our revenue may be adversely affected.

We use marketing and promotional programs as one of the ways we
    attract customers to our stores. We use various media for our
    promotional efforts, including print, television, database
    marketing and direct marketing. Some of our competitors may have
    substantially larger marketing budgets, which may provide them
    with a competitive advantage. There can be no assurance as to
    our continued ability to effectively execute our marketing and
    promotional programs, and any failure to do so could have a
    material effect on our revenue and results of operations.



Our
    actual losses arising from the Computer Intrusion could exceed
    our reserve for our estimated probable losses, and our
    reputation and business could be materially harmed as a result
    of any future data breach.

We suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions (such
    intrusion or intrusions, collectively, the Computer Intrusion)
    into portions of our computer system that process and store
    information related to customer transactions, which was
    discovered during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and in which
    we believe that customer data were stolen. Various litigation
    has been or may be filed, and various claims have been or may be
    otherwise asserted, against us

and/or

our
    acquiring banks for which we may be responsible relating to the
    Computer Intrusion. We have settled some litigation and claims
    and while we intend to defend the remaining litigation and
    claims vigorously, we cannot predict the outcome of such
    litigation and claims. Various governmental entities are
    investigating the actions of the Company with respect to the
    Computer Intrusion. Although a number of governmental
    investigations have been completed, we cannot predict what
    actions the governmental entities in the remaining
    investigations will take and what the consequences will be for
    us. We have recorded a reserve that reflects our estimation of
    probable losses arising from the Computer Intrusion in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. While
    this reserve represents our best estimation of total, potential
    cash liabilities from pending litigation, proceedings,
    investigations and other claims, as well as legal and other
    costs and expenses, arising from the Computer Intrusion, there
    is no assurance that our actual losses will not be greater.

Since discovering the Computer Intrusion, we have taken steps
    designed to strengthen the security of our computer systems and
    protocols and have instituted an ongoing program with respect to
    data security. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we
    will not suffer a future data compromise. We rely on
    commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring
    to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of
    confidential customer information, such as payment card and
    personal information. Further, the systems currently used for
    transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the
    technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which
    can put payment card data at risk, are determined and controlled
    by the payment card industry, not by us. Improper activities by
    third parties, advances in computer and software capabilities
    and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other
    events or developments may facilitate or result in a further
    compromise or breach of our computer systems. Any such further
    compromises or breaches could cause interruptions in our
    operations, damage to our reputation and customers’
    willingness to shop in our stores and subject us to additional
    costs and liabilities.

Our
    business is subject to seasonal influences and a decrease in
    sales or margins during the second half of the year could
    adversely affect our operating results.

Our business is subject to seasonal influences; we realize
    higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the
    year, which includes the back-to-school and year-end holiday
    season. Any decrease in sales or margins during this period
    could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our financial
    condition and results of operations.

If we
    fail to anticipate consumer trends and preferences, our
    performance could suffer.

Because our success depends on our ability to keep up with
    consumer trends, we take steps to address the risk that we will
    fail to anticipate consumer preferences. These include, for
    example, maintaining extensive contacts with vendors, with other
    retailers, as appropriate, and with the National Retail
    Federation, comparison shopping and monitoring fashion trends.
    Our buying departments and individual buyers monitor consumer
    trends and preferences in their respective product categories
    and areas. We focus on the demographics associated with the
    customer bases of our divisions and we monitor such demographics
    in locating new and remodeled stores. Opportunistic buying close
    to need helps us respond to consumer preferences and trends.
    Nonetheless, we still face the risk that we will fail to
    effectively anticipate consumer trends and preferences, which
    could adversely affect our results.

We
    experience risks associated with our substantial size and
    scale.

We operate eight store chains in several countries. Some aspects
    of the businesses and operations of the chains are conducted
    with relative autonomy. The large size of our operations, our
    multiple businesses and the autonomy afforded to the chains
    increase the risk that systems and practices will not be
    implemented uniformly throughout our Company and that
    information will not be appropriately shared across different
    chains and countries.

Unseasonable
    weather in the markets in which our stores operate could
    adversely affect our operating results.

Customers’ willingness to shop and their demand for the
    merchandise in our stores are affected by adverse and
    unseasonable weather. Frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or
    rain storms, severe cold or heat or extended periods of
    unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect
    our sales and increase markdowns. In addition, natural



disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a
    combination of these or other factors, could severely damage or
    destroy one or more of our stores or facilities located in the
    affected areas, thereby disrupting our business operations.

We
    operate in highly competitive markets, and we may not be able to
    compete effectively.

The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for
    customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and
    other important aspects of our business with many other local,
    regional and national retailers. In addition to other retail
    stores, we also face competition from other retail distribution
    channels such as catalogues, media and internet sites.
    Competition is characterized by many factors, including price,
    value, quality, brand names, merchandise assortment,
    advertising, marketing and promotional activities, service,
    location, reputation and credit availability. If we are not able
    to compete effectively with regard to these factors, our results
    of operations could be adversely affected.

If we do
    not attract and retain quality sales, distribution center and
    other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying
    and management personnel, our performance could be adversely
    affected.

Our performance is dependent on recruiting, developing, training
    and retaining quality sales, distribution center and other
    associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and
    management personnel. Many of our associates are in entry level
    or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover.
    The nature of the workforce in the retail industry subjects us
    to the risk of immigration law violations, which risk has
    increased in recent years. Our ability to meet our labor needs
    while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors
    such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage
    legislation, changing demographics, health and other insurance
    costs and state labor and employment requirements. In the event
    of increasing wage rates, if we do not increase our wages
    competitively, our customer service could suffer because of a
    declining quality of our workforce, or our earnings could
    decrease if we increase our wage rates. In addition, certain
    associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and
    therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions. Because of
    the distinctive nature of our off-price model, we must do
    significant internal training and development. The market for
    retail management is highly competitive and, in common with
    other retailers, we face challenges in securing sufficient
    management talent. Changes that adversely impact our ability to
    attract and retain quality associates and management personnel
    could adversely affect our performance.

If we
    engage in mergers or acquisitions of new businesses, or divest
    any of our current businesses, our business will be subject to
    additional risks.

We have grown our business in part through mergers and
    acquisitions. Integrating new stores and concepts can be a
    difficult task. We may consider opportunities to acquire new
    businesses or to divest any of our current business segments.
    Acquisition or divestiture activities may divert attention of
    our executive management team away from the existing businesses.
    We may do a less than optimal job of due diligence or evaluation
    of target companies. Divestiture also involves risks, such as
    the risk of future exposure on lease obligations. Failure to
    execute on mergers or divestitures in a satisfactory manner
    could have an adverse effect on our future business prospects or
    our financial performance in the future.

If we are
    unable to operate information systems and implement new
    technologies effectively, our business could be disrupted or our
    sales or profitability could be reduced.

The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our
    information systems, including our ability to operate them
    effectively and to successfully implement new technologies,
    systems, controls and adequate disaster recovery systems. In
    addition, we must protect the confidentiality of data of our
    Company, our associates, our customers and other third parties.
    The failure of our information systems to perform as designed or
    our failure to implement and operate them effectively could
    disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm
    our profitability.

We depend
    upon strong cash flows from our operations to support new
    capital expansion, operations, debt repayment and stock
    repurchase program.

Our business is dependent upon our operations generating strong
    cash flows to support our capital expansion requirements, our
    general operating activities and our stock repurchase programs
    and to fund debt repayment and the availability of financing
    sources. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash
    flows to support these activities or the lack of availability of
    financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms could
    adversely affect our financial performance or our earnings per
    share growth.



Consumer
    spending is adversely affected by general economic and other
    factors, which are beyond our control, and could adversely
    affect our sales and operating results.

Interest rates; recession; inflation; deflation; consumer credit
    availability; consumer debt levels; energy costs; tax rates and
    policy; unemployment trends; threats or possibilities of war,
    terrorism or other global or national unrest; actual or
    threatened epidemics; political or financial instability; and
    general economic, political and other factors beyond our control
    have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending.
    Consumer spending can, in turn, affect sales at retailers,
    including TJX. These factors beyond our control could adversely
    affect our sales and performance.

Issues
    with merchandise quality or safety could result in damage to our
    reputation, sales or financial results.

Merchandise we sell in our stores is subject to regulation of
    and regulatory standards set by various governmental authorities
    with respect to quality and safety. Regulations and standards in
    this area may change from time to time, and substantial
    additional regulations and standards have been proposed. Our
    inability to comply on a timely basis with regulatory
    requirements could result in significant fines or penalties,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    results. Issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we
    sell in our stores, regardless of our fault, or customer
    concerns about such issues, could result in damage to our
    reputation, lost sales, uninsured product liability claims or
    losses, merchandise recalls and increased costs, which could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

We are
    subject to import risks associated with importing merchandise
    from abroad.

Many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our
    vendors and to a limited extent by us in many foreign countries.
    Imported merchandise is subject to various risks, including
    potential disruptions in supply, changes in duties, tariffs,
    quotas and voluntary export restrictions on imported
    merchandise, strikes and other events affecting delivery;
    consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise,
    particularly merchandise imported from the People’s
    Republic of China; and economic, political or other problems in
    countries from or through which merchandise is imported.
    Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs,
    currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other
    factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise
    are beyond our control and could affect the availability and the
    price of our inventory.

Our
    expanding international operations expose us to risks inherent
    in foreign operations.

We have a significant presence in Canada, the United Kingdom and
    Ireland, and have recently expanded into Germany. We may also
    seek to expand into other international markets in the future.
    Our foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by
    our U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign
    operations, such as understanding the retail climate and trends,
    local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets,
    complying with foreign laws, rules and regulations, and foreign
    currency fluctuations, which could have an adverse impact on our
    profitability.

Litigation
    and changes in laws and regulations and accounting rules and
    principles could negatively affect our business operations and
    financial performance.

Various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state
    or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change
    from time to time. Generally accepted accounting principles may
    change from time to time, as well. In addition, we are regularly
    involved in various litigation matters that arise in the
    ordinary course of business. Litigation, regulatory developments
    and changes in accounting rules and principles could adversely
    affect our business operations and financial performance.

We own
    and lease for long periods significant amounts of real estate,
    which subjects us to various financial risks.

We lease virtually all of our store locations generally for long
    terms and either own or lease other real estate on which our
    primary distribution centers and administrative offices are
    located. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks
    associated with owning and leasing real estate. While we have
    the right to terminate some of our leases under specified
    conditions by making specified payments, we may not be able to
    cancel a particular lease. If an existing or future store is not
    profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to
    perform certain obligations under the applicable lease
    including, among other things, paying the rent for the balance
    of the lease term. When we assign or sublease leased property,
    we can remain liable if the sublessee does not perform. In
    addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to
    negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or
    at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable
    locations.



Our stock
    price may fluctuate based on market expectations.

The public trading of our stock is based in large part on market
    expectations that our business will continue to grow and that we
    will achieve certain levels of net income. If the securities
    analysts that regularly follow our stock lower their rating or
    lower their projections for future growth and financial
    performance, the market price of our stock is likely to drop. In
    addition, if our quarterly financial performance does not meet
    the expectations of securities analysts, our stock price would
    likely decline. The decrease in the stock price may be
    disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance.

Our
    results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price
    of oil.

Prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past. These
    fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation
    costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and
    costs to purchase our products from suppliers. A continued rise
    in oil prices could adversely affect consumer spending and
    demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both
    of which could have an adverse effect on our performance.

ITEM 3. LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

Computer Intrusion Related
    Litigation.

Putative class actions were filed
    against TJX and were consolidated in the District of
    Massachusetts,

In re TJX Companies Retail Security Breach
    Litigation

, 07-cv-10162, putatively on behalf of customers
    in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada whose transaction
    data were allegedly compromised by the Computer Intrusion and
    putatively on behalf of all financial institutions that received
    alerts from MasterCard or Visa related to the Computer Intrusion
    identifying payment cards issued by such financial institutions,
    and which thereafter suffered damages from actual reissuance
    costs, monitoring expenses or fraud loss. These putative class
    actions asserted claims for negligence and related common-law

and/or

statutory causes of action stemming from the Computer Intrusion,
    and sought various forms of relief including damages, related
    injunctive or equitable remedies, multiple or punitive damages,
    and attorneys’ fees.

On September 21, 2007, TJX entered into a settlement
    agreement with respect to the consolidated consumer class
    actions, amended November 14, 2007, which remains subject
    to various conditions and to final Court approval. A hearing on
    final approval has been scheduled for July 2008.

On October 12, 2007, the Court dismissed the
    plaintiffs’ claims in the consolidated financial
    institution class action other than claims of negligent
    misrepresentation and a state statutory claim based on the same
    claims of negligent misrepresentation. On November 29,
    2007, the Court denied the plaintiffs’ motions for class
    certification in the consolidated financial institution class
    action. Subsequently, the Court dismissed the action for lack of
    subject matter jurisdiction and ordered it transferred to
    Massachusetts state court. TJX obtained a stay of the transfer
    order from the United States Court of Appeals for the First
    Circuit and filed a notice of appeal of both the transfer order
    and certain other rulings. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal
    of the Court’s denial of their motions for class
    certification and other adverse rulings. The two appeals have
    been consolidated. TJX and the named plaintiffs other than
    AmeriFirstBank entered into a settlement of their claims in this
    litigation.

On November 29, 2007, TJX and its acquiring bank entered
    into a settlement agreement with Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa Inc.
    relating to the Computer Intrusion. Financial institutions
    representing more than 95% of eligible U.S. Visa accounts
    potentially affected by the Computer Intrusion accepted the
    settlement provided under this agreement. As part of the
    settlement, such issuers released TJX and its U.S. acquiring
    bank with regard to all claims, including the putative financial
    institutions class action, in connection with any injury or harm
    such issuers may have incurred as Visa issuers with respect to
    any of identified Visa accounts relating to the Computer
    Intrusion.

On January 16, 2008, AmeriFirstBank, one of the plaintiffs
    in the consolidated purported financial institution class
    action, and an additional plaintiff filed a new action in
    Massachusetts state court,

AmeriFirstBank et al. v. The
    TJX Companies, Inc. et al

, Massachusetts Superior Court

08-0229.

The
    new action raises allegations and claims nearly identical to
    those asserted in the purported federal financial institutions
    class action (and now on appeal). Plaintiffs indicated in their
    complaint that they intend to bring class allegations depending
    on pre-trial rulings by the state court. TJX removed the case



to federal court, the federal court remanded it back to state
    court, and TJX has sought leave to appeal the remand and a stay
    of the state court action.

The Arkansas Carpenters Pension Fund, the purported beneficial
    holder of 4,500 shares of TJX common stock, commenced an
    action in the Delaware Chancery Court under Section 220 of
    the Delaware General Corporation Law demanding to inspect
    certain of TJX’s books and records relating to the Computer
    Intrusion and TJX’s response to the Computer Intrusion. As
    relief, the plaintiff seeks the right to inspect records dating
    back to 2003, as well as its attorneys’ fees and costs.

Other Litigation.

Putative class actions have been
    filed against TJX and have been consolidated in the United
    States District Court for the District of Kansas,

In re: The
    TJX Companies, Inc. Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act
    (FACTA) Litigation

, MDL Docket No. 1853, putatively on
    behalf of persons in the United States to whom TJX provided
    credit card or debit card receipts in alleged violation of the
    Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, 15 U.S.C.
    § 1681 et seq. The plaintiffs in these actions seek
    statutory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, and
    costs and attorneys’ fees. Discovery as to class
    certification issues has commenced, and TJX has filed a motion
    to dismiss these actions.

A putative class action,

Mason Lee v. Marshalls of
    California, Inc.

(Case No. RG07337021), was filed in
    Alameda County, California, Superior Court on July 23, 2007
    for alleged violations of certain sections of the California
    Labor Code, principally Section 212 (prohibiting issuance
    of out-of-state paychecks), Section 226.7 (requiring paid
    rest periods) and Section 226 (requiring certain
    information on paychecks). The Complaint seeks unspecified
    actual damages, penalties of $100 for each aggrieved employee
    for the initial violation and $200 for each aggrieved employee
    for each subsequent violation, together with attorneys’
    fees and costs.

TJX intends to defend all pending litigation vigorously.

Government Investigations.

A multi-state group of
    39 state Attorneys General is investigating whether the
    Company may have violated their respective state consumer
    protection laws with respect to the Computer Intrusion. TJX has
    responded to Civil Investigative Demands with respect to this
    investigation.

The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether the
    Company may have violated federal law regarding consumer
    protection and related matters with respect to the Computer
    Intrusion.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The following discussion contains forward-looking information
    and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
    financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in
    this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the
    results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to
    various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A of
    this report under the section entitled “Risk Factors.”

The discussion that follows relates to our fiscal years ended
    January 26, 2008 (fiscal 2008), January 27, 2007
    (fiscal 2007) and January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2006).

In November 2006, we announced our decision to close 34 A.J.
    Wright stores as part of a repositioning of the chain. The
    following discussion reviews our results from continuing
    operations, which excludes the results of the closed A.J. Wright
    stores. The cost to close these stores was recorded as a
    discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and
    the operating income or loss from these stores is also presented
    as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. All
    references in the following discussion are to continuing
    operations unless otherwise indicated.

We suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions (such
    intrusion or intrusions collectively, the “Computer
    Intrusion”) into portions of our computer system, which was
    discovered during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and in which
    we believe customer data were stolen. See “Provision for
    Computer Intrusion related costs” below and Note B to
    the consolidated financial statements.

Results
    of Operations

FISCAL
    2008 OVERVIEW:

—

Net sales for fiscal 2008 were $18.6 billion, a 7% increase
    over fiscal 2007.

—

Consolidated same store sales increased 4% in fiscal 2008 over
    the prior year. Currency exchange rates favorably impacted same
    store sales growth contributing approximately two percentage
    points to the increase.

—

We increased both the number of our stores and our selling
    square footage by 4% in fiscal 2008. We ended the fiscal year
    with 2,563 stores in operation.

—

The fiscal 2008 results reflect pre-tax charges of
    $197.0 million with respect to the Computer Intrusion,
    including pre-tax costs of $37.8 million we expensed as
    incurred in the first six months and a $159.2 million
    charge for a pre-tax reserve for estimated losses thereafter.

—

Our pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales)
    declined from 7.2% in fiscal 2007 to 6.7% in fiscal 2008. The
    Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs, which reduced
    our pre-tax margin by 1.0% for fiscal 2008, more than offset
    what would otherwise have been an increase in our pre-tax margin.

—

Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was
    $771.8 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, compared to
    $776.8 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, last year.
    Fiscal 2008 income from continuing operations was reduced by
    $119 million, or $0.25 per share, for the after-tax impact
    of the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs. Fiscal
    2007 income from continuing operations was reduced by
    $3 million for such costs, which did not change the fiscal
    2007 earnings per share.

—

We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which
    allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our
    capital investment needs. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased
    33.3 million shares at a cost of $950 million, which
    favorably affected our earnings per share.

—

Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at
    our distribution centers, were up 2% at the end of fiscal 2008
    as compared to an increase of 7% for the prior year end.

The following is a summary of our operating results at the
    consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an overview
    of operating results by segment. All references to earnings per
    share are diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
    unless otherwise indicated. All prior periods have been adjusted
    to reclassify the operating results of the A.J. Wright store
    closings to discontinued operations. See also Note C to our
    consolidated financial statements.

Net sales:

Net sales for fiscal 2008 totaled
    $18.6 billion, a 7% increase over net sales of
    $17.4 billion in fiscal 2007. Net sales for fiscal 2007
    increased 9% over net sales of $16.0 billion for fiscal
    2006. The 7% increase in net sales for fiscal 2008 reflects a 3%
    increase from new stores and a 4% increase in same store sales.
    The 9% increase in net sales for fiscal 2007 reflects increases
    of 5% from new stores and 4% from same store sales.



New stores are a major source of sales growth. Our consolidated
    store count increased by 4% in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007
    over the respective prior year periods, and our selling square
    footage increased by 4% in fiscal 2008 and 5% in fiscal 2007. We
    expect to add 109 stores (net of store closings) in the fiscal
    year ending January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), a 4% increase
    in our consolidated store base. We also expect to increase our
    selling square footage base by 4%.

The 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2008 was driven
    by a strong performance at our international businesses as well
    as the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates,
    which contributed approximately two percentage points of growth.
    At our domestic divisions, sales of dresses, footwear and
    accessories were strong, partially offset by softer sales in the
    balance of the women’s apparel category. Home categories at
    Marmaxx, our largest division, were also weak. Same store sales
    also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear
    departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2008, we rolled out
    expanded footwear departments in approximately 240 Marshalls
    stores and plan to continue this expansion in approximately 200
    Marshalls stores in fiscal 2009, bringing the total to
    approximately 720. Same store sales for fiscal 2008 at our
    international businesses were above the consolidated average.
    Within the U. S., the strongest regions were the West coast and
    the Northeast, while Florida and the Southeast trailed the
    U.S. average. Overall transaction volume was slightly down,
    more than offset by an increase in the average ticket.

The 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2007 was driven
    by growth in unit sales and increased transactions as well as
    the strong performance at our international businesses
    (Winners’ same store sales increased 5% and T.K. Maxx same
    store sales increased 6%, both in local currency). Net sales for
    fiscal 2007 reflected growth in both apparel and home fashions.
    Within apparel, jewelry, accessories and footwear (combined), as
    well as misses sportswear and dresses performed well. As for
    home fashions, giftware and home decorative products performed
    well while our “soft” home categories (bedding,
    linens, etc.) did not perform to our expectations. Same store
    sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear
    departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2007, we added 134
    expanded footwear departments, bringing the total number of
    stores with the expanded footwear departments to 280. These
    stores had same store sales growth that exceeded the chain
    average. The expansion of jewelry and accessory departments at
    T.J. Maxx was substantially completed during fiscal 2007, with
    686 out of the total 821 stores having expanded departments at
    year end. In the U. S., same store sales increased across almost
    all regions, with the Northeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic
    areas experiencing the strongest growth. Same store sales growth
    was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, which
    contributed approximately one percentage point of growth.

We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have
    been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal
    years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third
    fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store
    until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which
    stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the
    beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains
    constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We
    calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and
    prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned.
    Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are
    generally classified in the same way as the original store, and
    we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated
    same store percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional
    same store sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also
    show divisional same store sales in local currency for our
    foreign divisions because this removes the effect of changes in
    currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate
    measure of the divisional operating performance.

    results as a percentage of net sales:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy
    costs:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy
    costs, as a percentage of net sales was 75.5% in fiscal 2008,
    75.9% in fiscal 2007 and 76.6% in fiscal 2006. This ratio for
    fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, reflected an
    improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin
    (0.5 percentage points), due to improved markon and lower
    markdowns. Throughout fiscal 2008, we solidly executed our
    off-price fundamentals, buying close to need and taking
    advantage of opportunities in the market place. This merchandise
    margin improvement was partially



offset by a slight increase in occupancy costs as a percentage
    of net sales. All other buying and occupancy costs remained
    relatively flat as compared to the same period last year.

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a
    percentage of net sales for fiscal 2007 as compared with fiscal
    2006 reflected an improvement in our consolidated merchandise
    margin (0.4 percentage points) as well as expense leverage
    due to our cost containment initiatives and the impact of strong
    same store sales growth. These improvements in the fiscal 2007
    expense ratio were partially offset by increases in some
    operating costs as a percentage of net sales, primarily
    occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points).

Selling, general and administrative expenses:

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
    net sales were 16.8% in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 and was
    16.9% in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2008 expense ratio remained
    consistent with the prior year with a planned increase in
    advertising costs (0.1 percentage point) and a fourth
    quarter impairment charge at our Bob’s Stores division
    (0.1 percentage point) being offset by our continuing cost
    containment initiatives. The decrease in fiscal 2007 compared to
    fiscal 2006 reflects expense leverage across most categories,
    partially offset by a planned increase in marketing expense
    (0.1 percentage point).

Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs:

We
    face potential liabilities and costs as a result of claims,
    litigation and investigations with respect to the Computer
    Intrusion. During the first six months of fiscal 2008, we
    expensed pre-tax costs of $37.8 million for costs we
    incurred related to the Computer Intrusion. In the second
    quarter of fiscal 2008, we were able to reasonably estimate our
    potential losses related to the Computer Intrusion and,
    accordingly, established a pre-tax reserve of
    $178.1 million and recorded a pre-tax charge in that
    amount. Subsequently, as previously disclosed, we settled the
    purported customer class actions (subject to final court
    approval), settled claims of Visa USA, Visa Inc. and
    substantially all U.S. Visa issuers and settled with most of the
    named plaintiffs in the purported financial institution class
    action. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we reduced our
    reserve and the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs
    by $18.9 million as a result of insurance proceeds with
    respect to the Computer Intrusion, which had not previously been
    reflected in the reserve, as well as a reduction in our
    estimated legal and other fees as we have continued to resolve
    outstanding disputes, litigation and investigations. As of
    January 26, 2008, our reserve balance was
    $117.3 million reflecting amounts paid for settlements
    (primarily the Visa settlement), legal and other fees. Our
    reserve reflects our current estimation of probable losses in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with
    respect to the Computer Intrusion and includes our current
    estimation of total potential cash liabilities, from pending
    litigation, proceedings, investigations and other claims, as
    well as legal and other costs and expenses, arising from the
    Computer Intrusion. In addition, we expect to record non-cash
    costs with respect to the customer class actions settlement, if
    finally approved, when incurred, which we do not expect to be
    material to our financial statements. As an estimate, our
    reserve is subject to uncertainty, and our actual costs may vary
    from our current estimate and such variations may be material.
    We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserve to adjust
    for developments in the course and resolution of litigation,
    claims and investigations and related expenses and for other
    changes in our estimates.

Interest (income) expense, net:

Interest (income)
    expense, net amounted to income of $1.6 million for fiscal
    2008, expense of $15.6 million for fiscal 2007 and expense
    of $29.6 million in fiscal 2006. These changes were the
    result of interest income totaling $40.7 million in the
    fiscal 2008 versus $23.6 million for fiscal 2007 and
    $9.4 million in fiscal 2006. The additional interest income
    in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007, as well as fiscal 2007 versus
    fiscal 2006, was due to higher cash balances available for
    investment, as well as higher interest rates earned on our
    investments.

Income taxes:

Our effective annual income tax rate
    was 37.9% in fiscal 2008, 37.7% in fiscal 2007 and 31.6% in
    fiscal 2006. The increase in the tax rate for fiscal 2008 as
    compared to fiscal 2007 reflects the absence of some fiscal 2007
    one-time benefits as well as an increase due to certain
    FIN 48 tax positions, partially offset by the favorable
    impact of increased income at our foreign operations and
    increased foreign tax credits. During fiscal 2008, we changed
    our assertion regarding the undistributed earnings of one of our
    Puerto Rican subsidiaries. Beginning in fiscal 2008’s third
    quarter, we concluded that the undistributed earnings of our
    Puerto Rican subsidiary that operates Marshalls stores would not
    be permanently reinvested. As a result, we recorded a deferred
    tax liability for the effect of the undistributed income and, in
    addition, we were able to fully recognize the benefit of
    accumulated foreign tax credits that had been earned at the
    subsidiary level. The net impact of this change in assertion was
    a reduction in our effective income tax rate of
    0.4 percentage points. Prior to this period, the earnings
    of this Puerto Rican subsidiary were deemed to be indefinitely
    reinvested.

The increase in the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate
    reflected the absence of one-time tax benefits recorded in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 (benefit for repatriation of
    earnings from our Canadian subsidiary and the correction of
    accounting for the tax impact of foreign currency gains on
    certain intercompany loans) which favorably impacted the fiscal
    2006 effective income tax rate by 6.8 percentage points.
    The fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate benefited through
    July 20,



2006 from the tax treatment of foreign currency gains and losses
    on certain intercompany loans between Winners and TJX. This tax
    treatment reduced the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate by
    0.2 percentage points. Effective July 20, 2006, we
    re-designated one of these intercompany loans and the related
    hedge as a net investment in our foreign operations, and gains
    and losses on these items after July 20, 2006 are recorded
    in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects. In addition,
    the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted
    by increased income at our foreign operations (a portion of
    which is taxed at a lower rate than our domestic operations) as
    well as settlement of a state tax assessment for less than the
    related reserves. Combined, these two items reduced the
    effective income tax rate by 0.6 percentage points as
    compared to fiscal 2006.

Income from continuing operations:

Income from
    continuing operations was $771.8 million in fiscal 2008,
    $776.8 million in fiscal 2007 and $689.8 million in
    fiscal 2006. Income from continuing operations per share was
    $1.66 in fiscal 2008, $1.63 in fiscal 2007 and $1.41 in fiscal
    2006. Unlike many companies in the retail industry, we did not
    have a

rd

week in fiscal 2007, but will have a

rd

week in fiscal 2009.

Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was adversely
    impacted by the charge relating to the Computer Intrusion of
    approximately $119 million, after tax, which reduced
    earnings per share by $0.25 per share. Income from continuing
    operations for fiscal 2007 was adversely impacted by the charge
    relating to the Computer Intrusion of approximately
    $3 million, after tax, which reduced fourth quarter
    earnings per share by $0.01 per share but did not change full
    year earnings per share.

Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was favorably
    impacted by a tax benefit of $47 million, or $0.10 per
    share, due to the repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a
    tax benefit of $22 million, or $0.04 per share, relating to
    the correction of a previously established deferred tax
    liability. In addition, income from continuing operations for
    fiscal 2006 was adversely impacted by approximately
    $12 million, or $0.02 per share, due to certain third
    quarter events. These third quarter events included the
    after-tax cost of executive resignation agreements, primarily
    with respect to our former CEO ($5 million),

e-commerce

exit costs and third quarter operating losses ($6 million),
    and uninsured losses due to third quarter hurricanes, including
    the estimated impact of lost sales ($6 million), all of
    which were partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard
    antitrust litigation settlement ($5 million).

Favorable changes in currency exchange rates added approximately
    $0.05 to our earnings per share in fiscal 2008 and approximately
    $0.03 to our earnings per share in fiscal 2007. In addition, the
    change in earnings per share in each fiscal year was favorably
    impacted by our share repurchase program. During fiscal 2008, we
    repurchased 33.3 million shares of our stock at a cost of
    $950 million. In fiscal 2007, we repurchased
    22.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of
    $557 million, which was less than planned, as we
    temporarily suspended our buyback activity in December 2006 as a
    result of the discovery and investigation of the Computer
    Intrusion. We plan to continue our share repurchase program in
    fiscal 2009 with planned purchases of approximately
    $900 million.

Discontinued operations and net income:

Our
    results from continuing operations exclude the results of
    operations and the cost of closing 34 A.J. Wright stores. See
    “Segment Information — A.J. Wright” below
    and Note C to the consolidated financial statements for
    more information. Net income, which includes the impact of
    discontinued operations, was $771.8 million, or $1.66 per
    share for fiscal 2008, $738.0 million, or $1.55 per share
    for fiscal 2007 and $690.4 million, or $1.41 per share for
    fiscal 2006.

Segment information:

The following is a discussion
    of the operating results of our business segments. We consider
    each of our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the
    performance of our segments based on “segment profit or
    loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before general
    corporate expense, Provision for Computer Intrusion related
    costs and interest. “Segment profit or loss” as we
    define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled
    measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of
    performance should not be considered an alternative to net
    income or cash flows from



operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a
    measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial
    information related to our business segments (U.S. dollars
    in millions):

Marmaxx, which operates the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store
    chains, posted a 1% same store sales increase in fiscal 2008
    compared to a 2% same store sales increase in fiscal 2007. Sales
    at Marmaxx for fiscal 2008 reflected strong same store sales
    increases in less weather-sensitive categories such as dresses,
    footwear and accessories. During fiscal 2008, we added expanded
    footwear departments to approximately 240 Marshalls stores and
    plan to add expanded departments to an additional 200 stores in
    fiscal 2009, taking the total to approximately 720. Home
    categories at Marmaxx underperformed in fiscal 2008 and we have
    taken measures to improve in this area of our execution.
    Geographically in fiscal 2008, same store sales for the
    Northeast, Southwest and West Coast were above the chain
    average, while same store sales in Florida and the Midwest were
    below the chain average.

Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (“segment
    margin” or “segment profit margin”) increased to
    9.7% in fiscal 2008 from 9.4% in fiscal 2007. Segment margin was
    favorably impacted by merchandise margins, which increased
    0.4 percentage points (as a percentage of net sales) due to
    lower markdowns and a higher markon, as well as some expense
    leverage due to our cost containment measures. These
    improvements in segment margin were partly offset by an increase
    in occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points) and a planned
    increase in advertising expense (0.1 percentage point). As
    of January 26, 2008, average inventories per store were
    down 2% compared to an 8% increase at the prior year end. The
    increase at the prior year end was primarily due to our in-stock
    position on spring transitional goods and an increase in average
    ticket.

Segment margin increased to 9.4% in fiscal 2007 from 9.0% in
    fiscal 2006. The increase was largely driven by a
    0.2 percentage point improvement in merchandise margin,
    primarily due to lower markdowns, and expense leverage across
    most categories due to our cost containment initiatives.
    Additionally, fiscal 2007 included the favorable impact on
    current year casualty insurance and employee medical costs of
    favorable claims experience. These improvements in segment
    margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs
    (0.2 percentage points) and a planned increase in marketing
    costs (0.1 percentage point).

We added a net of 54 new stores (T.J. Maxx or Marshalls) in
    fiscal 2008, and increased total selling square footage of the
    division by 3%. We expect to open approximately 45 new stores
    (net of closings) in fiscal 2009, increasing the Marmaxx store
    base by 3% and increasing its selling square footage by 2%.

Net sales for Winners and HomeSense, our Canadian businesses,
    for fiscal 2008 increased by 17% over fiscal 2007, with
    approximately one-half of this growth due to currency exchange
    rates. Same store sales (in local currency) increased by 5% in
    both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. Same store sales for fiscal
    2008 were positively impacted by sales of home fashions,
    footwear, jewelry and accessories. HomeSense continued to
    perform well, favorably impacting same store sales in fiscal
    2008 and fiscal 2007.

Segment profit margin for fiscal 2008 increased
    1.1 percentage points to 11.5% compared to 10.4% for fiscal
    2007. This improvement in segment margin was primarily due to
    improved expense ratios (leverage from the 5% same store sales
    increase as well as cost containment initiatives). Currency
    exchange rates increased segment profit by approximately
    $24 million for fiscal 2008. Most of this increase is due
    to currency translation, which also impacts sales growth and,
    therefore, has no impact on segment margin. The increase in
    segment profit due to currency exchange rates also included the
    favorable impact of the

mark-to-market

adjustment of inventory hedge contracts which increased segment
    margin by 0.3 percentage points. The inventory hedge
    contracts are designed to lock in the cost of merchandise
    purchases that are denominated in U.S. dollars. The fiscal
    2008 segment margin also reflected an increase in merchandise
    margin, primarily due to increased markon as well the favorable
    impact of cost containment initiatives and strong same store
    sales results on expense ratios.

Segment profit margin for fiscal 2007 increased
    2.1 percentage points to 10.4% compared to 8.3% for fiscal
    2006. This improvement in segment margin was primarily due to a
    1.4 percentage point increase in merchandise margins
    (improved markon and lower markdowns) combined with improved
    expense ratios (leverage from the 5% same store sales increase
    as well as cost containment initiatives). These increases were
    partially offset by a planned increase in advertising costs
    which increased 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of
    net sales.

We added a net of 7 Winners stores and 3 HomeSense stores in
    fiscal 2008, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by
    5%. We expect to add a net of 9 Winners and 4 HomeSense stores
    in fiscal 2009. Additionally, we plan to test a new off-price
    concept with 3 new stores in Canada in fiscal 2009, which will
    bring our total Canadian store base up by 5%, and increase
    selling square footage by 6%. The store counts include the
    Winners and HomeSense portions of this division’s
    superstores, which either combine a Winners store with a
    HomeSense store or operates them

side-by-side.

As of January 26, 2008 we operated 30 of these superstores.

Net sales for fiscal 2008 for T.K. Maxx, operating in the United
    Kingdom, Ireland and Germany, increased by 19% over fiscal 2007,
    with approximately 40% of this growth due to currency exchange
    rates. T.K. Maxx had a strong same store sales increase of 6%
    (in local currency) for fiscal 2008. Same store sales for home
    fashions, footwear, accessories and dresses performed above the
    chain average, while other apparel categories were generally
    below the chain average.

Segment profit for fiscal 2008 increased 16% to
    $127.2 million, while segment margin decreased slightly to
    5.7% compared to fiscal 2007. Currency exchange rates favorably
    impacted segment profit by approximately $10 million in
    fiscal 2008, but did not impact the segment profit margin.
    During fiscal 2008, T.K. Maxx opened its first 5 stores in
    Germany which reduced segment profit for fiscal 2008 by
    $11 million and reduced the fiscal 2008 segment margin by
    0.6 percentage points. The T.K. Maxx stores in the U.K. and
    Ireland increased segment margin for fiscal 2008 by
    0.4 percentage points, which reflected a slightly improved
    merchandise margin, as well as the favorable impact of same
    store sales growth on expense ratios and the division’s
    cost containment efforts.

Segment profit margin improved to 5.9% of sales for fiscal 2007
    compared to 4.6% for fiscal 2006. The 1.3 percentage point
    improvement was due to merchandise margin, which was up
    0.9 percentage points (primarily due to lower markdowns),
    as well as expense leverage from the 9% same store sales
    increase. These improvements were partially offset by an
    increase in occupancy expense due to higher costs for rent,
    utilities and property taxes and costs associated with store
    relocations.

We added a net of 16 T.K. Maxx stores, including 5 in Germany,
    in fiscal 2008 and increased the division’s selling square
    footage by 10%. In fiscal 2009, we plan to open a net of 15 T.K.
    Maxx stores, including another 5 in Germany and expect to
    introduce the HomeSense concept in Europe with a planned opening
    of 5 such stores. Overall we expect to expand selling square
    footage by 9%.

HomeGoods’ net sales for fiscal 2008 increased 8% compared
    to fiscal 2007, and same store sales increased 3% in fiscal
    2008. Segment margin of 5.1% for fiscal 2008 improved over
    fiscal 2007 primarily due to improved merchandise margins and
    the leveraging of expenses, particularly occupancy costs. These
    segment margin improvements were offset in part by an increase
    in advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. We
    attribute this division’s strong performance to solid
    execution of off-price buying and flow of product.

HomeGoods’ same store sales grew 4% in fiscal 2007 due to
    strong growth in giftware and home decorative products. Segment
    profit increased to $60.9 million from $28.4 million,
    and segment profit margin almost doubled to 4.5% of sales. The
    increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from
    leveraging expenses across most categories, most notably in
    distribution center and occupancy expenses.

We opened a net of 19 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2008, a 7%
    increase, and increased selling square footage of the division
    by 7%. In fiscal 2009, we plan to add a net of 25 HomeGoods
    stores and increase selling square footage by 9%.

Stores in operation and square
    footage for fiscal 2006 have been adjusted for store closings

A.J. Wright’s net sales increased 5% for fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007. A.J. Wright’s same store sales
    increased 2% for fiscal 2008, and segment loss for fiscal 2008
    was $1.8 million compared to $10.3 million for fiscal
    2007. This improvement was primarily due to stronger merchandise
    margin, a reduction in occupancy costs as a percentage of net
    sales and the impact of cost containment initiatives.

A.J. Wright’s same store sales increased 3% for fiscal
    2007, and segment loss for fiscal 2007 increased to
    $10.3 million. This decline, compared to fiscal 2006, was
    primarily the result of a decrease in merchandise margin
    (1.2 percentage points) due to markdowns on below-plan
    sales. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, as part of a
    plan to reposition this business, we identified 34
    underperforming A.J. Wright stores for closing, virtually all of
    which were closed by fiscal 2007 year end. The cost to
    close these stores and their historical operating results are
    presented as discontinued operations. By closing these
    marginally profitable stores, we reduced the number of
    advertising markets in which A.J. Wright operates enabling
    better marketing leverage as well as enabling greater
    efficiencies in store operations and logistics. The store
    closings also allowed management to focus their attention and
    resources on the remaining, better performing stores.

We currently plan to add a net of 5 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal
    2009. We continue to believe that A.J. Wright can be a growth
    vehicle for TJX, with its very sizable target customer
    demographic.

Bob’s Stores’ net sales increased 3% for fiscal 2008,
    and same store sales increased 5%, with footwear performing
    well. Bob’s Stores segment loss for fiscal 2008 was flat
    compared to the prior year. Merchandise margin increases were
    driven by improved markon, the result of better buying, which
    more than offset increases in promotional markdowns as we
    significantly increased the level of promotions in this
    division. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we
    recorded an impairment charge of approximately $8 million.
    The impairment charge related to certain long lived assets and
    intangible assets at Bob’s Stores and represented the
    excess of recorded carrying values over the estimated fair value
    of these assets.

For fiscal 2009, we do not plan to open any new stores for this
    division as we continue to evaluate this business.

GENERAL
    CORPORATE EXPENSE:

Fiscal Year Ended January

Dollars in millions




General corporate expense

$

139.4

$

136.4

$

134.1

General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are
    those costs not specifically related to the operations of our
    business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate
    office, including the compensation and benefits (including stock
    based compensation) for senior corporate management; payroll and
    operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and
    budgeting, internal audit, compliance, treasury, investor
    relations, tax, risk management, legal, human resources and
    systems; and the occupancy and office maintenance costs
    associated with the corporate staff. In addition, general
    corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing
    retirees and non-operating costs and other gains and losses not
    attributable to individual divisions. General corporate expense
    is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in
    the consolidated statements of income.

The comparison of general corporate expense in fiscal 2008
    versus fiscal 2007 reflected an increase in corporate support
    costs in fiscal 2008 and a $5 million charge in fiscal 2007
    relating to the cost of a workforce reduction and other
    termination benefits at the corporate level.

In comparing general corporate expense for fiscal 2007 to fiscal
    2006, fiscal 2007 included the $5 million charge referred
    to above, while fiscal 2006 included costs of $9 million
    associated with executive resignation agreements and
    $6 million of



costs to exit the

e-commerce

business. The increase in other general corporate expenses in
    fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 also reflected increases in
    corporate payroll, corporate marketing and consulting costs,
    charitable contributions, and European expansion costs.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Operating activities:

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $1,361.1 million in fiscal 2008, $1,195.0 million in
    fiscal 2007 and $1,158.0 million in fiscal 2006. The cash
    generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal
    years was largely due to operating earnings.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 increased by
    $166.1 million. Net income (adjusted for depreciation and
    amortization) for fiscal 2008 increased $50.0 million. The
    change in inventory, net of accounts payable, from prior
    year-end levels was a significant component of operating cash
    flows. In fiscal 2008, the change in merchandise inventory, net
    of the related change in accounts payable, favorably impacted
    operating cash flows by $4.9 million compared to a use of
    cash of $151.2 million in fiscal 2007. Additionally, fiscal
    2008 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by the change
    in income taxes payable. These increases in fiscal 2008
    operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2007 were offset by
    the unfavorable cash flow impact of the deferred income tax
    provision, changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities and
    changes in accounts receivable.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2007 increased by
    $37.0 million compared to fiscal 2006, driven by an
    increase in net income (adjusted for depreciation and
    amortization) of $86.4 million. In fiscal 2007, the change
    in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts
    payable, resulted in a use of cash of $151.2 million
    compared to a source of cash of $26.2 million in fiscal
    2006. Fiscal 2007 operating cash flows were also reduced by
    higher income tax payments. These reductions in fiscal 2007
    operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2006 were offset by
    the favorable cash flow impact of changes in deferred income
    taxes, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses.

The variance in operating cash flows attributable to the change
    in the net inventory position over the last three fiscal years
    is largely explained by our average per store inventory levels
    at each year end period. Average per store inventories at
    January 26, 2008, including inventory on hand at our
    distribution centers, increased 2% compared to an increase of 7%
    at January 27, 2007. This compares to inventories per store
    at January 28, 2006 that were down 11% compared to the
    prior year.

Discontinued operations reserve:

We have a reserve
    for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates
    primarily to real estate leases associated with 34 of our A.J.
    Wright stores (see Note C to the consolidated financial
    statements) as well as leases of former TJX businesses. The
    balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three
    fiscal years is presented below:

The exit costs related to 34 of our A.J. Wright stores resulted
    in an addition to the reserve of $62 million in fiscal
    2007. The other additions to the reserve for lease related
    obligations in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 are the result of
    periodic adjustments to our estimated lease obligations of our
    former businesses and are offset by income from creditor
    recoveries of a similar amount. The lease related charges
    against the reserve during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 relate
    primarily to our former businesses. The fixed asset write-offs
    and other charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 and all
    the charges against the reserve in fiscal 2008 relate primarily
    to the 34 A.J. Wright closed stores, virtually all of which were
    closed at the end of fiscal 2007.



Approximately $32 million of the fiscal 2008 reserve
    balance and $43 million of the fiscal 2007 reserve balance
    relates to the A.J. Wright store closings, primarily our
    estimation of lease costs, net of estimated subtenant income.
    The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost
    of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we believe are
    likely to be, made against us for liability as an original
    lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses, after
    mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. At
    January 26, 2008, substantially all the leases of former
    businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the
    landlords asserted liability against us had been resolved. The
    actual net cost of A.J. Wright lease obligations may differ from
    our original estimate. Although our actual costs with respect to
    the lease obligations of former businesses may exceed amounts
    estimated in our reserve, and we may incur costs for leases from
    these former businesses that were not terminated or had not
    expired, we do not expect to incur any material costs related to
    these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts
    estimated. We estimate that the majority of the discontinued
    operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years.
    The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how
    the remaining lease obligations are actually settled.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of
    BJ’s Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, for which
    BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for
    discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because
    we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to us
    with respect to these leases is remote due to the current
    financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club.

Off-balance sheet liabilities:

We have contingent
    obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor,
    which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released
    by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous
    leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant
    number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our
    former businesses discussed above, we have rarely had a claim
    with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not
    expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We
    do not generally have sufficient information about these leases
    to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them,
    which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the
    current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related to
    one or more of these leases.

We also have contingent obligations in connection with some
    assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We
    estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our
    reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations,
    BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed above, and properties
    of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the
    subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, to be
    approximately $105 million as of January 26, 2008. We
    believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will
    not revert to us and, to the extent they do, will be resolved
    for substantially less due to mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which we may be
    obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of
    warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
    sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
    These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
    There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
    respect to these contingent obligations.

Investing activities

    expenditures for the last three years as set forth in the table

We expect that capital expenditures will approximate

    $140 million for new stores, $288 million for store
    renovations, expansions and improvements and $147 million
    for our office and distribution centers. The planned increase in
    capital expenditures is attributable to increased spending on
    renovations and improvements to existing stores, particularly
    T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and T.K. Maxx.

Financing activities

:

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash
    outflows of $952.7 million in fiscal 2008,
    $418.0 million in fiscal 2007 and $503.7 million in
    fiscal 2006. The majority of this outflow relates to our share
    repurchase program.



We spent $950.2 million in fiscal 2008, $557.2 million
    in fiscal 2007 and $600.0 million in fiscal 2006 under our
    stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 33.3 million
    shares in fiscal 2008, 22.0 million shares in fiscal 2007
    and 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2006. All shares
    repurchased were retired. Repurchases were suspended late in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and for most of the first quarter
    of fiscal 2008 as a result of the discovery of the Computer
    Intrusion. We record the repurchase of our stock on a cash basis
    and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary
    from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our
    repurchases. Of the $950.2 million of repurchases made
    during fiscal 2008, $436.2 million completed a
    $1 billion stock repurchase program initially authorized in
    October 2005 and $514.0 million were made under the
    $1 billion stock repurchase program authorized in January
    2007. In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an
    additional multi-year stock repurchase plan of $1 billion.

In January 2006, we entered into a C$235 million term
    credit facility (through our Canadian division, Winners) due in
    January 2010. This debt is guaranteed by TJX. Interest is
    payable on borrowings under this facility at rates equal to or
    less than Canadian prime rate. Winners entered into an interest
    rate swap agreement which effectively established a fixed
    interest rate of approximately 4.5% on this debt. The proceeds
    were used to fund the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian
    division as well as other general corporate purposes of this
    division. Financing activities also included scheduled principal
    payments on long-term debt of $100 million in fiscal 2006.
    For fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, there were no scheduled
    principal payments on long-term debt.

We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which
    totaled $0.36 per share in fiscal 2008, $0.28 per share in
    fiscal 2007 and $0.24 per share in fiscal 2006. Cash payments
    for dividends on our common stock totaled $151.5 million in
    fiscal 2008, $122.9 million in fiscal 2007 and
    $105.3 million in fiscal 2006. Financing activities also
    included proceeds of $134.1 million in fiscal 2008,
    $260.2 million in fiscal 2007 and $102.4 million in
    fiscal 2006 from the exercise of employee stock options.

We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise
    requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term
    bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper.
    In fiscal 2007, we amended our $500 million, four-year
    revolving credit facility and our $500 million, five-year
    revolving credit facility (initially entered into in fiscal
    2006), to extend the maturity dates of these agreements until
    May 2010 and May 2011, respectively. These agreements have no
    compensating balance requirements and have various covenants
    including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to
    earnings. We also have a commercial paper program pursuant to
    which we issue commercial paper from time to time. The revolving
    credit facilities are used as back up to our commercial paper
    program. As of January 26, 2008, there were no outstanding
    amounts under our credit facilities. There were no borrowings on
    our credit facilities during fiscal 2008. The maximum amount of
    our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was
    $205 million during fiscal 2007 and $567 million
    during fiscal 2006. The weighted average interest rate on our
    U.S. short-term borrowings was 5.35% in fiscal 2007 and
    3.69% in fiscal 2006.

As of January 26, 2008 and January 27, 2007, Winners
    had two credit lines, one for C$10 million for operating
    expenses and one C$10 million letter of credit facility.
    The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line
    for operating expenses was C$5.7 million in fiscal 2008,
    C$3.8 million in fiscal 2007 and C$4.6 million in
    fiscal 2006, and there were no amounts outstanding on either of
    these lines at the end of fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007. As of
    January 26, 2008, T.K. Maxx had credit lines totaling
    £20 million. The maximum amount outstanding in fiscal
    2008 was £16.4 million, and there were no outstanding
    borrowings at January 26, 2008 or January 27, 2007.

We believe that internally generated funds and our current
    credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating
    needs for at least the next twelve months. See Note D to
    the consolidated financial statements for further information
    regarding our long-term debt and available financing sources.

Contractual obligations:

As of January 26,
    2008, we had payment obligations (including current
    installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases for
    property and equipment and purchase obligations that will
    require cash outflows as follows (in thousands):

The long-term debt obligations above include estimated interest
    costs and assume that all holders of the zero coupon convertible
    subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2014. If
    none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not
    redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The
    effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based
    on their values as of January 26, 2008.

The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent
    and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes and
    common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay.
    These costs were approximately one-third of the total minimum
    rent for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2008.

Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders
    for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures,
    supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts
    for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under
    executive employment and other agreements. We excluded long-term
    agreements for services and operating needs that can be
    cancelled without penalty.

We also have long-term liabilities which include
    $125.4 million for employee compensation and benefits, most
    of which will come due beyond five years, derivative contracts
    of approximately $143.1 million, the majority of which come
    due in fiscal 2010, $150.5 million for accrued rent, the
    cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease
    commitments in the above table and $269.2 million for
    uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible
    to predict when it may be paid.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We
    consider our most critical accounting policies, involving
    management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the
    areas described below. We believe that we have selected the most
    appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that
    the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions
    been selected, would not be materially different from the
    results we have reported.

Inventory valuation:

We use the retail method for
    valuing inventory on a

first-in

first-out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of
    inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a

cost-to-retail

ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This
    method is widely used in the retail industry and involves
    management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and
    inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording
    and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method,
    permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation
    when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail
    method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than
    other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business
    practice, we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to
    be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates.
    Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for
    interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory near
    the fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and
    estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results,
    but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe
    that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent
    markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each
    fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is
    fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with
    vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain
    conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory.
    Our off-price businesses have historically not entered into such
    arrangements with our vendors. Bob’s Stores, the
    value-oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have
    vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising
    dollars if certain conditions are met. These arrangements may
    have some impact on Bob’s Stores’ inventory valuation
    but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results.

Impairment of long-lived assets:

We review the
    recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets at
    least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that
    would indicate that their carrying amounts are not recoverable.
    Significant judgments are involved in projecting the cash flows
    of individual stores and our business units and involve a number
    of factors including historical trends, recent performance and
    general economic assumptions. If it is determined that an
    impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an
    impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of
    the assets over the estimated fair value of the assets.

Retirement obligations:

Retirement costs are
    accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in
    the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in
    the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are
    required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the
    discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term
    rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of
    which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The
    discount rate, which we determine annually based on market
    interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return,
    which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two
    factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost
    of



retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified
    pension plan. We have made contributions of $65 million,
    which exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years
    to largely restore the funded status of our plan.

Casualty insurance:

In July 2007 we entered into a
    fixed premium program for our casualty insurance. Our casualty
    insurance program prior to 2007 requires us to estimate the
    total claims we will incur as a component of our annual
    insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the
    assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and
    other factors. These estimates involve significant judgements
    and assumptions and actual results could differ from these
    estimates. If our estimate for the claims component of our
    casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2008 were to change by
    10%, the fiscal 2008 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by
    approximately $2 million. A large portion of these claims
    are funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year,
    offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of
    $26.4 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty
    insurance program as of January 26, 2008.

Accounting for taxes:

Like many large
    corporations, we are regularly under audit by United States
    federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of
    income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In
    evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various
    tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures.
    Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we
    have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for
    possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters
    for which accruals have been established or be required to pay
    amounts in excess of reserves, our effective income tax rate in
    a given financial period might be materially impacted. The
    Internal Revenue Service has examined the fiscal years ended
    January 2000 through January 2003 and several refund claims have
    been approved by IRS Appeals Office and are awaiting
    confirmation by the Congressional Joint Tax Committee. We also
    have various state and foreign tax examinations in process.

Reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for
    discontinued operations:

As discussed in Note B and
    Note L to the consolidated financial statements and
    elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis, we
    have reserves established for probable losses arising out of the
    Computer Intrusion and for leases relating to operations
    discontinued by us where we were the original lessee or a
    guarantor and which have been assigned or sublet to third
    parties. The Computer Intrusion reserve requires us to make
    numerous estimates and assumptions about the outcome and costs
    of claims, litigation and investigations and the related costs
    and expenses we will incur. We make these estimates based on our
    best judgments of the outcome of such claims, litigation and
    investigation and related costs and expenses. The leases
    relating to discontinued operations are long-term obligations
    and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and
    assumptions including whether and for how long we remain
    obligated with respect to a particular lease, the extent to
    which an assignee or subtenant will assume our obligation under
    the leases, amounts of subtenant income, how a particular
    obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating
    factors, including indemnification, may exist with regard to any
    liability. We develop these assumptions based on past experience
    and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the
    circumstances surrounding each situation and location. We
    believe that our current reserves are a reasonable estimate of
    the most likely outcomes and that the reserves should be
    adequate to cover the ultimate cash costs we will incur.
    However, actual results may differ from our current estimates,
    and such differences could be material. We may decrease or
    increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for developments
    relating to the underlying assumptions.

Loss Contingencies:

Certain conditions may exist
    as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may
    result in a loss to us but which will not be resolved until one
    or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management,
    where relevant, with the assistance of our legal counsel,
    assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment
    inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss
    contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending
    against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our
    legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of
    any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits
    of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein.

If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable
    that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the
    liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would
    be accrued in the financial statements. If the assessment
    indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not
    probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot
    be estimated, then we will disclose the nature of the contingent
    liability, together with an estimate of the range of the
    possible loss or a statement that such loss is not estimable.

RECENT
    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157).
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced
    disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose fair value
    measurements according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in
    the standard. Additionally, companies are required to provide
    enhanced disclosure regarding fair value measurements in one of
    the categories (level 3), including a reconciliation of the
    beginning and ending balances separately for each major category



of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 is effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years, and will be applied prospectively. SFAS No. 157
    is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal
    2009. In February 2008, the FASB issued a Staff Position that
    will (1) partially defer the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities and (2) remove certain
    leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157.
    We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have
    a material impact on our results of operations or financial
    condition.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115,” (SFAS No. 159).
    SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to
    report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value
    and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements
    designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose
    different fair value measurement attributes for similar types of
    assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
    periods within those years and will be effective for the Company
    in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not believe that
    SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on our
    financial statements.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading
    purposes.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our
    investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European
    (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A
    and E to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a
    significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations;
    intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain
    merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations;
    with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative
    contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We
    utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset
    the gains or losses in the underlying exposures; most of these
    gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders’
    equity. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are
    creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major
    industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis
    assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency
    exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the
    underlying exposures described above. As of January 26,
    2008, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would
    not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain
    lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in
    interest rates affect interest earned and paid by TJX. In
    addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and
    future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest
    expense. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to
    manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use
    of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market
    conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a
    hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to
    the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during fiscal 2008.
    As of January 26, 2008, the analysis indicated that such an
    adverse movement would not have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Market
    Risk

The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of
    which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks
    and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the
    pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control
    our exposure to these market uncertainties. Investments, in
    general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate,
    credit, and overall market volatility. As such it is reasonably
    possible that changes in the values of investments will occur in
    the near term and such changes could affect the amounts reported.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of our management, including our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by
    this report pursuant to

Rules 13a-15

and

15d-15

of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring
    that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
    that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
    (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
    the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms;
    and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and
    procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
    provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
    and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating
    the cost-benefit relationship of implementing possible controls
    and procedures.

(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008
    identified in connection with our Chief Executive Officer’s
    and Chief Financial Officer’s evaluation that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(c) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting

The management of TJX is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
    Internal control over financial reporting is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
    TJX’s principal executive and principal financial officers,
    or persons performing similar functions, and effected by
    TJX’s board of directors, management and other personnel,
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures
    that:

—

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of TJX;

—

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of TJX are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    TJX; and

—

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
    TJX’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable
    assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the
    preparation and fair presentation of published financial
    statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
    control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
    effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
    financial statement preparation and presentation. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of TJX’s
    management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, TJX conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 26, 2008 based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (“COSO”). Based on that evaluation,
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of January 26, 2008.

(d) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public
    Accounting Firm

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited and reported on our consolidated
    financial statements contained herein, has audited the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 26, 2008, and has issued an attestation
    report on the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting included herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To The Board of Directors and Shareholders

of The TJX Companies, Inc:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of The TJX Companies, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries at January 26, 2008 and January 27, 2007,
    and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended January 26,
    2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
    the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying
    index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
    set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
    consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2008,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report
    on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note J to the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement
    obligations as of January 27, 2007. In addition, as
    discussed in Note I to the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for uncertain tax positions as of January 28,
    2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The TJX
    Companies, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

A.

Summary
    of Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated financial
    statements of The TJX Companies, Inc. (referred to as
    “TJX”, the “Company” or “we”)
    include the financial statements of all of TJX’s
    subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All of TJX’s
    activities are conducted within TJX or our subsidiaries and are
    consolidated in these financial statements. All intercompany
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Year:

TJX’s fiscal year ends on the
    last Saturday in January. The fiscal years ended
    January 26, 2008 (“fiscal 2008”),
    January 27, 2007 (“fiscal 2007”) and
    January 28, 2006 (“fiscal 2006”) each included
    52 weeks.

Earnings Per Share:

All earnings per share amounts
    discussed refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise
    indicated.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of the financial
    statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States, requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent
    liabilities, at the date of the financial statements as well as
    the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. TJX considers the more significant accounting
    policies that involve management estimates and judgments to be
    those relating to inventory valuation, impairments of long-lived
    assets, retirement obligations, casualty insurance, accounting
    for taxes, reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for
    discontinued operations, and loss contingencies. Actual amounts
    could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be
    material.

Revenue Recognition:

TJX records revenue at the
    time of sale and receipt of merchandise by the customer, net of
    a reserve for estimated returns. We estimate returns based upon
    our historical experience. We defer recognition of a layaway
    sale and its related profit to the accounting period when the
    customer receives the layaway merchandise. Proceeds from the
    sale of store cards as well as the value of store cards issued
    to customers as a result of a return or exchange, are deferred
    until the customer uses the card to acquire merchandise. Based
    on historical experience, we estimate the amount of store cards
    that will not be redeemed (“breakage”) and, to the
    extent allowed by local law, these amounts are amortized into
    income over the redemption period. Revenue recognized from store
    card breakage was $10.1 million, $7.6 million and
    $6.9 million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Consolidated Statements of Income Classifications:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, include the
    cost of merchandise sold and gains and losses on
    inventory-related derivative contracts; store occupancy costs
    (including real estate taxes, utility and maintenance costs and
    fixed asset depreciation); the costs of operating our
    distribution centers; payroll, benefits and travel costs
    directly associated with buying inventory; and systems costs
    related to the buying and tracking of inventory.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include store
    payroll and benefit costs; communication costs; credit and check
    expenses; advertising; administrative and field management
    payroll, benefits and travel costs; corporate administrative
    costs and depreciation; gains and losses on non-inventory
    related foreign currency exchange contracts; and other
    miscellaneous income and expense items.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

TJX generally considers
    highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
    less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Our
    investments are primarily high-grade commercial paper,
    institutional money market funds and time deposits with major
    banks. The fair value of cash equivalents approximates carrying
    value.

Merchandise Inventories:

Inventories are stated at
    the lower of cost or market. TJX uses the retail method for
    valuing inventories on the

first-in

first-out basis. We almost exclusively utilize a permanent
    markdown strategy and lower the cost value of the inventory that
    is subject to markdown at the time the retail prices are lowered
    in our stores. We accrue for inventory obligations at the time
    inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by
    TJX. At January 26, 2008 and January 27, 2007,
    in-transit inventory included in merchandise inventories was
    $362.9 million and $346.2 million, respectively.
    Comparable amounts were reflected in accounts payable at those
    dates.

Common Stock and Equity:

Equity transactions
    consist primarily of the repurchase of our common stock under
    our stock repurchase programs and the amortization of expense
    and issuance of common stock under our stock incentive plan.
    Under our stock repurchase programs we repurchase our common
    stock on the open market. The par value of the shares
    repurchased is charged to common stock with the excess of the
    purchase price over par first charged against any available

F-7


additional paid- in capital (“APIC”) and the balance
    charged to retained earnings. Due to the high volume of
    repurchases over the past several years, we have no remaining
    balance in APIC. All shares repurchased have been retired.

Shares issued under our stock incentive plan are issued from
    authorized but unissued shares, and proceeds received are
    recorded by increasing common stock for the par value of the
    shares with the excess over par added to APIC. Income tax
    benefits upon the expensing of options result in the creation of
    a deferred tax asset, while income tax benefits due to the
    exercise of stock options reduce deferred tax assets to the
    extent that an asset for the related grant has been created. Any
    tax benefit greater than the deferred tax asset created at the
    time of expensing the option is credited to APIC; any deficiency
    in the tax benefit is debited to APIC to the extent a
    ‘pool’ for such deficiency exists. In the absence of a
    pool any deficiency is realized in the related periods’
    statements of income through the provision for income taxes. The
    excess income tax benefits, if any, are included in cash flows
    from financing activities in the statements of cash flows. The
    par value of restricted stock awards is also added to common
    stock when the stock is issued, generally at grant date. The
    fair value of the restricted stock awards in excess of par value
    is added to APIC as the award is amortized into earnings over
    the related vesting period.

Stock-Based Compensation:

TJX adopted the
    provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004)

“Share-Based
    Payment”

(SFAS No. 123(R)) in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006. TJX elected the modified retrospective
    transition method and accordingly all periods presented reflect
    the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). For purposes
    of applying the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), the
    fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. See
    Note G for a detailed discussion of stock-based
    compensation.

Interest:

TJX’s interest (income) expense,
    net was income of $1.6 million in fiscal 2008, and expense
    of $15.6 million and $29.6 million in fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Interest (income) expense is presented as a
    net amount. TJX had gross interest income of $40.7 million,
    $23.6 million and $9.4 million in fiscal 2008, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. We capitalize interest during the active
    construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized
    interest is added to the cost of the related assets. TJX
    capitalized interest of $799,000 in fiscal 2008. No interest was
    capitalized in fiscal 2007 or 2006. Debt discount and related
    issue expenses are amortized to interest expense over the lives
    of the related debt issues or to the first date the holders of
    the debt may require TJX to repurchase such debt.

Depreciation and Amortization:

For financial
    reporting purposes, TJX provides for depreciation and
    amortization of property by the use of the straight-line method
    over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are
    depreciated over 33 years. Leasehold costs and improvements
    are generally amortized over their useful life or the committed
    lease term (typically 10 years), whichever is shorter.
    Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over 3 to
    10 years. Depreciation and amortization expense for
    property was $364.2 million for fiscal 2008,
    $347.0 million for fiscal 2007 and $307.7 million for
    fiscal 2006. Amortization expense for property held under a
    capital lease was $2.2 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and
    2006. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
    incurred. Significant costs incurred for internally developed
    software are capitalized and amortized over 3 to 10 years.
    Upon retirement or sale, the cost of disposed assets and the
    related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any gain or
    loss is included in net income. Pre-opening costs, including
    rent, are expensed as incurred.

Lease Accounting:

TJX records rent expense when it
    takes possession of a store, which occurs before the
    commencement of the lease term, as specified in the lease, and
    generally 30 to 60 days prior to the opening of the store.
    This results in an acceleration of the commencement of rent
    expense for each lease, as we record rent expense during the
    pre-opening period, but a reduction in monthly rent expense, as
    the total rent due under the lease is amortized over a greater
    number of months.

Goodwill and Tradename:

Goodwill is primarily the
    excess of the purchase price paid over the carrying value of the
    minority interest acquired in fiscal 1990 in TJX’s former
    83%-owned subsidiary and represents goodwill associated with the
    T.J. Maxx chain, which is included in the Marmaxx segment in all
    periods presented. In addition, goodwill includes the excess of
    cost over the estimated fair market value of the net assets of
    Winners acquired by TJX in fiscal 1991.

Goodwill, net of amortization, totaled $72.2 million,
    $71.9 million and $72.0 million as of January 26,
    2008, January 27, 2007 and January 28, 2006,
    respectively. Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life
    and accordingly is no longer amortized. Cumulative amortization
    was $33.2 million as of January 26, 2008,
    $33.0 million as of January 27, 2007 and
    $33.1 million as of January 28, 2006. Changes in
    goodwill cost and accumulated amortization are attributable to
    the effect of exchange rate changes on Winners’ reported
    goodwill.

Tradenames include the values assigned to the name
    “Marshalls,” acquired by TJX in fiscal 1996 as part of
    the acquisition of the Marshalls chain, and to the name
    “Bob’s Stores” acquired in fiscal 2004 as part of
    the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Bob’s
    Stores. These values were determined by the discounted present
    value of assumed after-tax royalty payments, offset by a
    reduction for their pro-rata share of negative goodwill.

F-8


The Marshalls tradename, net of accumulated amortization, is
    carried at a value of $107.7 million, and is considered to
    have an indefinite life and, accordingly, is no longer
    amortized. The Bob’s Stores tradename, pursuant to the
    purchase accounting method, was valued at $4.8 million and
    is being amortized over 10 years. An impairment charge of
    $1.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2008 (included in the impairment of long-lived assets charge
    discussed below) reducing the carrying value of the tradename to
    $3.6 million. Amortization expense of $476,000, $477,000
    and $477,000 was recognized in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Cumulative amortization as of January 26,
    2008, January 27, 2007 and January 28, 2006 was
    $1.9 million, $1.5 million and $993,000, respectively.

TJX occasionally acquires other trademarks in connection with
    private label merchandise. Such trademarks are included in other
    assets and are amortized to cost of sales, including buying and
    occupancy costs, over the term of the agreement, generally from
    7 to 10 years. Amortization expense related to trademarks
    was $351,000, $499,000 and $492,000 in fiscal 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. TJX had $1.4 million, $1.7 million
    and $2.2 million in trademarks, net of accumulated
    amortization, at January 26, 2008, January 27, 2007
    and January 28, 2006, respectively. Trademarks and the
    related amortization are included in the related operating
    segment for which they were acquired.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

TJX periodically
    reviews the value of its property and intangible assets in
    relation to the current and expected operating results of the
    related business segments in order to assess whether there has
    been an other than temporary impairment of their carrying
    values. An impairment exists when the undiscounted cash flow of
    an asset is less than the carrying cost of that asset.

Store-by-store

impairment analysis is performed at a minimum on an annual basis
    in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year. An impairment analysis
    is also performed for goodwill and tradenames at a minimum on an
    annual basis in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year. In the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, TJX recorded a pre-tax impairment
    charge of $7.6 million ($5.0 million, after tax, or
    $.01 per share), related to Bob’s Stores, which is
    reflected in Bob’s Stores’ segment results. The
    impairment charge relates to certain long-lived assets and
    intangible assets (specifically the Bob’s Stores tradename
    discussed above) at Bob’s Stores and represents the excess
    of recorded carrying values over the estimated fair value of
    these assets at fiscal 2008 year end.

Advertising Costs:

TJX expenses advertising costs
    as incurred. Advertising expense was $284.1 million,
    $244.7 million and $203.0 million for fiscal 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):

TJX’s foreign assets and liabilities are translated at the
    fiscal year end exchange rate. Activity of the foreign
    operations that affect the statements of income and cash flows
    are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during
    the fiscal year. The translation adjustments associated with the
    foreign operations are included in shareholders’ equity as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
    Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments included in
    shareholders’ equity amounted to a gain of
    $17.8 million, net of related tax effect of
    $23.7 million, as of January 26, 2008; loss of
    $3.2 million, net of related tax effect of
    $15.8 million, as of January 27, 2007; and a loss of
    $23.6 million, net of related tax effect of
    $17.7 million, as of January 28, 2006.

TJX enters into financial instruments to manage our cost of
    borrowing and to manage its exposure to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. TJX recognizes all derivative
    instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statements of
    financial position and measures those instruments at fair value.
    Changes to the fair value of derivative contracts that do not
    qualify for hedge accounting are reported in earnings in the
    period of the change. For derivatives that qualify for hedge
    accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are
    either recorded in shareholders’ equity as a component of
    other comprehensive income or are recognized currently in
    earnings, along with an offsetting adjustment against the basis
    of the item being hedged. Cumulative gains and losses on
    derivatives that have hedged our net investment in foreign
    operations and deferred gains or losses on cash flow hedges that
    have been recorded in other comprehensive income amounted to a
    loss of $42.1 million, net of related tax effects of
    $28.1 million at January 26, 2008; a loss of
    $25.2 million, net of related tax effects of
    $16.8 million at January 27, 2007; and a loss of
    $20.7 million, net of related tax effects of
    $13.8 million at January 28, 2006.

The requirement to recognize the funded status of our post
    retirement benefit plans in accordance with
    SFAS No. 158 (discussed in Note J) resulted
    in a loss adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income
    of $5.6 million, net of related tax effects of
    $3.7 million at January 27, 2007. The cumulative loss
    adjustment at January 26, 2008 was $4.4 million, net
    of related tax effects of $3.7 million at January 26,
    2008. There was no similar adjustment made in fiscal 2006.

Loss Contingencies:

TJX records a reserve for loss
    contingencies when it is both probable that a loss has been
    incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. TJX
    reviews pending litigation and other contingencies at least
    quarterly and adjusts the reserve for such contingencies for
    changes in probable and reasonably estimable losses. TJX
    includes an estimate for related legal costs at the time such
    costs are both probable and reasonably estimable.

New Accounting Standards:

In September 2006, the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
    SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”
    (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for

F-9


measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about
    fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 requires
    companies to disclose fair value measurements of their financial
    instruments according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in
    the standard. Additionally, companies are required to provide
    enhanced disclosure regarding fair value measurements in one of
    the categories (level 3), including a reconciliation of the
    beginning and ending balances separately for each major category
    of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 is effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years, and will be applied prospectively. In February 2008, the
    FASB issued a Staff Position that will (1) partially defer
    the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for
    certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities and
    (2) remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of
    SFAS No. 157. We do not believe the adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our
    results of operations or financial condition.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115,” (SFAS No. 159).
    SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to
    report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value
    and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements
    designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose
    different fair value measurement attributes for similar types of
    assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
    periods within those years and will be effective for TJX in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not believe that
    SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on our
    financial statements.

Reclassifications:

We have reclassified a line
    item on the Consolidated Statements of Income in fiscal 2007 for
    Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs for comparative
    purposes. This reclassification had no impact on net income as
    previously reported.

B.

Provision
    for Computer Intrusion related costs

TJX suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions (the
    intrusion or intrusions, collectively, the “Computer
    Intrusion”) into portions of its computer system, which was
    discovered during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and in which
    it believes customer data were stolen. We face potential
    liabilities and costs as a result of claims, litigation and
    investigations with respect to the Computer Intrusion. During
    the first six months of fiscal 2008, we expensed pre-tax costs
    of $37.8 million for costs we incurred related to the
    Computer Intrusion. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we
    were able to reasonably estimate our potential losses related to
    the Computer Intrusion and, accordingly, established a pre-tax
    reserve of $178.1 million and recorded a pre-tax charge in
    that amount. Subsequently, as previously disclosed we settled
    the purported customer class actions (subject to final court
    approval), settled claims of Visa USA, Visa Inc. and
    substantially all U.S. Visa issuers and settled with most of the
    named plaintiffs in the purported financial institution class
    action. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we reduced our
    reserve and the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs
    by $18.9 million as a result of insurance proceeds with
    respect to the Computer Intrusion, which had not previously been
    reflected in the reserve, as well as a reduction in our
    estimated legal and other fees as we have continued to resolve
    outstanding disputes, litigation and investigations. As of
    January 26, 2008, our reserve balance was
    $117.3 million reflecting amounts paid for settlements
    (primarily the Visa settlement), legal and other fees. Our
    reserve reflects our current estimation of probable losses in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with
    respect to the Computer Intrusion and includes our current
    estimation of total potential cash liabilities, from pending
    litigation, proceedings, investigations and other claims, as
    well as legal and other costs and expenses, arising from the
    Computer Intrusion. In addition we expect to record non-cash
    costs with respect to the customer class actions settlement, if
    finally approved, when incurred, which we do not expect to be
    material to our financial statements. As an estimate, our
    reserve is subject to uncertainty, and our actual costs may vary
    from our current estimate and such variations may be material.
    We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserve to adjust
    for developments in the course and resolution of litigation,
    claims and investigations and related expenses and for other
    changes in our estimates.

C.

Discontinued
    Operations — A.J. Wright store closings

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, management developed a
    plan to close 34 underperforming A.J. Wright stores. The plan
    was approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of
    Directors on November 27, 2006, and virtually all of the
    stores were closed as of the end of fiscal 2007.

In its continuing effort to improve the performance of A.J.
    Wright, management performed an analysis of its store locations
    and operating performance. Management’s plan for the store
    closures was based on several factors, including market
    demographics and proximity to other A.J. Wright stores, cash
    return, sales volume and productivity, recent comparable store
    sales and profit trends and overall market performance. The 34
    stores represented approximately 21% of A.J. Wright’s store
    base, but only 16% of its fiscal 2007 year-to-date sales
    and had store profit margins significantly below

F-10


the average of the A.J. Wright chain (see Note L to our
    consolidated financial statements regarding discontinued
    operations reserves).

We recorded fiscal 2007 fourth quarter pre-tax charges of
    approximately $62 million in connection with these A.J.
    Wright store closures. A summary of the estimated charges (in
    millions) is presented below:

Asset impairments relate primarily to store fixtures and
    leasehold improvements. Lease costs include assumptions about
    the timing and amount of subtenant income and other expenses and
    actual results may cause the lease costs to vary from the above
    estimate.

The above charges do not include the cash impact of
    $24 million of estimated income tax benefits, which
    generally will be realized when lease and severance obligations
    are paid or assets are sold or otherwise disposed of. The
    after-tax cost of the store closings of $38.1 million, or
    $0.08 per share, was recorded as a loss on disposal of
    discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.

In addition to the above charges, we classified the operating
    income (loss) of the 34 closed stores for fiscal 2007, as well
    as all prior periods, as a component of discontinued operations.
    The operating income or loss for each fiscal year equals the
    operating results from store operations, reduced by an
    allocation of direct and incremental distribution and
    administrative costs relating to the closed stores. No interest
    expense was allocated to the discontinued operations. The

The above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero
    coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options
    in fiscal 2014. Any of the notes on which put options are not
    exercised, redeemed or converted will mature in fiscal 2022.

In January 2006, we entered into a C$235.0 million term
    credit facility (through our Canadian division, Winners) due in
    January, 2010. This debt is guaranteed by TJX. Interest is
    payable on borrowings under this facility at rates equal to or
    less than Canadian prime rate. The variable rate on this
    facility was 4.88% at January 26, 2008. The proceeds were
    used to fund the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian
    division as well as other general corporate purposes of this
    division.

In February 2001, TJX issued $517.5 million zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes due in February 2021 and raised
    gross proceeds of $347.6 million. The issue price of the
    notes represented a yield to maturity of 2% per year. Due to the
    first put option on February 13, 2002, we amortized the
    debt discount assuming a 1.5% yield for fiscal 2002. The notes
    are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness
    of TJX. The notes are convertible into 16.9 million shares
    of common stock of TJX if the sale price of our common stock
    reaches specified thresholds, if the credit rating of the notes
    is below investment grade, if the notes are called for
    redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur.
    Each holder of the notes has the right to require us to purchase
    the notes on February 13, 2013 at original purchase price
    plus accrued original issue discount for a total of
    $441.3 million for all notes. We may pay the purchase price
    in cash, TJX stock or a combination of the two. If the holders
    exercise their put options, we expect to fund the payment with
    cash, financing from our short-term credit facility, new
    long-term borrowings or a combination thereof. There were two
    notes put to TJX on February 13, 2007 and three on
    February 13, 2004. In addition, if a change in control of
    TJX occurs on or before February 13, 2013, each holder may
    require TJX to purchase for cash all or a portion of such
    holder’s notes. As of February 13, 2007 we may redeem
    for cash all, or a portion of, the notes at any time for the
    original purchase price plus accrued original issue discount.

The fair value of our general corporate debt, including current
    installments, is estimated by obtaining market value quotes
    given the trading levels of other bonds of the same general
    issuer type and market perceived credit quality. The fair value
    of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes is estimated
    by obtaining market quotes. The fair value of general corporate
    debt, including current installments, at January 26, 2008
    is $448.5 million versus a carrying value of
    $434.2 million. The fair value of the zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes, as of January 26, 2008, is
    $541.4 million versus a net of unamortized debt discount
    carrying value of $398.9 million. These estimates do not
    necessarily reflect certain provisions or restrictions in the
    various debt agreements which might affect our ability to settle
    these obligations.

In fiscal 2007, we amended our $500 million four-year
    revolving credit facility and our $500 million five-year
    revolving credit facility (initially entered into in fiscal
    2006) to extend the maturity dates of these agreements
    until May 2010 and May 2011, respectively. These agreements have
    no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants
    including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to
    earnings. We also have a commercial paper program pursuant to
    which we issue commercial paper from time to time. The revolving
    credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial paper
    program. As of January 26, 2008 there were no outstanding
    amounts under our credit facilities, and we did not borrow under
    these credit facilities during fiscal 2008. The maximum amount
    of our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was
    $204.5 million during fiscal 2007 and $566.5 million
    during fiscal 2006. The weighted average interest rate on our
    U.S. short-term borrowings was 5.35% in fiscal 2007 and
    3.69% in fiscal 2006.

As of January 26, 2008 and January 27, 2007, Winners
    had two credit lines, one for C$10 million for operating
    expenses and one C$10 million letter of credit facility.
    The maximum amount outstanding under Winners Canadian credit
    line for operating expenses was C$5.7 million in fiscal
    2008, C$3.8 million in fiscal 2007 and C$4.6 million
    in fiscal 2006. There were

F-12


no amounts outstanding on either of these lines at the end of
    fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007. As of January 26, 2008, T.K.
    Maxx had a credit line of £20 million. The maximum
    amount outstanding under this line in fiscal 2008 was
    £16.4 million, and there were no outstanding
    borrowings on this credit line at the end of fiscal 2008 or
    fiscal 2007.

Financial
    Instruments

TJX enters into financial instruments to manage its cost of
    borrowing and to manage its exposure to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates.

Interest Rate Contracts:

In December 1999, prior
    to the issuance of $200 million ten-year notes, TJX entered
    into a rate-lock agreement to hedge the underlying treasury rate
    of notes. The cost of this agreement is being amortized to
    interest expense over the term of the notes and results in an
    effective fixed rate of 7.60% on these notes. During fiscal
    2004, TJX entered into interest rate swaps on $100 million
    of the $200 million ten-year notes effectively converting
    the interest on that portion of the unsecured notes from fixed
    to a floating rate of interest indexed to the six-month LIBOR
    rate. The maturity dates of the interest rate swaps is the same
    as the maturity date of the underlying debt. Under these swaps,
    TJX pays a specified variable interest rate and receives the
    fixed rate applicable to the underlying debt. The interest
    income/expense on the swaps is accrued as earned and recorded as
    an adjustment to the interest expense accrued on the fixed-rate
    debt. The interest rate swaps are designated as fair value
    hedges of the underlying debt. The fair value of the contracts,
    excluding the net interest accrual, amounted to an asset of
    $1.2 million, a liability of $4.4 million, and a
    liability of $4.6 million as of January 26, 2008,
    January 27, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively.
    The valuation of the swaps results in an offsetting fair value
    adjustment to the debt hedged; accordingly, long-term debt has
    been increased by $1.2 million in fiscal 2008, reduced by
    $4.4 million in fiscal 2007 and reduced by
    $4.6 million in fiscal 2006. The average effective interest
    rate, on the $100 million of the 7.45% unsecured notes,
    inclusive of the effect of hedging activity, was approximately
    8.77% in fiscal 2008, 9.42% in fiscal 2007 and 8.30% in fiscal
    2006.

During fiscal 2006, concurrent with the issuance of the
    C$235 million three-year note, TJX entered an interest rate
    swap on the principal amount of the note effectively converting
    the interest on the note from floating to a fixed rate of
    interest. The maturity date of the interest rate swap is January
    2009, one year before the maturity date of the underlying debt.
    Under this swap, TJX pays a specified fixed interest rate and
    receives the floating rate applicable to the underlying debt.
    The interest income/expense on the swaps is accrued as earned
    and recorded as an adjustment to the interest expense accrued on
    the floating-rate debt. The interest rate swap is designated as
    cash flow hedge of the underlying debt. The fair value of the
    contract, excluding the net interest accrual, amounted to a
    liability of $1.1 million (C$1.1 million) as of
    January 26, 2008 and an asset of $699,000 (C$825,000) as of
    January 27, 2007. The valuation of the swap results in an
    adjustment to other comprehensive income of a similar amount.
    The average effective interest rate on the note, inclusive of
    the effect of hedging activity, was approximately 4.50% in
    fiscal 2008. We estimate that all $1.1 million
    (C$1.1 million) of losses related to this swap, deferred in
    accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized in
    earnings over the next twelve months.

Foreign Currency Contracts:

TJX enters into
    forward foreign currency exchange contracts to obtain economic
    hedges on firm U.S. dollar and Euro merchandise purchase
    commitments made by its foreign subsidiaries, T.K. Maxx (United
    Kingdom, Ireland and Germany) and Winners (Canada). These
    commitments are typically six months or less in duration. The
    contracts outstanding at January 26, 2008 covered certain
    commitments for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. TJX elected
    not to apply hedge accounting rules to these contracts. The
    change in the fair value of these contracts resulted in income
    of $6.6 million in fiscal 2008, income of $1.2 million
    in fiscal 2007 and expense of $2.5 million in fiscal 2006
    and is included in current earnings as a component of cost of
    sales, including buying and occupancy costs. TJX also enters
    into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to obtain
    economic hedges on certain foreign intercompany payables,
    primarily license fees, for which we elect not to apply hedge
    accounting rules. There were no such contracts outstanding at
    January 26, 2008 and January 27, 2007 thus there was
    no change in fair value of these contracts and no impact to our
    statements of financial position. Any gain or loss on this type
    of contract is ultimately offset by a similar gain or loss on
    the underlying item being hedged.

TJX also enters into foreign currency forward and swap contracts
    in both Canadian dollars and British pound sterling and accounts
    for them as either a hedge of the net investment in and between
    its foreign subsidiaries or (until July 20, 2006 see below)
    as a cash flow hedge of certain long-term intercompany debt. We
    apply hedge accounting to these hedge contracts of our
    investment in foreign operations, and changes in fair value of
    these contracts, as well as gains and losses upon settlement,
    are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income,
    offsetting changes in the cumulative foreign translation
    adjustments of our foreign divisions. The change in fair value
    of the contracts designated as a hedge of our investment in
    foreign operations resulted in a loss of $15.8 million, net
    of income taxes, in fiscal 2008, a loss of $5.6 million,
    net of income

F-13


taxes, in fiscal 2007, and a gain of $15.0 million, net of
    income taxes, in fiscal 2006. The change in the cumulative
    foreign currency translation adjustment resulted in a gain of
    $21.0 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2008, a gain
    of $20.4 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2007, and
    a loss of $32.6 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal
    2006. Amounts included in other comprehensive income relating to
    cash flow hedges are reclassified to earnings as the underlying
    exposure on the debt impacts earnings. The net loss recognized
    in fiscal 2008 related to cash flow contracts was
    $1.1 million, net of income taxes. The net loss recognized
    in fiscal 2007 related to cash flow contracts was
    $5.0 million, net of income taxes. This amount was offset
    by a non-taxable gain of $4.6 million, related to the
    underlying exposure. The net loss recognized in fiscal 2006
    related to cash flow contracts was $13.8 million, net of
    income taxes. This amount was offset by a non-taxable gain of
    $22.5 million, related to the underlying exposure. On
    July 20, 2006 TJX determined that the C$355 million
    intercompany loan, due from Winners to TJX, would not be payable
    in the foreseeable future due to the capital and cash flow needs
    of Winners. As a result, the intercompany loan and the related
    currency swap were re-designated as a net investment in a
    foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency gains or losses
    on the intercompany loan and gains or losses on the related
    currency swap from re-designation date forward, to the extent
    effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income. The
    ineffective portion of the currency swap resulted in a pre-tax
    charge to the income statement of $9.1 million and
    $2.9 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively.

TJX also enters into derivative contracts, generally designated
    as fair value hedges, to hedge intercompany debt and
    intercompany interest payable. The changes in fair value of
    these contracts are recorded in the statements of income and are
    offset by marking the underlying item to fair value in the same
    period. Upon settlement, the realized gains and losses on these
    contracts are offset by the realized gains and losses of the
    underlying item in the statement of income. The net impact on
    the income statement of hedging activity related to these
    intercompany payables was income of $2.5 million in fiscal
    2008, and immaterial amounts in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006.

The value of foreign currency exchange contracts relating to
    inventory commitments is reported in current earnings as a
    component of cost of sales, including buying and occupancy
    costs. The income statement impact of all other derivative
    contracts and underlying exposures is reported as a component of
    selling, general and administrative expenses.

TJX’s forward foreign currency exchange and swap contracts
    require TJX to make payments of certain foreign currencies or
    U.S. dollars for receipt of Canadian dollars,
    U.S. dollars or Euros. All of these contracts, except the
    contracts relating to our investment in our foreign operations,
    mature during fiscal 2009. The British pound sterling investment
    hedges mature during fiscal 2009 and the Canadian dollar
    investment hedge contracts and interest rate swap contracts have
    maturities from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010.

The counterparties to the forward exchange contracts and swap
    agreements are major international financial institutions and
    the contracts contain rights of offset, which minimize our
    exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by one of
    the counterparties. We do not require counterparties to maintain
    collateral for these contracts. We periodically monitor our
    position and the credit ratings of the counterparties and do not
    anticipate losses resulting from the nonperformance of these
    institutions.

F.

Commitments

TJX is committed under long-term leases related to its
    continuing operations for the rental of real estate and fixtures
    and equipment. Most of our leases are store operating leases
    with a ten-year initial term and options to extend for one or
    more five-year periods. Certain Marshalls leases, acquired in
    fiscal 1996, had remaining terms ranging up to twenty-five
    years. Leases for T.K. Maxx are generally for fifteen to
    twenty-five years with ten-year kick-out options. Many of the
    leases contain escalation clauses and early termination
    penalties. In addition, we are generally required to pay
    insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses
    including, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales
    which aggregated to approximately one-third of the total minimum
    rent for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2008 and
    January 27, 2007, respectively.

Following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for
    continuing operations as of January 26, 2008:

The capital lease commitment relates to a 283,000-square-foot
    addition to TJX’s home office facility. Rental payments
    commenced June 1, 2001, and we recognized a capital lease
    asset and related obligation equal to the present value of the
    lease payments of $32.6 million.

Rental expense under operating leases for continuing operations
    amounted to $896.6 million, $837.6 million, and
    $774.9 million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Rental expense includes contingent rent and is
    reported net of sublease income. Contingent rent paid was
    $9.7 million, $9.0 million, and $7.1 million in
    fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively; and sublease income
    was $2.9 million in fiscal 2008; and $3.0 million in
    fiscal 2007 and 2006. The total net

F-15


present value of TJX’s minimum operating lease obligations
    approximates $4,404.6 million as of January 26, 2008.

TJX had outstanding letters of credit totaling
    $32.7 million as of January 26, 2008 and
    $43.8 million as of January 27, 2007. Letters of
    credit are issued by TJX primarily for the purchase of inventory.

G.

Stock
    Compensation Plans

In November 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the
    “modified retrospective” method. The total
    compensation cost related to stock based compensation was
    $37.0 million net of income taxes of $20.3 million in
    fiscal 2008, $45.1 million net of income taxes of
    $24.7 million in fiscal 2007, and $58.9 million net of
    income taxes of $32.3 million in fiscal 2006.

As of January 26, 2008, there was $73.5 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
    share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan.
    That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
    period of 2.0 years. The total fair value of shares vested
    in fiscal 2008 was $56.6 million.

TJX has a stock incentive plan under which options and other
    stock awards may be granted to its directors, officers and key
    employees. This plan has been approved by TJX’s
    shareholders, and all stock compensation awards are made under
    this plan. The Stock Incentive Plan, as amended with shareholder
    approval, provides for the issuance of up to 145.3 million
    shares with 17.0 million shares available for future grants
    as of January 26, 2008. TJX issues shares from authorized
    but unissued common stock. On December 6, 2005, the Board
    of Directors of TJX determined that beginning in fiscal 2007,
    non-employee directors would no longer be awarded stock option
    grants under the Stock Incentive Plan, and the plan was amended
    to eliminate such awards.

Under the Stock Incentive Plan, TJX has granted options for the
    purchase of common stock, generally within ten years from the
    grant date at option prices of 100% of market price on the grant
    date. Most options outstanding vest over a three-year period
    starting one year after the grant, and are exercisable in their
    entirety three years after the grant date. Options granted to
    directors, prior to the amendment eliminating such awards,
    became fully exercisable one year after the date of grant.

For purposes of applying the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), the fair value of each option granted
    during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
    following weighted average assumptions:

    option granted. We use historical data to estimate option
    exercise, employee termination behavior and dividend yield
    within the valuation model. Separate employee groups and option
    characteristics are considered separately for valuation purposes
    when applicable. No such distinctions existed in fiscal 2008 or
    2007. See discussion regarding non-employee directors’
    option awards eliminated in fiscal 2007 above. The expected
    option life represents an estimate of the period of time options
    are expected to remain outstanding based upon historical
    exercise trends. The risk free rate is for periods within the
    contractual life of the option based on the U.S. Treasury
    yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.

Restricted Stock and Other Awards Pursuant to the Stock
    Incentive Plan:

TJX has also issued restricted stock and
    performance-based restricted stock awards under the Stock
    Incentive Plan. Restricted stock awards are issued at no cost to
    the recipient of the award, and have service restrictions that
    generally lapse over three to four years from date of grant.
    Performance-based shares are also issued at no cost to the
    recipient of the award and have restrictions that generally
    lapse over one to four years when and if specified performance
    criteria are met. The grant date fair value of the award is
    charged to income ratably over the period during which these
    awards vest. The fair value of the awards is determined at date
    of grant and assumes that performance goals will be achieved. If
    such goals are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and
    any recognized compensation cost is reversed.

A combined total of 200,341 shares, 236,000 shares and
    377,000 shares for restricted and performance-based awards
    were issued in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    59,814 shares were forfeited during fiscal 2008,
    7,125 shares were forfeited during fiscal 2007 and
    18,750 shares were forfeited during fiscal 2006. The
    weighted average market value per share of these stock awards at
    grant date was $24.90 for fiscal 2008, $27.16 for fiscal 2007
    and $21.14 for fiscal 2006.

The fair value of restricted stock vested was $3.9 million
    in fiscal 2008, $4.9 million in fiscal 2007 and
    $11.9 million in fiscal 2006.

In November 2005, we issued a market based deferred share award
    to our acting chief executive officer which was indexed to our
    stock price for the

sixty-day

period beginning February 22, 2007 (“measurement
    period”) whereby the executive could earn up to
    94,000 shares of TJX stock. The weighted average grant date
    fair value of this award was $9.90 per share. In June 2007,
    58,750 shares were issued under this award. In September
    2007, this officer received a special award of 25,000 shares of
    common stock.

TJX also awards deferred shares to its outside directors under
    the Stock Incentive Plan. The outside directors are awarded two
    annual deferred share awards, each representing shares of TJX
    common stock valued at $50,000. One award vests immediately and
    is payable with accumulated dividends in stock at the earlier of
    separation from service as a director or change of control. The
    second award vests based on service as a director until the
    annual meeting next following the award and is payable with
    accumulated dividends in stock at vesting date, unless an
    irrevocable advance election is made whereby it is payable at
    the same time as the first award. As of the end of fiscal 2008,
    a total of 117,336 deferred shares had been awarded under the
    plan. Actual shares will be issued at termination of service or
    a change of control.

Capital
    Stock and Earnings Per Share

Capital Stock:

In August 2007, we completed a
    $1 billion stock repurchase program begun in fiscal 2006
    and initiated another multi-year $1 billion stock
    repurchase program that had been approved in January 2007. We
    repurchased and retired 33.3 million shares of our common
    stock at a cost of $950.2 million during fiscal 2008. TJX
    reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a
    “settlement” basis. We had cash expenditures under our
    repurchase programs of $940.2 million, $557.2 million
    and $603.7 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, funded primarily by cash generated from
    operations. The total common shares repurchased amounted to
    33.0 million shares in fiscal 2008, 22.0 million
    shares in fiscal 2007 and 25.9 million shares in fiscal
    2006. As of January 26, 2008, we had repurchased
    17.8 million shares of our common stock at a cost of
    $514.0 million under the current $1 billion stock
    repurchase program. All shares repurchased under our stock
    repurchase programs have been retired. In February 2008, our
    Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion stock
    repurchase program which was in addition to the
    $486.0 million remaining under our existing $1 billion
    authorization at January 26, 2008.

TJX temporarily suspended buyback activity from the discovery of
    the Computer Intrusion (December 2006) until adoption of a

Rule 10b5-1

plan at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

TJX has authorization to issue up to 5 million shares of
    preferred stock, par value $1. There was no preferred stock
    issued or outstanding at January 26, 2008.

The fiscal 2008 total net deferred tax asset is presented on the
    balance sheet as a current asset of $163.5 million and a
    non-current liability of $42.9 million. For fiscal 2007,
    the net deferred tax asset is presented on the balance sheet as
    a current asset of $35.8 million and a non-current
    liability of $21.5 million. TJX has provided for deferred
    U.S. taxes on all undistributed earnings from its Canadian
    subsidiary through January 26, 2008. TJX changed its
    assertion during fiscal 2008 regarding the undistributed
    earnings of its Marshalls Puerto Rico subsidiary. The earnings
    of this subsidiary are no longer considered indefinitely
    reinvested. As a result, the Company recognized a
    $5.5 million tax benefit after providing for deferred
    U.S. taxes for this subsidiary. All earnings of TJX’s
    other foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested and no
    deferred taxes have been provided on those earnings. The net
    deferred tax asset summarized above includes deferred taxes
    relating to temporary differences at our foreign operations and
    amounted to a $26.7 million net liability as of
    January 26, 2008 and a $26.6 million net liability as
    of January 27, 2007.

Tax legislation enacted in 2004, allowed companies to repatriate
    the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations in fiscal
    2006 at an effective U.S. federal income tax rate of 5.25%.
    TJX recognized a one-time tax benefit of $47 million, or
    $.10 per share, from the repatriation of
    U.S. $259.5 million of Canadian earnings during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. In addition, during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006, TJX corrected its accounting for the tax
    impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans.
    We had previously established a deferred tax liability on these
    gains which are not taxable. The impact of correcting for the
    tax treatment of these gains results in a tax benefit of
    $22 million. The cumulative impact of this adjustment
    through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was
    $18.2 million, all of which was recorded in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006. Of the $18.2 million,
    $10.1 million related to fiscal 2005.

TJX’s HomeGoods subsidiary has a Puerto Rico net operating
    loss carryforward of approximately $1.1 million that may be
    applied against future taxable income of its HomeGoods
    operations in Puerto Rico. The future tax benefit of this loss
    carryforward, which expires in fiscal 2014, has not been
    recognized. In fiscal 2006, TJX utilized a United Kingdom net
    operating loss carryforward of approximately $2.4 million.
    There have been no United Kingdom net operating losses for
    periods subsequent to January 28, 2006. TJX’s German
    subsidiary, which is treated as a branch for U.S. tax
    purposes, incurred a net operating loss of $14.4 million
    for tax and financial reporting purposes during fiscal 2008. The
    loss was fully utilized to reduce the Company’s current
    U.S. taxable income. Any future utilization of the loss in
    Germany will result in a corresponding amount of taxable income
    for U.S. tax purposes. TJX’s worldwide effective
    income tax rate was 37.9% for fiscal 2008, 37.7%

F-20


for fiscal 2007 and 31.6% for fiscal 2006. The difference

TJX adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN 48), in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. FIN 48
    clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a
    minimum threshold for benefit recognition of a tax position for
    financial statement purposes. FIN 48 also establishes tax
    accounting rules for measurement, classification, interest and
    penalties, disclosure and interim period accounting. As a result
    of the implementation, the Company recognized a charge of
    approximately $27.2 million to its retained earnings
    balance at the beginning of fiscal 2008. The Company had
    unrecognized tax benefits of $140.7 million as of
    January 26, 2008 and $124.4 million as of
    January 28, 2007.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Balance at January 26, 2008

$

232,859

Included in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are
    items that will not impact future effective tax rates upon
    recognition. These items amount to $67.8 million as of
    January 26, 2008 and $28.2 million as of
    January 28, 2007.

The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as
    income tax in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
    In nearly all jurisdictions, the tax years through fiscal 2001
    are no longer subject to examination.

The Company’s continuing accounting policy classifies
    interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of
    income tax expense. The amount of interest and penalties
    expensed was $16.2 million for the year ended
    January 26, 2008. The accrued amounts for interest and
    penalties are $52.5 million as of January 26, 2008 and
    $36.3 million as of January 28, 2007.

Based on the outcome of tax examinations, judicial proceedings
    or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations in
    specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that
    unrecognized tax benefits for certain tax positions taken on
    previously filed tax returns may change materially from those
    represented on the financial statements as January 26,
    2008. However, based on the status of current audits and the
    protocol of finalizing audits, which may include formal legal
    proceedings, it is not possible to estimate the impact of such
    changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions.

Pension
    Plans and Other Retirement Benefits

Pension:

TJX has a funded defined benefit
    retirement plan covering the majority of its full-time
    U.S. employees. Employees who have attained twenty-one
    years of age and have completed one year of service are covered
    under the plan. No employee contributions are required and
    benefits are based on compensation earned in each year of
    service. New employees after February 1, 2006 do not
    participate in this plan but are eligible to receive enhanced
    employer contributions to their 401(k) plans. This plan
    amendment did not have a material impact on fiscal 2008 or
    fiscal 2007 pension expense, but is expected to reduce net
    periodic pension costs in subsequent years due to a reduction in
    participants. Our funded defined benefit retirement plan assets
    are invested in domestic and international equity and fixed
    income securities, both directly and through investment funds.
    The plan does not invest in the securities of TJX. We also have
    an unfunded supplemental

F-21


retirement plan which covers key employees and provides for
    certain employees additional retirement benefits based on
    average compensation.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — An amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132 (R)” (SFAS No. 158).
    SFAS No. 158 requires the recognition of the funded
    status of a benefit plan in the balance sheet; the recognition
    in other comprehensive income of gains or losses and prior
    service costs or credits arising during the period but which are
    not included as components of periodic benefit cost; the
    measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of
    the balance sheet date (the measurement provisions); and
    disclosure of additional information about the effects on
    periodic benefit cost for the following fiscal year arising from
    delayed recognition in the current period. The recognition of
    the funded status of plans on the balance sheet was required for
    our fiscal year ended January 27, 2007. The adjustment to
    accumulated other comprehensive income of initially applying the
    recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 for our pension
    and postretirement plans was a reduction, net of taxes, of
    $5.6 million in fiscal 2007. The impact of adopting
    SFAS No. 158 on individual line items of the balance
    sheet as of January 27, 2007 is summarized below:

TJX deferred the implementation of the measurement provisions of
    SFAS No. 158 until fiscal 2008. The impact of adopting
    the measurement provisions was to increase our post retirement
    liabilities by $2.7 million and an adjustment to retained
    earnings of $1.6 million, net of income taxes of
    $1.1 million, which represents the net benefit cost from
    January 1, 2007 to January 27, 2007. The valuation
    date for both plans in fiscal 2007 was as of December 31,
    2006.

The consolidated balance sheet as of January 26, 2008
    reflects the funded status of the plans after initial adoption
    of SFAS No. 158 whereby unrecognized prior service
    cost and actuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss). The combined net accrued
    liability of $62.9 million at January 26, 2008 is
    reflected on the balance sheet as a current liability of
    $2.7 million and a long term liability of
    $60.2 million.

As of January 27, 2007, the combined net accrued liability
    of $60.1 million at January 27, 2007 is reflected on
    the balance sheet as a current liability of $3.4 million
    and a long term liability of $56.7 million.

The estimated prior service cost that will be amortized from
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic
    benefit cost in fiscal 2009 is $57,468 for the funded plan and
    $124,652 for the unfunded plan. The estimated net actuarial loss
    that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in fiscal 2009 is
    $568,533 for the unfunded plan. None of the net actuarial loss
    will be amortized for the funded plan in fiscal 2009. Weighted

We made aggregate cash contributions of $27.5 million,
    $7.4 million and $42.0 million for fiscal 2008, 2007
    and 2006, respectively, to the defined benefit retirement plan
    and to fund current benefit and expense payments under the
    unfunded supplemental retirement plan. The cash contribution in
    fiscal 2007 was solely to fund current benefit and expense
    payments under the unfunded supplemental retirement plan. Our
    funding policy for our funded plan is to fund any required
    contribution to the plan at the full funding limitation and
    generally to fund contributions in excess of any required
    contribution so as to fully fund the accumulated benefit
    obligation to the extent such contribution is allowed for tax
    purposes. As a result of voluntary funding contributions made in
    fiscal 2006 and prior years, there was no required funding in

F-23


fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2008. As a result of the additional
    voluntary funding in fiscal 2008 we do not anticipate any
    required funding in fiscal 2009 for the defined benefit
    retirement plan. We anticipate making contributions of
    $2.7 million to fund current benefit and expense payments
    under the unfunded supplemental retirement plan in fiscal 2009.

We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of
    equities and fixed income investments is used to seek to
    maximize the long-term return on plan assets with a prudent
    level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through
    consideration of plan liabilities, funded plan status and
    corporate financial condition. The investment portfolio contains
    a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
    Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across
    U.S. and

non-U.S. stocks,

as well as stocks of companies with small and large
    capitalizations. Both actively managed and passively invested
    portfolios may be utilized for U.S. equity investments.
    Other assets such as real estate funds, private equity funds,
    and hedge funds are currently used for their diversification and
    return enhancing characteristics. Derivatives may be used to
    reduce market exposure; however, derivatives may not be used to
    leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying
    investments. We hold certain investments in the plan which do
    not have a readily determinable market value, fair market value
    of these investments is based on amounts obtained from
    investment managers and we believe these are a reasonable
    estimate. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks,
    such as interest rate, credit and overall market volatility. As
    such, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of
    investments will occur in the near term and such changes could
    affect the amounts reported. Investment risk is measured and
    monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment
    portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic
    asset/liability studies.

We employ a building block approach in determining the long-term
    rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied
    and long-term historical relationships between equities and
    fixed income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted
    capital market principle that assets with higher volatility
    generate a greater return over the long term. Current market
    factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated
    before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.
    Consideration is also given to asset class diversification and
    rebalancing as well as to the expected returns likely to be
    earned over the life of the plan by each category of plan
    assets. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed for
    reasonability and appropriateness.

Included in the net periodic pension cost of the unfunded plan
    TJX incurred special termination benefits of $168,000 in fiscal
    2008 and $1.4 million in fiscal 2007.

The unrecognized gains and losses in excess of 10% of the
    projected benefit obligation are amortized over the average
    remaining service life of participants. In addition, for the
    unfunded plan, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses that
    exceed 30% of the projected benefit obligation are fully
    recognized in net periodic pension cost.

TJX also sponsors an employee savings plan under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for all
    eligible U.S. employees. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, assets under the plan totaled $688.3 million and
    $633.8 million, respectively, and are invested in a variety
    of funds. Employees may contribute up to 50% of eligible pay,
    subject to limitation. TJX matches employee contributions, up to
    5% of eligible pay, at rates ranging from 25% to 50%, based upon
    the Company’s performance. Employees hired after
    February 1, 2006 are eligible for participation in the plan
    with an enhanced matching formula beginning five years after
    hire date. TJX contributed $10.2 million in fiscal 2008,
    $11.4 million in fiscal 2007 and $7.9 million in
    fiscal 2006 to the 401(k) plan. Employees cannot invest their
    contributions in the TJX stock fund option in the 401(k) plan,
    and may elect to invest up to only 50% of the Company’s
    contribution in the TJX stock fund. The TJX stock fund

F-25


has no other trading restrictions. The TJX stock fund represents
    3.5%, 3.8% and 3.5% of plan investments at December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

TJX also has a nonqualified savings plan for certain
    U.S. employees. TJX matches employee contributions at
    various rates which amounted to $1.2 million in fiscal
    2008, $1.2 million in fiscal 2007, and $313,000 in fiscal
    2006. TJX transfers employee withholdings and the related
    company match to a separate trust designated to fund the future
    obligations. The trust assets, which are invested in a variety
    of mutual funds, are included in other assets on the balance
    sheets.

In addition to the plans described above, we also maintain
    retirement/deferred savings plans for all eligible associates at
    our foreign subsidiaries. We contributed $4.1 million,
    $3.6 million and $3.0 million for these plans in
    fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Postretirement Medical:

TJX has an unfunded
    postretirement medical plan that provides limited postretirement
    medical and life insurance benefits to employees who participate
    in its retirement plan and who retire at age 55 or older
    with ten or more years of service. During the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006, TJX eliminated this benefit for all active
    associates and modified the benefit to current retirees enrolled
    in the plan. The plan amendment replaces the previous medical
    benefits with a defined amount (up to $35.00 per month) that
    approximates the retirees cost of enrollment in the Medicare
    Plan.

Effective January 1, 2007, we elected to change the
    measurement date used to determine the Net Periodic Benefit Cost
    for fiscal 2008 from January 1, 2007 to January 27,
    2007 as required under SFAS 158. Under the Alternative
    Method, we recorded an adjustment to retained earnings in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2008 pursuant to this change. The
    valuation date for the unfunded postretirement medical plan
    obligation for fiscal 2007 is as of December 31, 2006.

The prior service cost credit is a result of the amendment to
    plan benefits in fiscal 2006 and resulted in a negative plan
    amendment which is being amortized into income over the average
    remaining life of the active plan participants. The estimated
    prior service credit that will be amortized from accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic cost in
    fiscal 2009 is $3.8 million. The net actuarial loss that
    will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in fiscal 2009 is $308,000.

As of January 26, 2008, the net accrued liability of the
    postretirement medical plan is reflected on the consolidated
    balance sheets as a non-current liability of $1.1 million
    and a current liability of approximately $204,000. As of
    January 27, 2007, the net accrued liability of the
    postretirement medical plan is reflected on the consolidated
    balance sheets as a non-current liability of $1.3 million
    and a current liability of approximately $205,000.

Discontinued
    Operations Reserve and Related Contingent Liabilities

We have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued
    operations that relates primarily to real estate leases
    associated with our 34 discontinued A.J. Wright stores (see
    Note C) as well as leases of former TJX businesses. The
    balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three
    fiscal years is presented below:

The exit costs related to our 34 discontinued A.J. Wright
    stores (see Note C) resulted in an addition to the reserve
    of $62 million in fiscal 2007. The other additions to the
    reserve for lease related obligations in fiscal 2007 and fiscal
    2006 were the result of periodic adjustments to our estimated
    lease obligations of our former businesses and were offset by
    income from creditor recoveries of a similar amount. The lease
    related charges against the reserve during fiscal 2007 and
    fiscal 2006 relate primarily to our former businesses. The fixed
    asset write-offs and other charges against the reserve for
    fiscal 2007 and all of the charges against the reserve in fiscal
    2008, relate primarily to the 34 A.J. Wright closed stores.

Approximately $32 million of the reserve balance at fiscal
    2008 year end and $43 million of the reserve balance
    at fiscal 2007 year end relates to the A.J. Wright store
    closings, primarily our estimation of lease costs, net of
    estimated subtenant income. The remainder of the reserve
    reflects our estimation of the cost of claims, updated
    quarterly, that have been, or we believe are likely to be, made
    against TJX for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of
    the leases of former businesses, after mitigation of the number
    and cost of lease obligations. At January 26, 2008,
    substantially all the leases of the former businesses that were
    rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted
    liability against TJX had been resolved. The actual net cost of
    A.J. Wright lease obligations may differ from our initial
    estimate. Although TJX’s actual costs with respect to the
    lease obligations of former businesses may exceed amounts
    estimated in our reserve, and TJX may incur costs for leases
    from these former businesses that were not terminated or had not
    expired, TJX does not expect to incur any material costs related
    to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts
    estimated. We estimate that the majority of the discontinued
    operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years.
    The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how
    the remaining lease obligations are actually settled.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of
    BJ’s Wholesale Club, another former TJX business, for which
    BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for
    discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because
    we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX
    with respect to these leases is remote due to the current
    financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club.

M.

Guarantees
    and Contingent Obligations

We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a
    lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties
    without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we
    have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or
    guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the
    exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed
    above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned
    leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will
    have a material adverse impact on our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have
    sufficient information about these leases to estimate our
    potential contingent obligations under them, which could be
    triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants
    does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of
    these leases.

We also have contingent obligations in connection with some
    assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We
    estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our
    reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations,
    BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed in Note L to the
    consolidated financial statements and properties of our
    discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants
    did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately
    $105 million as of

F-29


January 26, 2008. We believe that most or all of these
    contingent obligations will not revert to TJX and, to the extent
    they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to
    mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which we may be
    obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of
    warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
    sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
    These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
    There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
    respect to these contingent obligations.

N.

Supplemental
    Cash Flows Information

The cash flows required to satisfy contingent obligations of the
    discontinued operations as discussed in Note L, are
    classified as a reduction in cash provided by continuing
    operations. There are no remaining operating activities relating
    to these operations.

TJX’s cash payments for interest and income taxes and
    non-cash investing and financing activities are as follows:

Segment
    Information

The T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store chains are managed on a
    combined basis and are reported as the Marmaxx segment. The
    Winners and HomeSense chains are also managed on a combined
    basis and operate stores exclusively in Canada. T.K. Maxx
    operates stores in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany. For
    fiscal 2008, Winners, HomeSense and T.K. Maxx accounted for 23%
    of TJX’s net sales, 23% of segment profit and 23% of all
    consolidated assets. All of our other chains operate stores
    exclusively in the United States with the exception of 14 stores
    operated in Puerto Rico by Marshalls which include 6 HomeGoods
    locations in a “Marshalls Mega Store” format. All of
    our stores, with the exception of HomeGoods, HomeSense and
    Bob’s Stores sell apparel for the entire family, including
    footwear, jewelry and accessories and a limited offering of
    giftware and home fashions. The HomeGoods and HomeSense stores
    offer home fashions and home furnishings. Bob’s Stores is a
    value-oriented retailer of branded family apparel. By
    merchandise category, we derived approximately 63% of our sales
    from apparel (including footwear), 25% from home fashions and
    12% from jewelry and accessories in fiscal 2008.

We evaluate the performance of our segments based on
    “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax
    income before general corporate expense and interest.
    “Segment profit or loss,” as defined by TJX, may not
    be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
    entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be
    considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from
    operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a
    measure of liquidity.
