Cautionary
    Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Our disclosure and analysis in this

Form 10-K

and in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders contain
    “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of
    the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including
    some of the statements in this

Form 10-K

under Item 1, “Business,” Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8,
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and in
    our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders under “Letter to
    Shareholders” and “Financial Graphs.”
    Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks,
    uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Such
    statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future
    events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current
    facts. We have generally identified such statements by using
    words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “could,” “estimate,” “expect,”
    “forecast,” “intend,” “looking
    forward,” “may,” “plan,”
    “potential,” “project,” “should,”
    “target,” “will” and “would” or
    any variations of these words or other words with similar
    meanings. All statements that address activities, events or
    developments that we intend, expect or believe may occur in the
    future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, or Exchange Act. These “forward looking
    statements” may relate to such matters as our future
    actions, future performance or results of current and
    anticipated sales, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange
    rates and the outcome of contingencies such as legal
    proceedings, and financial results.

We cannot guarantee that the results and other expectations
    expressed, anticipated or implied in any forward-looking
    statement will be realized. The risks set forth under
    Item 1A of this

Form 10-K

describe major risks to our business. A variety of factors
    including these risks could cause our actual results and other
    expectations to differ materially from the anticipated results
    or other expectations expressed, anticipated or implied in our
    forward-looking statements. Should known or unknown risks
    materialize, or should our underlying assumptions prove
    inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past
    results and those anticipated, estimated or projected in the
    forward – looking statements. You should bear this in mind
    as you consider forward-looking statements.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the dates on
    which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to
    update any forward-looking statement, whether to reflect new
    information, future events or otherwise. You are advised,
    however, to consult any further disclosures we may make in our
    future reports to the SEC or otherwise.




Part I.

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

BUSINESS
    OVERVIEW

The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is the leading off-price apparel
    and home fashions retailer in the United States and worldwide.
    Our over 2,600 stores offer a rapidly changing assortment of
    quality, brand-name and designer merchandise at prices generally
    20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices
    every day.

Retail Concepts.

We operate seven off-price retail
    concepts in the U.S., Canada and Europe and are known for our
    treasure hunt shopping experience and excellent values. The
    operating platforms and strategies of all of our retail concepts
    are synergistic. Therefore, we capitalize on our off-price
    expertise and systems throughout our business, leverage best
    practices, initiatives and new ideas across our concepts,
    utilize the substantial buying power of our businesses to
    leverage our global relationships with vendors, and develop
    talent by providing opportunities across our concepts.

In the United States:

—

T.J. MAXX and MARSHALLS:

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
    are the largest off-price retailers in the United States with
    1,680 stores. We founded T.J. Maxx in 1976 and acquired
    Marshalls in 1995. Both chains sell family apparel (including
    footwear and accessories), home fashions (including home basics,
    accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative
    accessories and giftware) and other merchandise, primarily
    targeting the middle to upper-middle income customer
    demographic. We maintain the separate identities of T.J. Maxx
    and Marshalls through different product assortment (including an
    expanded assortment of fine jewelry and accessories at T.J. Maxx
    and a full line of footwear and broader men’s and
    juniors’ offerings at Marshalls), in-store initiatives,
    marketing and store appearance. The differentiated shopping
    experience at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls encourages our customers
    to shop both chains.

—

HOMEGOODS:

HomeGoods, introduced in 1992, is
    an off-price retailer of home fashions in the U.S. Through
    318 stores, it sells a broad array of home basics, giftware,
    accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative
    accessories, children’s furniture, seasonal merchandise and
    other fashions for the home.

—

A.J. WRIGHT:

Launched in 1998, A.J. Wright, like
    T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, sells off-price family apparel, home
    fashions and other merchandise. Catering to the entire family,
    key apparel categories for A.J. Wright’s 135 stores include
    basics, children’s, women’s plus sizes, juniors, young
    men’s and footwear. Different from all of our other chains,
    A.J. Wright primarily targets the moderate-income customer
    demographic.

In Canada:

—

WINNERS:

Acquired in 1990, Winners is the
    leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in Canada.
    The merchandise offering at its 202 stores across Canada is
    similar to T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. In 2008, Winners began
    testing StyleSense, a new concept that offers family footwear
    and accessories.

—

HOMESENSE:

HomeSense introduced the home
    fashions off-price concept to Canada in 2001. The chain has 75
    stores offering a merchandise mix of home fashions similar to
    HomeGoods.

In Europe:

—

T.K. MAXX:

Launched in 1994, T.K. Maxx introduced
    off-price to the U.K. and is Europe’s only major off-price
    retailer of apparel and home fashions. With 235 stores, T.K.
    Maxx operates in the U.K. and Ireland and expanded to Germany in
    2007. T.K. Maxx offers a merchandise mix similar to T.J. Maxx
    and Marshalls in the U.S. and Winners in Canada.



—

HOMESENSE:

HomeSense introduced the home
    fashions off-price concept to the U.K. in 2008 and its seven
    stores offer a merchandise mix of home fashions in the U.K. like
    that of HomeGoods in the U.S. and HomeSense in Canada.

Flexible Business Model:

Our off-price business
    model is flexible, particularly for a company of our size,
    allowing us to react to market trends. Our opportunistic buying
    and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to
    adjust the merchandise in our stores more frequently than
    traditional retailers, and our stores and distribution centers
    are built to support this flexibility. By maintaining a liquid
    inventory position, our merchants can buy close to need,
    enabling them to buy into current market trends and take
    advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. Buying close to
    need gives us the ability to turn our inventory more rapidly and
    adjust our pricing to the current market more frequently than
    conventional retailers. Our selling floor space is flexible,
    without walls between departments and largely free of permanent
    fixtures, so we can easily expand and contract departments in
    response to customer demand, available merchandise and fashion
    trends. Our distribution facilities are designed to accommodate
    our methods of receiving and shipping both small and large
    quantities of product to our large store base quickly and
    efficiently.

Opportunistic Buying:

We are distinguished from
    traditional retailers by our opportunistic buying of brand name,
    fashionable merchandise. We purchase the majority of the
    inventory for our apparel chains and a significant portion of
    the inventory for our home fashion chains opportunistically. Our
    merchant organization numbers over 600. In contrast to
    traditional retailers, which typically order goods far in
    advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor,
    our merchants are in the marketplace virtually every week,
    buying primarily for the current selling season, and to a
    limited extent, for a future selling season.

Due to the unpredictable nature of supply and consumer demand in
    the highly fragmented apparel and home fashions marketplace, we
    are able to buy the vast majority of our opportunistic inventory
    directly from manufacturers, with some coming from other
    retailers and sources. We source from a vendor universe of over
    10,000 vendors a year and purchase virtually all of our
    inventory at discounts from initial wholesale prices. A small
    percentage of the merchandise we sell is private label
    merchandise produced specifically for us by third party
    manufacturers.

We believe a number of factors make us an attractive outlet for
    the vendor community and provide us excellent access on an
    ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise. We are willing to
    purchase less-than-full assortments of items, styles and sizes,
    pay promptly and do not ask for typical retail concessions (such
    as advertising, promotional and markdown allowances), delivery
    concessions (such as drop shipments to stores or delayed
    deliveries) or return privileges. We are able to purchase
    quantities of inventory that range from small to very large and
    we have the ability to sell product through a geographically
    diverse network of stores. Importantly, in TJX, we offer vendors
    an outlet with financial strength and an excellent credit rating.

Inventory Management:

We offer our customers a
    rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a
    “treasure hunt” experience in our stores. To achieve
    this, we seek to rapidly turn the inventory in our stores,
    regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions
    at excellent values. Our specialized inventory planning,
    purchasing, monitoring and markdown systems, coupled with
    distribution center storage, processing, handling and shipping
    systems, enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to
    local preferences, achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover on
    a vast array of products and sell substantially all merchandise
    within targeted selling periods. Pricing and markdown decisions
    and store inventory replenishment are determined centrally,
    using information provided by specialized computer systems, and
    are designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely
    and disciplined manner. We do not generally engage in
    promotional pricing activity.

Low Cost Operations:

We operate with a low cost
    structure compared to many other traditional retailers. We focus
    aggressively on expenses throughout our business, including
    merchandise and non-merchandise procurement. Our advertising
    budget as a percentage of sales is low compared to traditional
    retailers. We design our stores, generally located in community
    shopping centers, to provide a pleasant, convenient shopping
    environment but do not spend heavily on store fixtures.
    Additionally, our distribution network is designed to run cost
    effectively.



Customer Service:

While we offer a self-service
    format, we train our store associates to provide friendly and
    helpful customer service. We also have customer-friendly return
    policies. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash,
    credit cards and debit cards. In the U.S., we offer a co-branded
    TJX credit card and a private label credit card, both through a
    major bank, but do not maintain customer credit receivables
    related to either program.

Distribution:

We operate 13 distribution centers
    in the U.S., 2 in Canada and 4 in the U.K. Our distribution
    centers encompass approximately 11 million square feet. We
    ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through
    these distribution centers, which are large, highly automated
    and built to suit our specific, off-price business model, as
    well as warehouses operated by third parties. We shipped
    approximately 1.5 billion units to our stores during fiscal
    2009.

Store Growth:

Expansion of our business through
    the addition of new stores is an important part of our strategy
    for TJX as a global, off-price, value company. The following
    table provides information on the growth and potential growth of
    each of our chains:

    family footwear, and Winners opened 2 StyleSense stores in
    Canada in fiscal 2009, which sell family footwear and
    accessories. Some of our HomeGoods and HomeSense stores are
    co-located with one of our apparel stores in a superstore

Segment Overview:

We operate five business
    segments: three in the U.S. and one in each of Canada and
    Europe. Each of our segments has its own administrative, buying
    and merchandising organization and distribution network. Of our

U.S.-based

stores, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, referred to as Marmaxx, are
    managed together and reported as a single segment, and A.J.
    Wright and HomeGoods each is reported as a separate segment.
    Outside the U.S., our chains in Canada are managed together and
    our chains in Europe are managed together. Thus, Canada is
    reported as a segment and Europe is reported as a segment. More
    detailed information about our segments, including financial
    information for each of the last three fiscal years, can be
    found in Note P to the consolidated financial statements.

Competition

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly
    competitive. We compete on the basis of fashion, quality, price,
    value, merchandise selection and freshness, brand name
    recognition, service, reputation and store location. We compete
    with local, regional, national and international department,
    specialty, off-price, discount, warehouse and outlet stores as
    well as other retailers that sell apparel, home fashions and
    other merchandise that we sell, whether in stores, through
    catalogues or media or over the internet.

Employees

At January 31, 2009, we had approximately
    133,000 employees, many of whom work less than
    40 hours per week. In addition, we hire temporary employees
    during the peak back-to-school and holiday seasons.

Trademarks

We have the right to use our principal trademarks and service
    marks, which are T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners,
    HomeSense, T.K. Maxx and A.J. Wright, in relevant countries. Our
    rights in these trademarks and service marks endure for as long
    as they are used.

Seasonality

Our business is subject to seasonal influences. In the second
    half of the year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday
    seasons, we generally realize higher levels of sales and income.

Sale of
    Bob’s Stores

In fiscal 2009, we sold Bob’s Stores, a value-oriented,
    branded apparel chain we acquired in fiscal 2004. The loss on
    the sale and historical results of operations have been
    accounted for as discontinued operations.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The statements in this Section describe the major risks to our
    business and should be considered carefully, in connection with
    all of the other information set forth in this annual report on

Form 10-K.

The risks that follow, individually or in the aggregate, are
    those that we think could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking
    statements.

The
    adverse changes in global economic conditions and in financial
    and credit markets have adversely affected and could continue to
    adversely affect our financial performance.

As widely reported, economies worldwide are in crisis, and
    global financial markets have been experiencing extreme
    volatility, disruption and credit contraction. The current
    volatility and disruption to the capital markets have reached
    unprecedented levels and have significantly adversely impacted
    global economic conditions and may continue to do so, resulting
    in additional significant recessionary pressures and declines in
    employment levels, disposable income and actual and perceived
    wealth. Adverse economic conditions continue to affect consumer
    confidence and discretionary consumer spending and have
    adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our
    sales, cash flows and results of operations. Additionally,
    adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets could
    adversely affect our costs of capital and the sources of
    liquidity available to us and have increased and could in the
    future increase our pension funding requirements. Finally, the
    effects and consequences of the current global economic crisis
    may not yet be known, which could potentially have a material
    adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, or
    otherwise negatively affect our business and financial results.

Fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues
    and earnings.

In addition to our U.S. businesses, we operate stores in
    Canada, the U.K., Ireland and Germany. Sales made by our stores
    outside the United States are denominated in the currency of the
    country in which the store is located, and changes in foreign
    exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings
    of these businesses into U.S. dollars for financial
    reporting purposes. Because of this, movements in exchange rates
    have had and are expected to continue to have a significant
    impact on our net sales and earnings.

Additionally, we routinely enter into inventory-related hedging
    instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange on
    merchandise margins of merchandise purchased by our
    international segments that is denominated in currencies other
    than their local currencies. In accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, we evaluate the fair value of
    these hedging instruments and make mark-to-market adjustments at
    the end of an accounting period. These adjustments are of a much
    greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in
    currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our
    earnings.



In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates can increase the
    cost of inventory purchases by one of our businesses that are
    denominated in a currency other than the local currency of that
    business. When these changes occur suddenly, it can be difficult
    for us to adjust retail prices accordingly, and gross margin can
    be adversely affected. We expect that such changes may
    materially affect the gross margins of our Canada segment.

Although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk
    management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in
    earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign
    exchange rates, we expect that foreign currency fluctuations
    could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and
    results of operations.

Failure
    to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory management
    could adversely affect our business.

We purchase the majority of our inventory opportunistically with
    our buyers purchasing close to need. To drive traffic to the
    stores and to increase same store sales, the treasure hunt
    nature of the off-price buying experience requires continued
    replenishment of fresh, high quality, attractively priced
    merchandise in our stores. While opportunistic buying enables
    our buyers to buy at opportune times and prices, in the
    quantities we need and into market trends, it places
    considerable discretion in our buyers, subjecting us to risks on
    the timing, pricing, quantity and nature of inventory flowing to
    the stores. In addition, we base our purchases of inventory, in
    part, on sales forecasts. If our sales forecasts do not match
    customer demand, we may experience higher inventory levels and
    decreased profit margins if we have excess or slow-moving
    inventory, or we may have insufficient inventory to meet
    customer demand, either of which could adversely affect our
    financial performance. In addition to acquiring inventory, we
    must properly execute our inventory management strategies
    through effectively allocating merchandise among our stores,
    timely and efficiently distributing inventory to stores,
    maintaining an appropriate mix and level of inventory in stores,
    appropriately changing the allocation of floor space of stores
    among product categories to respond to customer demand and
    effectively managing pricing and markdowns. Failure to execute
    our opportunistic inventory buying and inventory management well
    could adversely affect our performance and our relationship with
    our customers.

Failure
    to continue to expand our operations successfully could
    adversely affect our financial results.

We have steadily expanded the number of concepts and stores we
    operate. Our revenue growth is dependent, among other things,
    upon our ability to continue to expand successfully through new
    store openings as well as our ability to increase same store
    sales. Successful store growth requires acquisition and
    development of appropriate real estate including selection of
    store locations in appropriate geographies, availability of
    attractive stores or store sites in such locations and
    negotiation of acceptable terms. Competition for desirable
    sites, increases in real estate, construction and development
    costs and availability and costs of capital could limit our
    ability to open new stores in desirable locations in the future
    or adversely affect the economics of new stores. When we open
    stores in new markets, we may encounter difficulties in
    attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with
    our brand, our lack of familiarity with local customer
    preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. New stores
    may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing
    stores and may be adversely affected by the sales and
    profitability of existing stores in their market areas. Further,
    expansion places significant demands on the administrative,
    merchandising, store operations, distribution and other
    organizations in our businesses to manage rapid growth, and we
    may not do so successfully.

Failure
    to successfully identify customer trends and preferences to meet
    customer demand could negatively impact our
    performance.

Because our success depends on our ability to meet customer
    demand, we take various steps to keep up with consumer trends
    and preferences including contacts with vendors, monitoring
    product category and fashion trends and comparison shopping and
    actively monitoring fashion trends. Our opportunistic buying
    model allows us to buy close to need and in response to consumer
    preferences and trends. However, identifying consumer trends and
    preferences and successfully meeting customer demand is
    challenging, and these steps and our off-price buying may be
    insufficient to do so, which could adversely affect our results.



Our
    quarterly operating results can be subject to significant
    fluctuations and may fall short of either a prior quarter or
    investors’ expectations.

Our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at
    points in the past, and they may continue to do so in the
    future. Our earnings may not continue to grow at rates similar
    to the growth rates achieved in recent years and may fall short
    of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations. If we
    fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or
    investors, our share price may decline. Factors that could cause
    us not to meet analysts’ earnings expectations include some
    factors that are within our control, such as the execution of
    our off-price buying; selection, pricing and mix of merchandise;
    and inventory management including flow, markon and markdowns;
    and some factors that are not within our control, including
    actions of competitors, weather conditions, economic conditions
    and consumer confidence, and seasonality. In addition, if we do
    not repurchase the number of shares we contemplate pursuant to
    our stock repurchase program, our earnings per share may be
    adversely affected. Most of our operating expenses, such as rent
    expense and associate salaries, do not vary directly with the
    amount of sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term.
    As a result, if sales in a particular quarter are below
    expectations for that quarter, we may not proportionately reduce
    operating expenses for that quarter, and therefore such a sales
    shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our net income
    for the quarter. We maintain a forecasting process that seeks to
    project sales and align expenses. If we do not correctly
    forecast sales or appropriately adjust to actual results, our
    financial performance could be adversely affected.

Our
    future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to
    expand within our existing markets and to extend our off-price
    model in new product lines, chains and geographic
    regions.

Our strategy is to continue to expand within existing markets
    and to expand to new markets and geographies. This growth
    strategy includes developing new ways to sell more or different
    merchandise within our existing stores, continued expansion of
    our existing chains in our existing markets and countries,
    expansion of these chains to new markets and countries, and
    development and opening of new chains, all of which entail
    significant risk. Our growth is dependent upon our ability to
    successfully extend our off-price retail apparel and home
    fashions concepts in these ways. Unsuccessful extension of our
    model could adversely affect future growth or financial
    performance.

Failure
    to implement our marketing, advertising and promotional programs
    successfully, or if our competitors are more effective with
    their programs than we are, may adversely affect our
    revenue.

We use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to
    attract customers to our stores. We use various media for these
    programs, including print, television, database marketing and
    direct marketing. Some of our competitors may have substantially
    larger expenditures for their programs, which may provide them
    with a competitive advantage. There can be no assurance that we
    will be able to continue to effectively execute our marketing,
    advertising and promotional programs, and any failure to do so
    could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results
    of operations.

Our
    actual losses arising from the Computer Intrusion could exceed
    our reserve for our estimated probable losses, and our
    reputation and business could be materially harmed as a result
    of any future data breach.

We suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions (such
    intrusion or intrusions, collectively, the “Computer
    Intrusion”) into portions of our computer system that
    process and store information related to customer transactions,
    which was discovered late in fiscal 2007 and in which we believe
    that customer data were stolen. As a result we faced and
    continue to face litigation, claims and investigations. We have
    recorded a reserve that reflects our estimation of probable
    losses arising from the Computer Intrusion in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. While this reserve
    represents our best estimation of total, potential cash
    liabilities from litigation, proceedings, investigations and
    other claims, as well as legal and other costs and expenses,
    arising from the Computer Intrusion, there is no assurance that
    our actual losses will not be greater.

Since discovering the Computer Intrusion, we have taken steps
    designed to further strengthen the security of our computer
    system and protocols and have instituted an ongoing program with
    respect to data security. Nevertheless, there can be no
    assurance that we will not suffer a future data compromise. We
    rely on commercially available systems,



software, tools and monitoring to provide security for
    processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer
    information, such as payment card and personal information.
    Further, the systems currently used for transmission and
    approval of payment card transactions, and the technology
    utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put
    payment card data at risk, are determined and controlled by the
    payment card industry, not by us. Improper activities by third
    parties, advances in computer and software capabilities and
    encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other
    events or developments may facilitate or result in a further
    compromise or breach of our computer system. Any such further
    compromises or breaches could cause interruptions in our
    operations, damage to our reputation and customers’
    willingness to shop in our stores, violation of applicable laws,
    regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to additional
    costs and liabilities which could be material.

Our
    business is subject to seasonal influences and a decrease in
    sales or margins during the second half of the year could
    adversely affect our operating results.

Our business is subject to seasonal influences; we generally
    realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of
    the year, which includes the back-to-school and year-end holiday
    seasons. Any decrease in sales or margins during this period
    could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our financial
    condition and results of operations.

We
    experience risks associated with our substantial size and
    scale.

We operate seven retail concepts in several countries. Some
    aspects of the businesses and operations of the concepts are
    conducted with relative autonomy. The large size of our
    operations, our multiple businesses and the autonomy afforded to
    the concepts increase the risk that systems and practices will
    not be implemented uniformly throughout our company and that
    information will not be appropriately shared across different
    concepts and countries.

Unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate
    or our distribution centers are located could adversely affect
    our operating results.

Adverse and unseasonable weather affects customers’
    willingness to shop and their demand for the merchandise in our
    stores. Frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms,
    severe cold or heat or extended periods of unseasonable
    temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our sales and
    increase markdowns. In addition, natural disasters such as
    hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and earthquakes could severely
    damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution
    facilities located in the affected areas or result in the
    suspension of business in the affected areas or in areas served
    by the affected distribution center, thereby disrupting our
    business operations.

We
    operate in highly competitive markets, and we may not be able to
    compete effectively.

The retail business is highly competitive. We compete with many
    other local, regional, national and international retailers that
    sell apparel, home fashions and other merchandise that we sell,
    whether in stores, through catalogs or media or over the
    internet. We compete on the basis of quality, price, value,
    merchandise selection and freshness, brand name recognition,
    service, reputation and store location. Other competitive
    factors that influence the demand for the merchandise we sell
    include our advertising, marketing and promotional activities
    and the name recognition and reputation of our chains. If we
    fail to compete effectively, our sales and results of operations
    could be adversely affected.

Failure
    to attract and retain quality sales, distribution center and
    other associates in appropriate numbers as well as experienced
    buying and management personnel could adversely affect our
    performance.

Our performance depends on recruiting, developing, training and
    retaining quality sales, distribution center and other
    associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and
    management personnel. Many of our associates are in entry level
    or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover.
    The nature of the workforce in the retail industry subjects us
    to the risk of immigration law violations, which risk has
    increased in recent years. Our ability to meet our labor needs
    while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors
    such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage
    legislation, changing demographics, health and other insurance
    costs and governmental labor and employment requirements. In the
    event of increasing wage rates, if we fail to increase our wages
    competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline,
    causing our customer service to suffer, while increasing our
    wages could cause our earnings to decrease. In addition, certain
    associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and
    therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions. Because of
    the distinctive nature of our off-price model,



we must do significant internal training and development for a
    substantial number of our associates. The market for retail
    management is highly competitive and, in common with other
    retailers, we face challenges in securing sufficient management
    talent. Changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and
    retain quality associates and management personnel could
    adversely affect our performance.

If we
    engage in mergers or acquisitions of new businesses, or divest
    any of our current businesses, our business will be subject to
    additional risks.

We have grown our business in part through mergers and
    acquisitions. We may consider opportunities to acquire new
    businesses or to divest current businesses. Acquisition or
    divestiture activities may divert attention of management from
    operating the existing businesses. We may do a less-than-optimal
    job of evaluating target companies and their risks and benefits,
    and integration of acquisitions can be difficult and
    time-consuming. Acquisitions may not meet our expectations or
    may expose us to unexpected or greater-than-expected
    liabilities. Divestiture also involves risks, such as the risks
    of exposure on lease obligations, obligations undertaken in the
    disposition and potential liabilities that may arise under law
    as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of the
    acquirer. Failure to execute on mergers or divestitures in a
    satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of
    operations and financial condition.

Failure
    to operate information systems and implement new technologies
    effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or
    profitability.

The efficient operation of our business depends on our
    information systems, including our ability to operate them
    effectively and to successfully select and implement new
    technologies, systems, controls and adequate disaster recovery
    systems. We must operate and implement these systems and
    technologies such that we protect the confidentiality of data of
    our Company, our associates, our customers and other third
    parties. The failure of our information systems to perform as
    designed or our failure to implement and operate them
    effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to
    liability and thereby harm our profitability.

We
    depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to support new
    capital expansion, operations, debt repayment, stock repurchase
    program and dividends.

Our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash
    flows and upon the availability of financing sources to support
    our capital expansion requirements, general operating
    activities, stock repurchase program and dividends and to fund
    debt repayment. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient
    cash flows to support these activities or the lack of
    availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate
    terms could adversely affect our financial performance or our
    earnings per share growth.

General
    economic and other factors adversely affect consumer spending,
    which could adversely affect our sales and operating
    results.

Interest rates; recession; inflation; deflation; consumer credit
    availability; consumer debt levels; energy costs; tax rates and
    policy; unemployment trends; threats or possibilities of war,
    terrorism or other global or national unrest; actual or
    threatened epidemics; political or financial instability; and
    general economic, political and other factors beyond our control
    have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending.
    Consumer spending, in turn, affects sales at retailers, which
    could include TJX. These factors could adversely affect our
    sales and performance if we do not successfully implement
    strategies to mitigate them.

Issues
    with merchandise quality or safety could damage our reputation,
    sales or financial results.

Various governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety
    of the merchandise we sell in our stores. Regulations and
    standards in this area, including those related to the recently
    enacted Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 in the
    United States, may change from time to time. Our inability to
    comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements could
    result in significant fines or penalties, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial results. Issues with
    the quality and safety of merchandise we sell in our stores,
    regardless of our fault, or customer concerns about such issues,
    could cause damage to our reputation, lost sales, uninsured
    product liability claims or losses, merchandise recalls and
    increased costs, and regulatory, civil or criminal fines or
    penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial results.



We are
    subject to import risks associated with importing merchandise
    from abroad.

Many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our
    vendors and to a limited extent by us in many foreign countries.
    As a result, we are subject to the various risks of doing
    business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from
    abroad, such as:

—

potential disruptions in supply;

—

changes in duties, tariffs, quotas and voluntary export
    restrictions on imported merchandise;

—

strikes and other events affecting delivery;

—

consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise,
    particularly merchandise imported from the People’s
    Republic of China; and

—

economic, political or other problems in countries from or
    through which merchandise is imported.

Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs,
    currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other
    factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise
    could affect the availability and the price of our inventory.

Our
    expanding international operations expose us to risks inherent
    in foreign operations.

We have a significant retail presence in Canada, the United
    Kingdom and Ireland, and have recently expanded into Germany.
    Our goal is to continue to expand into other international
    markets in the future. Our foreign operations encounter risks
    similar to those faced by our U.S. operations, as well as
    risks inherent in foreign operations, such as understanding the
    retail climate and trends, local customs and competitive
    conditions in foreign markets, complying with foreign laws,
    rules and regulations, and foreign currency fluctuations, which
    could have an adverse impact on our profitability.

Our
    results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price
    of oil.

Prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past. These
    fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation
    costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and
    costs to purchase our products from suppliers. A continued rise
    in oil prices could adversely affect consumer spending and
    demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both
    of which could have an adverse effect on our performance.

Changes
    in laws and regulations and outcomes of litigation and
    proceedings could negatively affect our business operations and
    financial performance.

We are subject to federal, state, provincial or local laws,
    rules and regulations in the United States and abroad, any of
    which may change from time to time in ways which could
    materially adversely affect our operations and our financial
    results and condition. We are from time to time involved in
    litigation and proceedings, the outcomes of which if determined
    adversely to us could materially adversely affect our operations
    and our financial results and condition. In addition,
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in accordance
    with which we prepare our financial statements may change from
    time to time, and these changes could have material effects on
    our reported financial results and condition.

We own
    and lease for long periods significant amounts of real estate,
    which subjects us to various financial risks.

We lease virtually all of our store locations generally for long
    terms and either own or lease for long periods our primary
    distribution centers and administrative offices. Accordingly, we
    are subject to the risks associated with owning and leasing real
    estate. While we have the right to terminate some of our leases
    under specified conditions by making specified payments, we may
    not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would
    like to do so. If an existing or future store is not profitable,
    and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform
    obligations under the applicable lease, including, among other
    things, paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of
    the lease term, or exercising rights to terminate, and the
    performance of any of these obligations may be expensive. When
    we assign or sublease leased property, we can remain liable on
    the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not
    perform. In



addition, when leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate
    renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all,
    which could cause us to close stores.

Our
    stock price may fluctuate based on market
    expectations.

The public trading of our stock is based in large part on market
    expectations that our business will continue to grow and that we
    will achieve certain levels of net income. If the securities
    analysts that regularly follow our stock lower their rating or
    lower their projections for future growth and financial
    performance, the market price of our stock is likely to drop. In
    addition, if our quarterly financial performance does not meet
    the expectations of securities analysts, our stock price would
    likely decline. The decrease in the stock price may be
    disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance.

ITEM 3. LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

Putative class actions consolidated in the United States
    District Court for the District of Massachusetts,

In re TJX
    Companies Retail Security Breach Litigation

, 07-cv-10162,
    were filed against TJX (i) putatively on behalf of
    customers in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada whose
    transaction data were allegedly compromised by the Computer
    Intrusion (“Customer Track”)and (ii) putatively
    on behalf of financial institutions that received alerts from
    MasterCard or Visa related to the Computer Intrusion identifying
    payment cards issued by such financial institutions and that
    thereafter suffered damages from actual reissuance costs,
    monitoring expenses or fraud loss (“Financial Institutions
    Track”). These putative class actions asserted claims for
    negligence and related common-law

and/or

statutory causes of action stemming from the Computer Intrusion,
    and sought various forms of relief including damages, related
    injunctive or equitable remedies, multiple or punitive damages,
    and attorneys’ fees.

•

Customer Track.

On December 30, 2008, the
    District Court judgment in the Customer Track approving the
    Amended Settlement Agreement, dated as of November 14,
    2007, among TJX, its acquiring bank and the named plaintiffs,
    individually and on behalf of the settlement class, became final.

•

Financial Institutions Track.

On
    October 12, 2007, the District Court dismissed the
    plaintiffs’ claims in the Financial Institutions Track,
    other than their claims of negligent misrepresentation and
    violation of the Massachusetts consumer protection statute
    (Chapter 93A) based on negligent misrepresentation, and denied
    the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification of the
    non-dismissed claims. Subsequently, the District Court dismissed
    the Financial Institutions Track of the action for lack of
    subject matter jurisdiction and ordered the case transferred to
    state court in Massachusetts. On March 30, 2009, the United
    States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the
    dismissal of the plaintiffs’ claims for negligence and
    breach of contract, affirmed the denial of the plaintiffs’
    motion for leave to amend their complaint to add a count for
    conversion, and vacated the order transferring the case to state
    court in Massachusetts. The First Circuit further upheld the
    decision not to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims for negligent
    misrepresentation and for violation of Chapter 93A based on
    negligent misrepresentation (but in so doing noted that the
    plaintiffs had not appealed from the lower court’s denial
    of class certification of such claims) and reversed the
    dismissal of the plaintiffs’ claim for breach of
    Chapter 93A based on an unfairness theory. Finally, the
    First Circuit remanded to the District Court for further
    proceedings on those claims that the First Circuit ruled were
    not subject to dismissal, noting that during such further
    proceedings TJX will have an opportunity to move for summary
    judgment on all such claims and to challenge class certification
    of the plaintiffs’ claim for breach of Chapter 93A
    based on an unfairness theory.

Those financial institutions that (for themselves and, in the
    case of MasterCard issuers, on behalf of their affiliated and
    their sponsored issuers) accepted the settlement offer under the
    Settlement Agreement among TJX, Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa Inc.
    and TJX’s acquiring bank dated as of November 29, 2007
    or the Settlement Agreement between TJX and MasterCard
    International Incorporated dated as of April 2, 2008,
    released and indemnified TJX and its acquiring banks with
    respect to any claims of such issuers as Visa issuers or
    MasterCard issuers, respectively, with respect to any claims by
    reason of any matter, occurrence, or event pertaining to the
    Computer Intrusion, including but not limited to claims in the
    Financial Institution Track and state court case described
    below. In addition, the named plaintiffs in the Financial
    Institutions Track other than AmeriFirst Bank previously settled
    with TJX.

On January 16, 2008, AmeriFirstBank and an additional
    plaintiff filed an action in Massachusetts state court,

AmeriFirstBank et al. v. The TJX Companies, Inc. et
    al

, Massachusetts Superior Court

08-0229,

raising allegations and claims nearly identical to those
    asserted in the Financial Institutions Track of the purported
    federal class action. The complaint stated plaintiffs’
    intention to bring class allegations depending on pre-trial
    rulings by the state court. The state court stayed the state
    action pending adjudication by the federal court of the appeals
    in the Financial Institutions Track. On March 30, 2009, the
    First Circuit issued the opinion described above on those
    appeals.



A multi-state group of 41 state Attorneys General is
    investigating whether TJX may have violated their respective
    state consumer protection laws with respect to the Computer
    Intrusion. TJX has responded to Civil Investigative Demands with
    respect to this investigation.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The discussion that follows relates to our 53-week fiscal year
    ended January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), and the fiscal years
    ended January 26, 2008 (fiscal 2008) and
    January 27, 2007 (fiscal 2007), each of which included
    52 weeks.

Our results reflect two discontinued operations: Bob’s
    Stores, sold in fiscal 2009 and 34 A.J. Wright stores closed in
    fiscal 2007 as part of a repositioning of the chain. See
    Note C to the consolidated financial statements. All
    references in the following discussion are to continuing
    operations unless otherwise indicated.

Our results reflect the costs of the unauthorized intrusion or
    intrusions (collectively, the “Computer Intrusion”)
    into portions of our computer system, which was discovered in
    late fiscal 2007 and in which we believe customer data were
    stolen. See “Provision for Computer Intrusion related
    costs” below.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Our fiscal 2009 performance was adversely affected in the second
    half of the year by two macroeconomic factors: the worldwide
    recession which adversely affected consumer spending and retail
    sales at TJX and generally and the significant strengthening of
    the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar and the British
    pound, which adversely affected the translation of the operating
    results of our Canadian and European businesses. With the
    flexibility of our off-price business model, in fiscal 2009 we
    increased our inventory turns and maintained the value
    proposition of our merchandise by buying closer to need and
    operating with leaner-than-usual inventories. We also continued
    a focus on tight expense control during fiscal 2009. Despite the
    challenging environment, customer traffic in fiscal 2009 was up
    across virtually all of our divisions, and merchandise margins
    remained strong. Highlights of our financial performance for
    fiscal 2009 include the following:

—

Net sales for fiscal 2009 were $19.0 billion, a 4% increase
    over fiscal 2008. The 53rd week in fiscal 2009 increased
    net sales by approximately 1%, which was more than offset by a
    2% decline in net sales due to the impact of foreign currency
    exchange rates. We continued to grow our business, with both
    stores in operation and selling square footage up 5% at the end
    of fiscal 2009 compared to last fiscal year end.

—

Same store sales on a 52-week basis for fiscal 2009 increased 1%
    over the prior year.

—

Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2009 increased
    0.3 percentage points, as an increase in merchandise
    margins and the benefit of the

rd

week

    were more than offset by buying and occupancy expense deleverage
    on a 1% same store sales increase. Selling, general and
    administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal
    2009 increased by 0.1 percentage points compared to the
    prior year, primarily due to deleverage on the 1% same store
    sales increase.

—

Our fiscal 2009 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to
    net sales) was 7.6% compared to 6.9% for fiscal 2008. The
    comparison of pre-tax margins for fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008 was
    affected by the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs
    in each year. Fiscal 2009 included a $31 million credit
    (pre-tax) to the provision, which increased pre-tax margin by
    0.2 percentage points, while fiscal 2008 included a pre-tax
    charge of $197 million, which reduced the fiscal 2008
    pre-tax margin by 1.1 percentage points.

—

Income from continuing operations was $914.9 million, or
    $2.08 per diluted share, for fiscal 2009 compared to
    $782.4 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, last year. The
    fiscal 2009 credit to the Provision for Computer Intrusion
    related costs increased fiscal 2009 income from continuing
    operations by $18 million, or $0.04 per diluted share,
    while the fiscal 2008 charge for the Provision for Computer
    Intrusion related costs reduced fiscal 2008 income from
    continuing operations by $119 million, or $0.25 per diluted
    share.

—

During fiscal 2009, we repurchased 24.0 million shares of
    our common stock at a cost of $741 million. Our diluted
    earnings per share reflect the benefit of our stock repurchase
    program.

—

Consolidated average per store inventories of our continuing
    operations, including inventory on hand at our distribution
    centers, were down 6% at the end of fiscal 2009 as compared to
    an increase of 2% at the prior year



end. On a comparable basis, adjusting for currency and a
    calendar shift due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2009, average
    per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our
    distribution centers, were down 4% in fiscal 2009 as compared to
    fiscal 2008 and were essentially flat in fiscal 2008 as compared
    to fiscal 2007.

We have implemented steps to position ourselves for the fiscal
    year ending January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010) in light of
    the ongoing worldwide recession including:

—

We have planned our consolidated same store sales
    conservatively, setting our inventory and expense plans around
    negative low single digit comparable store sales.

—

We plan to continue to operate with historically lean
    inventories and to buy closer to need than in the past, designed
    to increase inventory turns and drive traffic to our stores.

—

We are taking measures designed to reduce expenses in fiscal
    2010 by up to $150 million including further savings in
    non-merchandise procurement, implementing processes to more
    efficiently manage payroll in our store and distribution
    centers, reducing marketing expenditures while increasing
    penetration, eliminating open positions, eliminating merit pay
    increases across the majority of the organization, restructuring
    certain areas to improve productivity and efficiency and
    offering a voluntary retirement program for certain employees.

The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating
    results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating
    results.

Net sales:

Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009
    totaled $19.0 billion, a 4% increase over net sales of
    $18.3 billion in fiscal 2008. The increase reflected a 4%
    increase from new stores, a 1% increase from the 53rd week
    and a 1% increase in same store sales, offset by a 2% decline
    from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
    Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2008 increased 7% over net
    sales of $17.1 billion for fiscal 2007. The increase
    reflected increases of 3% from new stores, 2% from same store
    sales and a 2% favorable impact due to foreign currency exchange
    rates.

New stores have been a significant source of sales growth. Both
    our consolidated store count and our selling square footage
    increased by 5% in fiscal 2009 and by 4% in fiscal 2008 over the
    respective prior year periods. As a result of economic
    conditions, we have planned store openings more conservatively
    and expect to add 64 stores (net of store closings) in fiscal
    2010, a 2% increase in our consolidated store base and an
    increase of 2% in our selling square footage.

The 1% same store sales increase in fiscal 2009 reflected a
    strong first half performance, especially at our international
    segments, partially offset by same store sales decreases in the
    second half of the year largely due to the economic recession.
    Customer traffic increased at virtually all of our businesses in
    fiscal 2009, even in the third and fourth quarters, which was
    partially offset by a reduction in the value of the average
    transaction. As for merchandise categories, shoes, accessories
    and dresses were the strongest performers, while home fashions
    were adversely affected by the weak housing market and economic
    conditions. Geographically, same store sales in Canada and the
    United Kingdom were above the consolidated average for fiscal
    2009, while in the U.S., same store sales in the West Coast and
    Florida trailed the consolidated average.

The 2% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2008 was driven
    by a strong performance at our international segments. In the
    U.S., sales of dresses, footwear and accessories were strong,
    partially offset by softer sales in the balance of the
    women’s apparel category. At Marmaxx, our largest business,
    home categories were also weak. Same store sales increases
    benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments
    in Marshalls. During fiscal 2008, we opened expanded footwear
    departments in approximately 240 additional Marshalls stores.
    Same store sales for fiscal 2008 at our international segments
    were above the consolidated average. Within the U. S., the
    strongest regions were the West Coast and the Northeast, while
    Florida and the Southeast trailed the U.S. average. Overall
    transaction volume was slightly down in fiscal 2008, more than
    offset by an increase in the value of the average transaction.

We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have
    been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal
    years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third
    fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store
    until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which
    stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the
    beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains
    constant throughout that year, unless a store is



closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the
    current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely
    aligned. Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size
    are generally classified in the same way as the original store,
    and we believe that the impact of these stores on the
    consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store
    sales of our foreign divisions are calculated on a constant
    currency basis, which removes the effect of changes in currency
    exchange rates, and we believe it is a more accurate measure of
    the divisional operating performance.

    results as a percentage of net sales:

Impact of foreign currency exchange rates:

Our
    operating results can be adversely affected by foreign currency
    exchange rates as a result of significant changes in the value
    of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two of
    the more significant ways in which foreign currency impacts us
    are as follows:

Translation of foreign operating results into
    U.S. dollars:

In our financial statements, we translate
    the operations of our stores in Canada and Europe from local
    currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect
    at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign
    exchange rates from comparable prior periods can result in
    meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, income from
    continuing operations and earnings per share growth as well as
    the net sales and operating results of our Canadian and European
    segments. Currency translation generally does not affect
    operating margins, as sales and expenses of the foreign
    operations are translated at essentially the same rates each
    period.

Inventory hedges:

Additionally, we routinely enter into
    inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of
    foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our
    international divisions purchase goods in currencies that are
    not their local currencies, primarily U.S. dollar
    purchases. As we have not elected “hedge accounting”
    as defined by SFAS No. 133 (“Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”), under generally
    accepted accounting principles we record a mark-to-market
    adjustment on the hedging instruments in our results of
    operations at the end of each reporting period, prior to the
    currency gain or loss being recorded on the items being hedged.
    In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the hedges
    are effectively offset when the related inventory is sold. While
    these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much
    greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes
    in currency exchange rates, as there were in the third and
    fourth quarters of fiscal 2009. Historically, the impact on a
    full-year basis has not been material. Since the mark-to-market
    adjustment on these hedges has no impact on net sales, it
    affects both our operating margins and earnings growth.

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy
    costs:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy
    costs, as a percentage of net sales was 75.8% in fiscal 2009,
    75.5% in fiscal 2008 and 75.8% in fiscal 2007. This ratio for
    fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, increased
    0.3 percentage points primarily due to deleverage of buying
    and occupancy costs on the 1% same store sales increase. This
    deleverage more than offset a benefit to this expense ratio due
    to the 53rd week (estimated at approximately
    0.2 percentage points) as well as an improvement in our
    consolidated merchandise margin of 0.2 percentage points.
    Throughout fiscal 2009, we solidly executed our off-price
    fundamentals, buying close to need, operating with leaner
    inventories and taking advantage of opportunities in the market
    place.

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a
    percentage of net sales for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal
    2007, reflected an improvement in our consolidated merchandise
    margin (0.4 percentage points), due to improved markon and
    lower markdowns. Throughout fiscal 2008, we solidly executed our
    off-price fundamentals, buying close to need and taking
    advantage of opportunities in the market place. This merchandise
    margin improvement was



partially offset by a slight increase in occupancy costs as a
    percentage of net sales. All other buying and occupancy costs
    remained relatively flat as compared to the same period in the
    prior year.

Selling, general and administrative expenses:

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
    net sales were 16.7% in fiscal 2009, 16.6% in fiscal 2008 and
    16.7% in fiscal 2007. The increase in fiscal 2009 compared to
    fiscal 2008 reflects deleverage from the low same store sales
    increase, primarily in store payroll and field costs, partially
    offset by savings from cost containment initiatives. Advertising
    costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 were
    essentially flat to the prior year.

The fiscal 2008 expense ratio was slightly down compared to the
    prior year with a planned increase in advertising costs
    (0.1 percentage point) being offset by cost containment
    initiatives.

Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs:

From the time of the discovery of the Computer Intrusion late in
    fiscal 2007, through the end of fiscal 2009, we cumulatively
    expensed $171.5 million (pre-tax) with respect to the
    Computer Intrusion, including a net charge of
    $159.2 million in fiscal 2008 to reserve for probable
    losses, costs of $42.8 million incurred prior to
    establishment of the reserve ($5 million of which was
    recorded in fiscal 2007) and a $30.5 million reduction
    in the reserve in fiscal 2009 as a result of negotiations,
    settlements, insurance proceeds and adjustments in our estimated
    losses. Costs relating to the Computer Intrusion incurred and
    paid after establishment of the reserve were charged against the
    reserve, which is included in accrued expenses and other
    liabilities on our balance sheet.

As of January 31, 2009, our reserve balance was
    $42.2 million, which reflects our current estimation of
    remaining probable losses (in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) with respect
    to the Computer Intrusion, including litigation, proceedings,
    investigations and other claims, as well as legal, monitoring,
    reporting and other costs. As an estimate, our reserve is
    subject to uncertainty, our actual costs may vary from our
    current estimate and such variations may be material. We may
    decrease or increase the amount of our reserve to adjust for
    developments in the course and resolution of litigation, claims
    and investigations and related expenses and receipt of insurance
    proceeds and for other changes.

Interest (income) expense, net:

Interest (income)
    expense, net amounted to expense of $14.3 million for
    fiscal 2009, income of $1.6 million for fiscal 2008 and
    expense of $15.6 million for fiscal 2007. The changes from
    year to year relate primarily to interest income which totaled
    $22.2 million in fiscal 2009, $40.7 million in fiscal
    2008 and $23.6 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, we
    generated more interest income due to higher cash balances
    available for investment as well as higher interest rates earned
    on our investments.

Income taxes:

Our effective annual income tax rate
    was 36.9% in fiscal 2009, 37.9% in fiscal 2008 and 37.7% in
    fiscal 2007. The decrease in the tax rate for fiscal 2009 as
    compared to fiscal 2008 reflects the favorable impact of a
    $19 million reduction in the FIN 48 tax liability,
    which reduced the annual effective income tax rate for fiscal
    2009 by 1.3 percentage points. This improvement in the
    annual income tax rate in fiscal 2009 was offset by the absence
    of a fiscal 2008 favorable tax benefit of 0.4 percentage
    points relating to the tax treatment of our Puerto Rico
    subsidiary. See Note J to the consolidated financial
    statements.

The increase in the tax rate for fiscal 2008 as compared to
    fiscal 2007 reflects the absence of some fiscal 2007 one-time
    benefits as well as an increase due to certain FIN 48 tax
    positions, partially offset by the favorable impact of increased
    income at our foreign operations and increased foreign tax
    credits relating to the tax treatment of our Puerto Rico
    subsidiary.

Income from continuing operations:

Income from
    continuing operations was $914.9 million in fiscal 2009,
    $782.4 million in fiscal 2008 and $787.2 million in
    fiscal 2007. Income from continuing operations per share was
    $2.08 in fiscal 2009, $1.68 in fiscal 2008 and $1.65 in fiscal
    2007. Unlike many companies in the retail industry, we did not
    have a

rd

week

    in fiscal 2007, but did have a

rd

week

    in fiscal 2009. We estimate the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2009 favorably affected earnings per share by $0.09
    per share.



The reduction in the Provision for Computer Intrusion related
    costs in fiscal 2009 benefited income from continuing operations
    by approximately $18 million, after-tax, or $0.04 per
    share. The charge relating to the Computer Intrusion related
    costs in fiscal 2008, adversely affected income from continuing
    operations by approximately $119 million, after tax, or
    $0.25 per share.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also affected the
    comparability of our results. Changes in currency rates reduced
    earnings per share by $0.05 per share in fiscal 2009 as compared
    to an increase of $0.01 per share in fiscal 2008. Changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates increased fiscal 2008 earnings
    per share by $0.05 per share in comparison to fiscal 2007.

In addition, our share repurchase program affects the
    comparability of earnings per share. We repurchased
    24.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of
    $741 million in fiscal 2009; we repurchased
    33.3 million shares at a cost of $950 million in
    fiscal 2008; and we repurchased 22.0 million shares at a
    cost of $557 million in fiscal 2007.

Discontinued operations and net income:

All
    historical income statements have been adjusted to reflect the
    sale of Bob’s Stores in fiscal 2009 and the closure of 34
    A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2007 as discontinued operations.
    Including the impact of discontinued operations, net income was
    $880.6 million, or $2.00 per share, for fiscal 2009,
    $771.8 million, or $1.66 per share, for fiscal 2008 and
    $738.0 million, or $1.55 per share, for fiscal 2007.

Segment information:

The following is a discussion
    of the operating results of our business segments. In the
    United States, our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are
    aggregated as the Marmaxx segment, and HomeGoods and
    A.J. Wright each is reported as a separate segment.
    TJX’s stores operated in Canada (Winners and HomeSense) are
    reported as the Canadian segment, and TJX’s stores operated
    in Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) are reported as the European
    segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on
    “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax
    income before general corporate expense, Provision for Computer
    Intrusion related costs and interest. “Segment profit or
    loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to
    similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition,
    this measure of performance should not be considered an
    alternative to net income or cash flows from operating
    activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of
    liquidity. Presented below is selected financial information
    related to our business segments:

Net sales at Marmaxx increased 3% in fiscal 2009 as compared to
    fiscal 2008. Same store sales for Marmaxx were flat in fiscal
    2009 compared to a 1% same store sales increase in fiscal 2008.

Sales at Marmaxx for fiscal 2009 reflected increased customer
    traffic offset by a decrease in the value of the average
    transaction. Categories that posted same store sales increases
    included footwear and accessories, children’s clothing and
    dresses. During fiscal 2009, we added expanded footwear
    departments to approximately 220 Marshalls stores, which nearly
    completes the expansion of footwear departments at Marshalls.
    Home categories at Marmaxx reported same



store sales decreases in fiscal 2009. Geographically in fiscal
    2009, same store sales in the Northeast, Midwest and
    Mid-Atlantic regions were above the chain average, while same
    store sales in the West Coast, Florida and the Southeast were
    below the chain average.

Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (“segment
    margin” or “segment profit margin”) decreased to
    9.3% in fiscal 2009 from 9.7% in fiscal 2008. Segment margin was
    negatively impacted by an increase in occupancy costs as a
    percentage of net sales (0.5 percentage points) due to
    deleverage on the flat same store sales. This decrease was
    partially offset by an increase in merchandise margin
    (0.1 percentage point) due to increased markon. As of
    January 31, 2009, average per store inventories, including
    inventory on hand at distribution centers, were down 4% compared
    to a 2% decrease at the prior year end. The decreases in average
    inventories were primarily due to continued focus on maintaining
    a liquid inventory position.

Segment margin for fiscal 2008 increased to 9.7% compared to
    9.4% in fiscal 2007. Segment margin was favorably impacted by
    merchandise margins, which increased 0.4 percentage points
    (as a percentage of net sales) due to lower markdowns and a
    higher markon, as well as some expense leverage due to our cost
    containment measures. These improvements in segment margin were
    partly offset by an increase in occupancy costs and a planned
    increase in advertising expense.

We expect to open approximately 17 new stores (net of closings)
    in fiscal 2010, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 1% and
    increasing its selling square footage by 1%.

Net sales for the Canadian segment for fiscal 2009 increased by
    5% over fiscal 2008. Currency exchange translation reduced
    fiscal 2009 sales by approximately $68 million. Same store
    sales increased 3% in fiscal 2009 compared to a strong increase
    of 5% in fiscal 2008. Same store sales of outerwear, footwear,
    jewelry and accessories were above the segment average, while
    HomeSense same store sales were below the segment average for
    fiscal 2009.

Segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased slightly to
    $236 million compared to $235 million in fiscal 2008,
    while segment margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to
    11.0%. Currency exchange translation reduced segment profit by
    $11 million for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008.
    However, because currency translation impacts both sales and
    expenses, it has little or no impact on segment margin. In
    addition, the mark-to-market adjustment of inventory related
    hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2009 by $1 million,
    in contrast to a $5 million benefit of the mark-to-market
    adjustment of inventory related hedges in fiscal 2008 which
    adversely impacted segment margin comparisons by
    0.3 percentage points. Segment margin for fiscal 2009,
    reflected increases in distribution center costs and store
    payroll costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by
    an increase in merchandise margins. In the third quarter of
    fiscal 2009, Winners opened 2 StyleSense stores, a new concept
    that offers family footwear and accessories. We anticipate that
    merchandise margins in the Canadian segment will also decline in
    fiscal 2010 as a result of foreign



currency exchange, due to the high volume of merchandise
    purchases by the Canadian segment denominated in
    U.S. dollars.

Segment profit margin for fiscal 2008 increased
    1.1 percentage points to 11.5% compared to 10.4% for fiscal
    2007. This improvement in segment margin was primarily due to
    improved expense ratios (leverage from the 5% same store sales
    increase as well as cost containment initiatives). Currency
    exchange rates increased segment profit by approximately
    $24 million for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007.
    Most of this increase was due to currency translation, and as a
    result, it had no impact on segment margin. The increase in
    segment profit in fiscal 2008 also included the favorable impact
    of a mark-to-market adjustment of inventory hedge contracts,
    which increased segment margin by 0.3 percentage points.
    The fiscal 2008 segment margin also reflected an increase in
    merchandise margin, primarily due to increased markon as well as
    the favorable impact of cost containment initiatives and strong
    same store sales results on expense ratios.

We expect to add a net of 13 stores in Canada in fiscal 2010,
    which is an increase of 5% and will increase selling square
    footage by 5%.

European net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 1% to
    $2.2 billion compared to fiscal 2008. Currency exchange
    rate translation negatively affected fiscal 2009 sales by
    approximately $282 million. Same store sales increased 4%
    for fiscal 2009 compared to a 6% increase last year. Same store
    sales for footwear and accessories and most other women’s
    apparel categories performed above the chain average, while home
    fashions were below the chain average.

Segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased 8% to
    $137.6 million, and segment margin increased
    0.4 percentage points to 6.1% compared to last year.
    Currency exchange rate translation negatively affected segment
    profit by approximately $26 million in fiscal 2009. The
    increase in segment margin reflects improved merchandise
    margins, partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs as a
    percentage of sales and the cost of operations in Germany. We
    are encouraged by the performance of our German stores but as
    they are new stores, they reduce the segment margin generated by
    the more established stores in the U.K. and Ireland. During
    fiscal 2009, T.K. Maxx added 4 more stores in Germany, following
    the opening of its first 5 stores in Germany in fiscal 2008.
    T.K. Maxx also introduced the HomeSense concept into the U.K.
    with 7 new stores.

Segment profit for fiscal 2008 increased 16% to
    $127.2 million, while segment margin decreased slightly to
    5.7% compared to fiscal 2007. Currency exchange rate translation
    favorably impacted segment profit by approximately
    $10 million in fiscal 2008, but did not impact the segment
    profit margin. The opening of 5 stores in Germany reduced
    segment profit for fiscal 2008 by $11 million and reduced
    the fiscal 2008 segment margin by 0.6 percentage points,
    offsetting the slightly improved merchandise margin in the
    remainder of the segment, as well as the favorable impact of
    same store sales growth on expense ratios and the segment’s
    cost containment initiatives.



In fiscal 2010, we plan to open a net of 17 T.K. Maxx stores,
    including 10 in Germany and 3 HomeSense stores in the U.K. and
    to expand selling square footage by 8%.

HomeGoods’ net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 7% compared
    to fiscal 2008, and same store sales decreased 3% in fiscal
    2009. Sales of home fashions have been particularly impacted by
    the weak housing market and recession. Segment margin of 2.7%
    was down from 5.1% for fiscal 2008. Merchandise margins declined
    in fiscal 2009, primarily due to increased markdowns. In
    addition, HomeGoods experienced deleverage on operating costs as
    a result of the decline in same store sales. We are seeking to
    address the difficult home environment by operating with very
    lean inventories and focusing on merchandise categories that we
    believe will resonate with consumers in these difficult times.

HomeGoods’ net sales for fiscal 2008 increased 8% compared
    to fiscal 2007, and same store sales increased 3% in fiscal
    2008. Segment margin of 5.1% for fiscal 2008 improved over
    fiscal 2007, primarily due to improved merchandise margins and
    the leveraging of expenses, particularly occupancy costs. These
    segment margin improvements were offset in part by an increase
    in advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales.

In fiscal 2010, we plan to add a net of 4 HomeGoods stores and
    increase selling square footage by 1%.

A.J. Wright’s net sales increased 7% for fiscal 2009
    compared to fiscal 2008, and segment profit increased to
    $2.9 million compared to a loss of $1.8 million in
    fiscal 2008. Same store sales increased 4% for fiscal 2009 and
    A.J. Wright recorded its first segment profit in fiscal
    2009 compared to losses in the prior years. We believe A.J.
    Wright has improved its results through better merchandising and
    advertising effectiveness, as a result of our improved
    understanding of A.J. Wright’s customer tastes and spending
    habits.

A.J. Wright’s net sales increased 5% for fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007. A.J. Wright’s same store sales
    increased 2% for fiscal 2008, and segment loss for fiscal 2008
    was $1.8 million compared to $10.3 million for fiscal
    2007. This improvement was primarily due to stronger merchandise
    margin, a reduction in occupancy costs as a percentage of net
    sales and the impact of cost containment initiatives.

As a result of A.J. Wright’s improved results, we plan to
    increase the rate of store openings for this chain for fiscal
    2010, currently planning to add a net of 13 A.J. Wright stores
    and increase selling square footage by 10%.

General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes is

    business segments and is included in selling, general and
    administrative expenses.

General corporate expense in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 was
    virtually flat.

The comparison of general corporate expense in fiscal 2008
    versus fiscal 2007 reflected an increase in corporate support
    costs in fiscal 2008 and a $5 million charge in fiscal 2007
    relating to the cost of a workforce reduction and other
    termination benefits at the corporate level.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Operating
    Activities:

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $1,155 million in fiscal 2009, $1,375 million in
    fiscal 2008, and $1,213 million in fiscal 2007. The cash
    generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal
    years was largely due to operating earnings.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 decreased by
    $220 million as compared to the prior year. Net income,
    after adjusting for the non-cash impact of depreciation and the
    sale of Bob’s Stores assets of $31 million in fiscal
    2009 (including the benefit of the 53rd week), provided
    cash of $1,314 million, an increase of $173 million
    from the adjusted $1,141 million in fiscal 2008. The change
    in deferred income taxes favorably impacted cash flows in fiscal
    2009 by $132 million, while last year’s deferred
    income taxes reduced cash flows by $102 million. Deferred
    taxes in fiscal 2008 reflected the non-cash tax benefit of
    $47 million relating to the establishment of the Computer
    Intrusion reserve. The favorable impact on deferred income taxes
    in fiscal 2009 reflected the tax treatment of payments against
    the Computer Intrusion reserve and favorable impact of tax
    depreciation. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the
    related change in accounts payable offset the favorable changes
    in cash flows in fiscal 2009, as it resulted in a use of cash of
    $210 million in fiscal 2009, compared to a source of cash
    of $5 million last year. The change in merchandise
    inventories and accounts payable in fiscal 2009 was primarily
    driven by a timing difference in the payment of our accounts
    payable due to change in our buying pattern. The change in
    accrued expenses and other liabilities resulted in a use of cash
    of $35 million in fiscal 2009 versus a source of cash of
    $203 million in fiscal 2008. Last year, the increase in
    accrued expenses and other liabilities reflected
    $117 million for the pre-tax reserve established for the
    Computer Intrusion, which favorably impacted cash flows, while
    fiscal 2009’s cash flows were reduced by $75 million
    for payments against and adjustments to the reserve. Changes in
    current income taxes payable/recoverable reduced cash in fiscal
    2009 by $49 million compared to an increase of
    $56 million in fiscal 2008 and the change in prepaid
    expenses reduced fiscal 2009 operating cash flows by an
    additional $65 million, primarily due to the timing of
    February rental payments.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 increased by
    $162 million over the prior year. Net income, after
    adjusting for the non-cash impact of depreciation, for fiscal
    2008 increased $50 million. The change in inventory, net of
    accounts payable, from prior year-end levels was a significant
    component of operating cash flows. In fiscal 2008, the change in
    merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts
    payable, favorably impacted operating cash flows by
    $5 million compared to a use of cash of $151 million
    in fiscal 2007. Additionally, fiscal 2008 operating cash flows
    were favorably impacted by the change in income taxes payable.
    These increases in fiscal 2008 operating cash flows as compared
    to fiscal 2007 were offset by the unfavorable cash flow impact
    of the deferred income tax provision, changes in accrued
    expenses and other liabilities and changes in accounts
    receivable.

Discontinued operations reserve:

We have a reserve
    for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates
    primarily to real estate leases associated with the closure of
    34 A.J. Wright stores as well as leases of former TJX
    businesses. In fiscal 2009, we reserved an additional
    $3 million for 2 Bob’s Stores locations, which the
    buyer of Bob’s



Stores has the right to put back to us and which we consider
    probable. This was offset by a comparable amount due to
    favorable settlements on several A.J. Wright locations. The
    balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three
    fiscal years is presented below:

We added $62 million in fiscal 2007 for the exit costs
    related to the closing of 34 A.J. Wright stores (see Note C
    to our consolidated financial statements). The additions to the
    reserve for other lease related obligations in fiscal 2007 were
    the result of periodic adjustments to the estimated lease
    obligations of our former businesses and were offset by income
    from creditor recoveries of a similar amount. The lease related
    charges against the reserve during fiscal 2007 related primarily
    to our former businesses. The fixed asset write-offs and other
    charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 and all of the
    charges against the reserve in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009,
    related primarily to the 34 A.J. Wright closed stores.

Approximately $25 million of the fiscal 2009 reserve
    balance relates to the A.J. Wright store closings, primarily our
    estimation of lease costs, net of estimated subtenant income.
    Approximately $3 million of the reserve at fiscal 2009
    relates to 2 Bob’s Stores locations which are considered
    probable for being put back to TJX by the buyer. The remainder
    of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims,
    updated quarterly, that have been, or we believe are likely to
    be, made against us for liability as an original lessee or
    guarantor of the leases of former businesses, after mitigation
    of the number and cost of these lease obligations. At
    January 31, 2009, substantially all the leases of former
    businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the
    landlords asserted liability against us had been resolved. The
    actual net cost of these lease obligations may differ from our
    original estimate. Although our actual costs with respect to the
    lease obligations of former businesses may exceed amounts
    estimated in our reserve, and we may incur costs for leases from
    these former businesses that were not terminated or had not
    expired, we do not expect to incur any material costs related to
    these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts
    estimated. We estimate that the majority of the discontinued
    operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years.
    The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how
    the remaining lease obligations are actually settled.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of
    BJ’s Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, and 8
    additional Bob’s Stores leases. Our reserve for
    discontinued operations does not reflect these leases because we
    do not believe that the likelihood of any future liability to us
    is probable.

Off-balance sheet liabilities:

We have contingent
    obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor,
    which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released
    by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous
    leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant
    number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our
    former businesses discussed above, we have rarely had a claim
    with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not
    expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We
    do not generally have sufficient information about these leases
    to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them,
    which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the
    current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related to
    one or more of these leases.



We also have contingent obligations in connection with some
    assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We
    estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our
    reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations,
    BJ’s Wholesale Club and Bob’s Stores leases discussed
    above, and properties of our discontinued operations that we
    have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their
    obligations, to be approximately $100 million as of
    January 31, 2009. We believe that most or all of these
    contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the extent
    they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to
    mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which we may be
    obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to breach of
    warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
    sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
    These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
    There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
    respect to these contingent obligations.

Investing
    Activities:

Our cash flows for investing activities include capital
    expenditures for the last three years as set forth in the table
    below:

We expect that capital expenditures will approximate
    $450 million for fiscal 2010, which we expect to fund
    through internally generated funds. This includes
    $153 million for new stores, $182 million for store
    renovations, expansions and improvements and $115 million
    for our office and distribution centers. The planned decrease in
    capital expenditures is attributable to fewer planned store
    openings and reduced spending on renovations and improvements to
    existing stores.

Investing activities also include cash flows associated with our
    net investment hedges. During fiscal 2009, we suspended our
    policy of hedging the net investment in our foreign subsidiaries
    and settled such hedges during the fourth quarter. The net cash
    received on net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 amounted to
    $14.4 million versus net cash payments of
    $13.7 million in fiscal 2008 and $17.7 million in
    fiscal 2007.

Financing
    Activities:

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash
    outflows of $769 million in fiscal 2009, $953 million
    in fiscal 2008 and $418 million in fiscal 2007. The
    majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program.

We spent $741 million in fiscal 2009, $950 million in
    fiscal 2008 and $557 million in fiscal 2007 under our stock
    repurchase programs. We repurchased 24.0 million shares in
    fiscal 2009, 33.3 million shares in fiscal 2008 and
    22.0 million shares in fiscal 2007. All shares repurchased
    were retired. We record the repurchase of our stock on a cash
    basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may
    vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our
    repurchases. Our fiscal 2009 repurchases completed the
    $1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board
    of Directors in January 2007 and included the repurchase of
    8.9 million shares at a cost of $255 million under the
    $1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board
    of Directors in February 2008. As of January 31, 2009,
    $745 million remained available for purchase under the
    current program. The timing of purchases under this program is
    determined by TJX from time to time based on its assessment of
    various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity and market
    conditions. We are taking a more conservative approach to our
    stock repurchase program and currently plan to repurchase up to
    approximately $250 million of our stock in fiscal 2010.
    This timing and amount of these purchases are subject to change
    depending upon the economic environment and other factors.

The $464.9 million aggregate principal amount outstanding
    of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes (which are due
    in February 2021) are convertible into 15.2 million
    shares of common stock under certain conditions,



including if the closing sale price of our common stock reaches
    specified trigger prices. The trigger price was met during a
    portion of fiscal 2009 and 52,552 notes were converted during
    fiscal 2009, resulting in the issuance of 1.7 million
    shares of common stock. The notes were not convertible during
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 because our stock price did
    not meet the trigger prices during relevant periods. The trigger
    prices will have to be met during applicable future periods for
    the notes to be convertible in future quarters.

We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which
    totaled $0.44 per share in fiscal 2009, $0.36 per share in
    fiscal 2008 and $0.28 per share in fiscal 2007. Cash payments
    for dividends on our common stock totaled $177 million in
    fiscal 2009, $151 million in fiscal 2008 and
    $123 million in fiscal 2007. Financing activities also
    included proceeds of $142 million in fiscal 2009,
    $134 million in fiscal 2008 and $260 million in fiscal
    2007 from the exercise of employee stock options.

We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise
    requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term
    bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper.
    We have a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing
    in May 2010 and a $500 million revolving credit facility
    maturing in May 2011. These agreements have no compensating
    balance requirements and have various covenants including a
    requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. These
    agreements serve as backup to our commercial paper program. As
    of January 31, 2009 there were no outstanding amounts under
    our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our
    U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was
    $222 million during fiscal 2009. The weighted average
    interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was 3.92%
    in fiscal 2009. There were no borrowings on our credit
    facilities during fiscal 2008.

As of January 31, 2009 and January 26, 2008, Winners
    had two credit lines, one for C$10 million for operating
    expenses and one C$10 million letter of credit facility.
    Winners did not borrow under the credit line for operating
    expenses in fiscal 2009. The maximum amount outstanding under
    our Canadian credit line for operating expenses was
    C$5.7 million in fiscal 2008 and C$3.8 million in
    fiscal 2007. There were no amounts outstanding on this line at
    the end of fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008. As of January 31,
    2009, T.K. Maxx had a credit line of £20 million. The
    maximum amount outstanding was £6.1 million in fiscal
    2009 and £16.4 million in fiscal 2008. There were no
    outstanding borrowings on this credit line at the end of fiscal
    2009 or fiscal 2008.

We believe that internally generated funds and our current
    credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating,
    debt and capital needs for at least the next twelve months. See
    Note D to the consolidated financial statements for further
    information regarding our long-term debt and other financing
    sources.

Contractual obligations:

As of January 31,
    2009, we had payment obligations (including current
    installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases for
    property and equipment and purchase obligations that will
    require cash outflows as follows (in thousands):

The long-term debt obligations above include estimated interest
    costs and assume that all holders of the zero coupon convertible
    subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2014. If
    none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not
    redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The
    effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based
    on their values as of January 31, 2009.



The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent
    and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other
    operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a
    percentage of sales, which together were approximately one-third
    of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended
    January 31, 2009.

Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders
    for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures,
    supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts
    for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under
    executive employment and other agreements. We excluded long-term
    agreements for services and operating needs that can be
    cancelled without penalty.

We also have long-term liabilities which include
    $272.9 million for employee compensation and benefits, the
    majority of which will come due beyond five years,
    $137.9 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements
    of which are included in the lease commitments in the above
    table and $240.6 million for uncertain tax positions for
    which it is not reasonably possible to predict when it may be
    paid.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We
    consider our most critical accounting policies, involving
    management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the
    areas described below. We believe that we have selected the most
    appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that
    the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions
    been selected, would not be materially different from the
    results we have reported.

Inventory valuation:

We use the retail method for
    valuing inventory on a

first-in

first-out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of
    inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a
    cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of
    inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and
    involves management estimates with regard to such things as
    markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves
    the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the
    retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the
    inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We
    believe the retail method results in a more conservative
    inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition,
    as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to
    when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for
    management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a
    shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full
    physical inventory near the fiscal year end. Thus, the
    difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause
    fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a significant
    factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail
    method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy
    and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end,
    results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly,
    many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for
    rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which
    ultimately affect the value of the inventory. Our off-price
    businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements
    with our vendors.

Impairment of long-lived assets:

We review the
    recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets at
    least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that
    would indicate that their carrying amounts are not recoverable.
    Significant judgments are involved in projecting the cash flows
    of individual stores and our business units and involve a number
    of factors including historical trends, recent performance and
    general economic assumptions. If it is determined that an
    impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an
    impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of
    the assets over the estimated fair value of the assets.

Retirement obligations:

Retirement costs are
    accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in
    the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far
    in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are
    required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the
    discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term
    rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of
    which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The
    discount rate, which we determine annually based on market
    interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return,
    which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two
    factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost
    of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified
    pension plan. The market performance on plan assets during
    fiscal 2009 was considerably worse than our expected return and
    as a result the



unfunded status of our qualified plan increased significantly.
    Despite this we were not required to fund our plan during fiscal
    2009, primarily due to voluntary funding in prior years. As of
    the date of this report we have funded $50 million into the
    qualified pension plan and may make additional voluntary
    contributions during fiscal 2010.

Share based compensation:

In accordance with
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) “Share-Based
    Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”) TJX
    estimates the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and
    directors under its stock incentive plan. The fair value of the
    awards is amortized as “stock compensation cost” over
    the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to
    provide service. We use the Black Scholes method for determining
    the fair value of stock options granted which requires
    management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use
    of different assumptions and estimates could have a material
    impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and
    the related expense.

Casualty insurance:

In July 2007, we entered into
    a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance. Our casualty
    insurance program prior to 2007 required us to estimate the
    total claims we will incur as a component of our annual
    insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the
    assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and
    other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and
    assumptions and actual results could differ from these
    estimates. If our estimate for the claims component of our
    casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2009 were to change by
    10%, the fiscal 2009 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by
    approximately $2 million. A large portion of these claims
    are funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year,
    offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of
    $20.8 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty
    insurance program as of January 31, 2009.

Income taxes:

Like many large
    corporations, our income tax returns are regularly audited by
    federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States
    and in foreign countries where we operate. Such authorities may
    challenge positions we take, and we are engaged in various
    proceedings with such authorities with respect to assessments,
    claims, deficiencies and refunds. In accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, we evaluate uncertain tax
    positions based on our evaluation of the facts, circumstances
    and information available at the reporting date and we accrue
    for exposures when we believe that it is more likely than not,
    based on the technical merits, that the positions will not be
    sustained upon examination. However, it is possible that the
    actual results of proceedings with tax authorities and in
    courts, changes in facts, expiration of statutes of limitations
    or other resolutions of tax positions will differ from the
    amounts we have accrued in either a positive or a negative
    manner, which could materially affect our effective income tax
    rate in a given financial period, the amount of taxes we are
    required to pay and our results of operations.

Reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for
    discontinued operations:

As discussed in Note B and
    Note M to the consolidated financial statements and
    elsewhere in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we
    have reserves established for probable losses arising out of the
    Computer Intrusion and for leases relating to operations
    discontinued by us where we were the original lessee or a
    guarantor and which have been assigned or sublet to third
    parties. The Computer Intrusion reserve requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions about the outcome and costs of claims,
    litigation and investigations and costs and expenses we will
    incur. We make these estimates based on our best judgments of
    the outcome of such claims, litigation and investigation and the
    amount of such costs and expenses. The leases relating to
    discontinued operations are long-term obligations and the
    estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions
    including whether and for how long we remain obligated with
    respect to a particular lease the extent to which an assignee or
    subtenant will assume our obligations under the leases, amounts
    of subtenant income, how a particular obligation may ultimately
    be settled and what mitigating factors, including
    indemnification, may exist to any liability. We develop these
    assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various
    probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each
    situation and location. We believe that our current reserves are
    a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcomes and that the
    reserves should be adequate to cover the ultimate cash costs we
    will incur. However, actual results may differ from our current
    estimates, and such differences could be material. We may
    decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for
    developments relating to the underlying assumptions.



Loss contingencies:

Certain conditions may exist
    as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may
    result in a loss to us but which will not be resolved until one
    or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management,
    where relevant, with the assistance of our legal counsel,
    assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment
    inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss
    contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending
    against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our
    legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of
    any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits
    of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein.

If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable
    that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the
    liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would
    be accrued in the financial statements. If the assessment
    indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not
    probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot
    be estimated, then we will disclose the nature of the contingent
    liability, together with an estimate of the range of the
    possible loss or a statement that such loss is not estimable.

    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading
    purposes.

FOREIGN
    CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our
    investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European
    (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) operations and on the translation of
    these foreign operations into the U. S. dollar. As more fully
    described in Notes A and E to the consolidated financial
    statements to the Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009, we hedge a
    significant portion of our intercompany transactions with
    foreign operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments
    incurred by these operations, with derivative financial
    instruments. During fiscal 2009 we ceased hedging our net
    investment position in our foreign operations. We enter into
    derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic
    exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts,
    designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying
    exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are
    creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major
    industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis
    assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency
    exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the
    underlying exposures described above as well as the translation
    of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of
    January 31, 2009, the analysis indicated that such an
    adverse movement would not have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position but could have reduced our
    pre-tax income from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 by
    approximately $37 million.

INTEREST
    RATE RISK

Our cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain
    lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in
    interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us. In
    addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and
    future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest
    expense. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to
    manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use
    of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market
    conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a
    hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to
    the maximum variable rate debt outstanding. As of
    January 31, 2009, the analysis indicated that such an
    adverse movement would not have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.



EQUITY
    PRICE RISK

The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of
    which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks
    and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the
    pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control
    our exposure to these market uncertainties. Investments, in
    general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate,
    credit, and overall market volatility. As a result of the
    significant decline in the capital markets in 2009 the value of
    our pension plan assets decreased substantially increasing the
    unfunded status of our plan and reducing shareholder’s
    equity on our balance sheet.

    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of our management, including our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by
    this report pursuant to

Rules 13a-15

and

15d-15

of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring
    that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
    that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
    (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
    the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms;
    and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and
    procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
    provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
    and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating
    the cost-benefit relationship of implementing possible controls
    and procedures.

(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009
    identified in connection with our Chief Executive Officer’s
    and Chief Financial Officer’s evaluation that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(c) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or
    under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal
    financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and
    effected by our board of directors, management and other
    personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles and includes those
    policies and procedures that:

    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of TJX;



—

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of TJX are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    TJX; and

—

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
    TJX’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable
    assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the
    preparation and fair presentation of published financial
    statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal
    control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
    effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
    financial statement preparation and presentation. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 31, 2009 based on the framework in Internal
    Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”). Based on that evaluation, management
    concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of January 31, 2009.

(d) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public
    Accounting Firm

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited and reported on our consolidated
    financial statements contained herein, has audited the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 31, 2009, and has issued an attestation
    report on the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting included herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of The TJX Companies,
    Inc:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of The TJX Companies, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 31,
    2009 and January 26, 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended January 31, 2009 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of January 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
    responsible for these financial statements and financial
    statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control
    over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note K to the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement
    obligations as of January 27, 2007. In addition, as
    discussed in Note J to the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for uncertain tax positions as of January 28,
    2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The TJX
    Companies, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

A.

Summary
    of Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated financial
    statements of The TJX Companies, Inc. (referred to as
    “TJX” or “we”) include the financial
    statements of all of TJX’s subsidiaries, all of which are
    wholly owned. All of TJX’s activities are conducted within
    TJX or its subsidiaries and are consolidated in these financial
    statements. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated
    in consolidation.

Fiscal Year:

TJX’s fiscal year ends on the
    last Saturday in January. The fiscal year ended January 31,
    2009 (“fiscal 2009”) included 53 weeks, while the
    fiscal years ended January 26, 2008 (“fiscal
    2008”) and January 27, 2007 (“fiscal 2007”)
    each included 52 weeks.

Earnings Per Share:

All earnings per share amounts
    discussed refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise
    indicated.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of the financial
    statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America, requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent
    liabilities, at the date of the financial statements as well as
    the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. TJX considers the more significant accounting
    policies that involve management estimates and judgments to be
    those relating to inventory valuation, impairments of long-lived
    assets, retirement obligations, share based compensation,
    casualty insurance, accounting for taxes, reserves for Computer
    Intrusion related costs and for discontinued operations, and
    loss contingencies. Actual amounts could differ from those
    estimates, and such differences could be material.

Revenue Recognition:

TJX records revenue at the
    time of sale and receipt of merchandise by the customer, net of
    a reserve for estimated returns. We estimate returns based upon
    our historical experience. We defer recognition of a layaway
    sale and its related profit to the accounting period when the
    customer receives the layaway merchandise. Proceeds from the
    sale of store cards as well as the value of store cards issued
    to customers as a result of a return or exchange, are deferred
    until the customers use the cards to acquire merchandise. Based
    on historical experience, we estimate the amount of store cards
    that will not be redeemed (“breakage”) and, to the
    extent allowed by local law, these amounts are amortized into
    income over the redemption period. Revenue recognized from store
    card breakage was $10.7 million in fiscal 2009,
    $10.1 million in fiscal 2008 and $7.6 million in
    fiscal 2007.

Consolidated Statements of Income Classifications:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, include the
    cost of merchandise sold and gains and losses on inventory and
    fuel-related derivative contracts; store occupancy costs
    (including real estate taxes, utility and maintenance costs and
    fixed asset depreciation); the costs of operating our
    distribution centers; payroll, benefits and travel costs
    directly associated with buying inventory; and systems costs
    related to the buying and tracking of inventory.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include store
    payroll and benefit costs; communication costs; credit and check
    expenses; advertising; administrative and field management
    payroll, benefits and travel costs; corporate administrative
    costs and depreciation; gains and losses on non-inventory
    related foreign currency exchange contracts; and other
    miscellaneous income and expense items.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

TJX generally considers
    highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
    less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Our
    investments are primarily high-grade commercial paper,
    institutional money market funds and time deposits with major
    banks.

Merchandise Inventories:

Inventories are stated at
    the lower of cost or market. TJX uses the retail method for
    valuing inventories on the

first-in

first-out basis. We almost exclusively utilize a permanent
    markdown strategy and lower the cost value of the inventory that
    is subject to markdown at the time the retail prices are lowered
    in our stores. We accrue for inventory obligations at the time
    inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by
    TJX.

F-7


At January 31, 2009 and January 26, 2008, in-transit
    inventory included in merchandise inventories was
    $329.9 million and $362.9 million, respectively.
    Comparable amounts were reflected in accounts payable at those
    dates.

Common Stock and Equity:

Equity transactions
    consist primarily of the repurchase of our common stock under
    our stock repurchase programs and the amortization of expense
    and issuance of common stock under our stock incentive plan.
    Under our stock repurchase programs we repurchase our common
    stock on the open market. The par value of the shares
    repurchased is charged to common stock with the excess of the
    purchase price over par first charged against any available
    additional paid- in capital (“APIC”) and the balance
    charged to retained earnings. Due to the high volume of
    repurchases over the past several years, we have no remaining
    balance in APIC in any of the years presented. All shares
    repurchased have been retired.

Shares issued under TJX’s stock incentive plan are issued
    from authorized but unissued shares, and proceeds received are
    recorded by increasing common stock for the par value of the
    shares with the excess over par added to APIC. Income tax
    benefits upon the expensing of options result in the creation of
    a deferred tax asset, while income tax benefits due to the
    exercise of stock options reduce deferred tax assets to the
    extent that an asset for the related grant has been created. Any
    tax benefit greater than the deferred tax asset created at the
    time of expensing the option is credited to APIC; any
    deficiencies in the tax benefit is debited to APIC to the extent
    a ‘pool’ for such deficiencies exists. In the absence
    of a pool any deficiencies are realized in the related
    periods’ statements of income through the provision for
    income taxes. The excess income tax benefits, if any, are
    included in cash flows from financing activities in the
    statements of cash flows. The par value of restricted stock
    awards is also added to common stock when the stock is issued,
    generally at grant date. The fair value of the restricted stock
    awards in excess of par value is added to APIC as the award is
    amortized into earnings over the related vesting period.

Share Based Compensation:

TJX accounts for share
    based compensation under the provisions of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
    2004)

“Share-Based Payment”

(SFAS No. 123(R)). For purposes of applying the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), the fair value of each
    option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black
    Scholes option pricing model. See Note H for a detailed
    discussion of share based compensation.

Interest:

TJX’s interest (income) expense,
    net was expense of $14.3 million in fiscal 2009, income of
    $1.6 million in fiscal 2008 and expense of
    $15.6 million in fiscal 2007. Interest (income) expense is
    presented as a net amount. TJX had gross interest income of
    $22.2 million, $40.7 million and $23.6 million in
    fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We capitalize interest
    during the active construction period of major capital projects.
    Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the related assets.
    TJX capitalized interest of $1.6 million in fiscal 2009 and
    $799,000 in fiscal 2008. No interest was capitalized in fiscal
    2007. Debt discount and related issue expenses are amortized to
    interest expense using the effective interest method over the
    lives of the related debt issues or to the first date the
    holders of the debt may require TJX to repurchase such debt.

Depreciation and Amortization:

For financial
    reporting purposes, TJX provides for depreciation and
    amortization of property by the use of the straight-line method
    over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are
    depreciated over 33 years. Leasehold costs and improvements
    are generally amortized over their useful life or the committed
    lease term (typically 10 years), whichever is shorter.
    Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over 3 to
    10 years. Depreciation and amortization expense for
    property was $398.0 million for fiscal 2009,
    $364.2 million for fiscal 2008 and $347.0 million for
    fiscal 2007. Amortization expense for property held under a
    capital lease was $2.2 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and
    2007. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
    incurred. Significant costs incurred for internally developed
    software are capitalized and amortized over 3 to 10 years.
    Upon retirement or sale, the cost of disposed assets and the
    related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any gain or
    loss is included in net income. Pre-opening costs, including
    rent, are expensed as incurred.

Lease Accounting:

TJX records rent expense when it
    takes possession of a store, which occurs before the
    commencement of the lease term, as specified in the lease, and
    generally 30 to 60 days prior to the opening of the store.
    This results in an acceleration of the commencement of rent
    expense for each lease, as we record rent expense during the
    pre-opening period, but a reduction in monthly rent expense, as
    the total rent due under the lease is amortized over a greater
    number of months.

F-8


Goodwill and Tradename:

Goodwill is primarily the
    excess of the purchase price paid over the carrying value of the
    minority interest acquired in fiscal 1990 in TJX’s former
    83%-owned subsidiary and represents goodwill associated with the
    T.J. Maxx chain, which is included in the Marmaxx segment in all
    periods presented. In addition, goodwill includes the excess of
    cost over the estimated fair market value of the net assets of
    Winners acquired by TJX in fiscal 1991.

Goodwill totaled $71.8 million as of January 31, 2009,
    $72.2 million as of January 26, 2008 and
    $71.9 million as of January 27, 2007. Goodwill is
    considered to have an indefinite life and accordingly is not
    amortized. Changes in goodwill are attributable to the effect of
    exchange rate changes on Winners’ reported goodwill.

Tradename is the value assigned to the name
    “Marshalls,” acquired by TJX in fiscal 1996 as part of
    the acquisition of the Marshalls chain. The value of the
    tradename was determined by the discounted present value of
    assumed after-tax royalty payments, offset by a reduction for
    their pro-rata share of negative goodwill acquired. The
    Marshalls tradename is carried at a value of
    $107.7 million, and is considered to have an indefinite
    life.

TJX occasionally acquires or licenses other trademarks to be
    used in connection with private label merchandise. Such
    trademarks are included in other assets and are amortized to
    cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, over their
    useful life, generally from 7 to 10 years. Trademarks and
    the related amortization are included in the operating segment
    for which they were acquired.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and
    Tradename:

TJX evaluates its long-lived assets and
    assets with indefinite lives (other than Goodwill and Tradename)
    for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable, and at least annually in the fourth quarter of a
    fiscal year.  The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed
    at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is
    generally at the individual store level.  If indicators of
    impairment are identified, an undiscounted cash flow analysis is
    performed to determine if an impairment exists.  The store by
    store evaluations did not indicate any recoverability issues
    (for any of our continuing operations) during the past three
    fiscal years.  An impairment exists when the undiscounted cash
    flow of an asset or asset group is less than the carrying cost
    of that asset or asset group.

Goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of Goodwill may
    exceed its fair value and at least annually in the fourth
    quarter of a fiscal year, by comparing the carrying value of the
    related reporting unit to its fair value.  An impairment exists
    when this analysis shows that the fair value is less than its
    carrying cost.  The fair value of our reporting units, using
    typical valuation models such as the discounted cash flow
    method, is considerably higher than the book values and no
    impairment has occurred in the last three fiscal years.

Tradename is also tested for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    the Tradename may exceed its fair value and at least annually in
    the fourth quarter of a fiscal year.  Testing is performed by
    comparing the discounted present value of assumed after-tax
    royalty payments to the carrying value of the Tradename.  No
    impairment has occurred in the last three fiscal years.

Advertising Costs:

TJX expenses advertising costs
    as incurred. Advertising expense was $254.0 million,
    $255.0 million and $221.0 million for fiscal 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):

TJX’s foreign assets and liabilities are translated at the
    fiscal year end exchange rate. Activity of the foreign
    operations that affects the statements of income and cash flows
    is translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during
    the fiscal year. The translation adjustments associated with the
    foreign operations are included in shareholders’ equity as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
    Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments included in
    shareholders’ equity amounted to a loss of
    $152.9 million, net of related tax effect of
    $2.6 million, as of January 31, 2009; a gain of
    $17.8 million, net of related tax effect of
    $23.7 million, as of January 26, 2008; and a loss of
    $3.2 million, net of related tax effect of
    $15.8 million, as of January 27, 2007.

F-9


TJX enters into financial instruments to manage our cost of
    borrowing and to manage our exposure to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. TJX recognizes all derivative
    instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statements of
    financial position and measures those instruments at fair value.
    Changes to the fair value of derivative contracts that do not
    qualify for hedge accounting are reported in earnings in the
    period of the change. For derivatives that qualify for hedge
    accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are
    either recorded in shareholders’ equity as a component of
    other comprehensive income or are recognized currently in
    earnings, along with an offsetting adjustment against the basis
    of the item being hedged. Cumulative gains and losses on
    derivatives that hedged our net investment in foreign operations
    and deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges that have been
    recorded in other comprehensive income amounted to a gain of
    $27.3 million, net of related tax effects of
    $18.2 million at January 31, 2009; a loss of
    $42.1 million, net of related tax effects of
    $28.1 million at January 26, 2008; and a loss of
    $25.2 million, net of related tax effects of
    $16.8 million at January 27, 2007.

The requirement to recognize the funded status of TJX’s
    post retirement benefit plans in accordance with
    SFAS No. 158 (discussed in Note K) resulted
    in a loss adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income
    of $92.2 million, net of related tax effects of
    $61.5 million at January 31, 2009. The cumulative loss
    adjustment at January 26, 2008 was $4.4 million, net
    of related tax effects of $3.7 million and was
    $5.6 million, net of related tax effects of
    $3.7 million at January 27, 2007.

Loss Contingencies:

TJX records a reserve for loss
    contingencies when it is both probable that a loss has been
    incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. TJX
    reviews pending litigation and other contingencies at least
    quarterly and adjusts the reserve for such contingencies for
    changes in probable and reasonably estimable losses. TJX
    includes an estimate for related legal costs at the time such
    costs are both probable and reasonably estimable.

New Accounting Standards:

In December 2008, the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Staff
    Position (FSP) No. FAS 132(R)-1 Employers’
    Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets which is
    effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009.
    This FSP requires additional disclosures such as the investment
    allocation decision making process; the fair value of each major
    category of plan assets; inputs and valuation techniques used to
    measure the fair value of plan assets and significant
    concentrations of risk within plan assets. We are in the process
    of assessing the impact of FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1 on our
    financial statement disclosures.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007) “Business Combinations”
    (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and
    requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and
    measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
    acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
    interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R also provides guidance
    for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in business
    combinations and what information to disclose to enable users of
    the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008 and is to be applied prospectively. TJX
    will consider the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of
    SFAS 141R on its future business combinations.

In April 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 142-3,

which amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible.

FSP 142-3

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. As this guidance applies only to
    assets we may acquire in the future, we are not able to predict
    its impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.

At its June 2008 meeting the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task
    Force (EITF) issue

08-03:

Accounting by Lessees for Maintenance Deposits, which clarifies
    how a lessee shall account for a maintenance deposit under an
    arrangement accounted for as a lease.

EITF 08-03

is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are
    in the process of assessing the impact of

EITF 08-03

and do not believe it will have a material impact on our results
    of operations or financial condition.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161, which requires
    disclosures of how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    are accounted for and how derivative instruments

F-10


and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial
    position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161
    is effective for TJX in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are
    in the process of assessing the impact of SFAS 161 on our
    financial statement disclosures.

Reclassifications:

For comparative purposes we
    reclassified activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows in fiscal 2008 and 2007 for “Proceeds (payments) to
    settle net investment hedges” from operating activities to
    investing activities. This reclassification had no impact on net
    income or total cash flows as previously reported.

B.

Provision
    for Computer Intrusion related costs

TJX has incurred losses as a result of an unauthorized intrusion
    or intrusions (the intrusion or intrusions, collectively, the
    “Computer Intrusion”) into portions of its computer
    system, which was discovered late in fiscal 2007 and in which
    TJX believes customer data were stolen. During the first six
    months of fiscal 2008, we expensed pre-tax costs of
    $37.8 million for costs we incurred related to the Computer
    Intrusion. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we established
    a pre-tax reserve of $178.1 million to reflect our
    estimation of probable losses in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles with respect to the Computer
    Intrusion and recorded a pre-tax charge in that amount. We
    reduced the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs by
    $30.5 million in fiscal 2009 and $18.9 million in
    fiscal 2008 as a result of negotiations, settlements, insurance
    proceeds and adjustments in our estimated losses. Our reserve of
    $42.2 million at January 31, 2009 includes our current
    estimation of total potential cash liabilities, from pending
    litigation, proceedings, investigations and other claims, as
    well as legal, ongoing monitoring and other costs and expenses,
    arising from the Computer Intrusion. As an estimate, our reserve
    is subject to uncertainty, and our actual costs may vary from
    our current estimate and such variations may be material. We may
    decrease or increase the amount of our reserve to adjust for
    developments in the course and resolution of litigation, claims
    and investigations and related expenses, insurance proceeds and
    changes in our estimates.

C.

Discontinued
    Operations

Sale of Bob’s Stores:

In fiscal 2009, TJX
    sold Bob’s Stores and recorded as a component of
    discontinued operations a loss on disposal (including expenses
    relating to the sale) of $19.0 million, net of tax benefits
    of $13.0 million. The net carrying value of Bob’s
    Stores assets sold was $33 million, which consisted
    primarily of merchandise inventory of $56 million, offset
    by merchandise payable of $21 million. The loss on disposal
    reflects sales proceeds of $7.2 million as well as expenses
    relating to the sale of $5.8 million. TJX remains
    contingently liable on several of the Bob’s Stores leases
    which are discussed in Note M to the consolidated financial
    statements.

TJX also reclassified the operating results of Bob’s Stores
    for all periods prior to the sale as a component of discontinued
    operations. The following table presents the net sales, segment
    profit (loss) and after-tax loss from operations reclassified to
    discontinued operations for all periods prior to the sale of

A.J. Wright Store Closings:

During the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007, management developed a plan to close
    34 underperforming A.J. Wright stores. The plan was
    approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors on
    November 27, 2006, and virtually all of the stores were
    closed as of the end of fiscal 2007. The after-tax cost of the
    store closings of $38.1 million, or $0.08 per share, was
    recorded as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.

TJX also classified the operating income (loss) of the 34 closed
    stores for fiscal 2007, as well as all prior periods, as a
    component of discontinued operations. The operating loss of the
    closed stores for fiscal 2007 included in discontinued
    operations was $1.0 million.

The above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero
    coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options
    in fiscal 2014. Any of the notes on which put options are not
    exercised, redeemed or converted will mature in fiscal 2022.

In January 2006, TJX entered into a C$235.0 million term
    credit facility (through our Canadian subsidiary, Winners) due
    in January 2010. This debt is guaranteed by TJX. Interest is
    payable on borrowings under this facility at rates equal to or
    less than Canadian prime rate. The variable rate on this
    facility was 1.69% at January 31, 2009. The proceeds were
    used to fund the repatriation of earnings from Winners as well
    as other general corporate purposes of Winners.

In February 2001, TJX issued $517.5 million zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes due in February 2021 and raised
    gross proceeds of $347.6 million. The issue price of the
    notes represented a yield to maturity of 2% per year. Due to the
    first put option on February 13, 2002, we amortized the
    debt discount assuming a 1.5% yield for fiscal 2002.

F-12


The notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior
    indebtedness of TJX. The outstanding notes are convertible into
    15.2 million shares of common stock of TJX if the sale
    price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds, if the
    credit rating of the notes is below investment grade, if the
    notes are called for redemption or if certain specified
    corporate transactions occur. Each holder of the notes has the
    right to require us to purchase the notes on February 13,
    2013 at original purchase price plus accrued original issue
    discount for a total of $396.5 million for all notes. We
    may pay the purchase price in cash, TJX stock or a combination
    of the two. If the holders exercise their put options, we expect
    to fund the payment with cash, financing from our short-term
    credit facility, new long-term borrowings or a combination
    thereof. A total of 52,552 notes were converted into common
    shares in fiscal 2009. There were two notes put to TJX on
    February 13, 2007 and three on February 13, 2004. In
    addition, if a change in control of TJX occurs on or before
    February 13, 2013, each holder may require TJX to purchase
    for cash all or a portion of such holder’s notes. As of
    February 13, 2007 TJX can redeem for cash all, or a portion
    of, the notes at any time for the original purchase price plus
    accrued original issue discount.

Included in current installments of long-term debt are the fair
    value of interest rate swaps of $1.6 million;
    $199.9 million of 7.45% unsecured notes (net of debt
    discount of $55,000) which mature in December 2009 and a term
    credit facility of $191.3 million (C$235.0 million)
    which matures in January 2010.

TJX has a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing
    May 2010 and a $500 million revolving credit facility
    maturing May 2011. These agreements have no compensating balance
    requirements and have various covenants including a requirement
    of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. These agreements serve
    as back up to TJX’s commercial paper program. As of
    January 31, 2009, there were no outstanding amounts under
    our credit facilities, and the maximum amount of our
    U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was
    $222.0 million during fiscal 2009. The weighted average
    interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was 3.92%
    in fiscal 2009. We did not borrow under these credit facilities
    during fiscal 2008, and the maximum amount of our
    U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was
    $204.5 million during fiscal 2007.

As of January 31, 2009 and January 26, 2008, Winners
    had two credit lines, one for C$10 million for operating
    expenses and one C$10 million letter of credit facility.
    Winners did not borrow under the credit line for operating
    expenses in fiscal 2009. The maximum amount outstanding under
    Winners’ Canadian credit line for operating expenses was
    C$5.7 million in fiscal 2008 and C$3.8 million in
    fiscal 2007. There were no amounts outstanding on this line at
    the end of fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008. As of January 31,
    2009, T.K. Maxx had a credit line of £20 million. The
    maximum amount outstanding under this line was
    £6.1 million in fiscal 2009 and
    £16.4 million in fiscal 2008. There were no
    outstanding borrowings on this credit line at the end of fiscal
    2009 or fiscal 2008.

Financial
    Instruments

TJX enters into financial instruments to manage its cost of
    borrowing and to manage its exposure to changes in fuel costs
    and foreign currency exchange rates.

Interest Rate Contracts:

In December 1999, prior
    to the issuance of $200 million ten-year notes, TJX entered
    into a rate-lock agreement to hedge the underlying treasury rate
    of the notes. The cost of this agreement is being amortized to
    interest expense over the term of the notes and results in an
    effective fixed rate of 7.60% on these notes. During fiscal
    2004, TJX entered into interest rate swaps on $100 million
    of the $200 million ten-year notes effectively converting
    the interest on that portion of the unsecured notes from fixed
    to a floating rate of interest indexed to the six-month LIBOR
    rate. The maturity dates of the interest rate swaps are the same
    as the maturity date of the underlying debt. Under these swaps,
    TJX pays a specified variable interest rate and receives the
    fixed rate applicable to the underlying debt. The interest
    income/expense on the swaps is accrued as earned and recorded as
    an adjustment to the interest expense accrued on the fixed-rate
    debt. The interest rate swaps are designated as fair value
    hedges of the underlying debt. The fair value of the contracts,
    excluding the net interest accrual, amounted to an asset of
    $1.6 million as of January 31, 2009, an asset of
    $1.2 million at January 26, 2008, and a liability of
    $4.4 million, as of January 27, 2007. The valuation of
    the swaps results in an offsetting fair value adjustment to the
    debt hedged. Accordingly, current installments of long-term debt
    has been increased by $1.6 million in fiscal 2009. The
    long-term debt has been increased by $1.2 million in fiscal
    2008 and reduced by $4.4 million in fiscal 2007. The
    average effective interest rate on

F-13


$100 million of the 7.45% unsecured notes, inclusive of the
    effect of hedging activity, was approximately 6.54% in fiscal
    2009, 8.77% in fiscal 2008 and 9.42% in fiscal 2007.

Concurrent with the issuance of the C$235 million
    three-year note in fiscal 2006, TJX entered an interest rate
    swap on the principal amount of the note effectively converting
    the interest on the note from floating to a fixed rate. In
    January 2009 this interest rate swap settled, one year before
    the maturity date of the underlying debt which was extended one
    year to January 2010. Under this swap TJX paid a specified fixed
    interest rate and received the floating rate applicable to the
    underlying debt. The interest income/expense on the swap was
    accrued as earned and recorded as an adjustment to the interest
    expense accrued on the floating-rate debt. The interest rate
    swap was designated as a cash flow hedge of the underlying debt.
    The fair value of the interest rate swap, excluding the net
    interest accrual, amounted to an asset of $1.1 million
    (C$1.1 million) as of January 26, 2008 and an asset of
    $699,000 (C$825,000) as of January 27, 2007. The valuation
    of the swap resulted in an adjustment to other comprehensive
    income of a similar amount. The average effective interest rate
    on the note, inclusive of the effect of hedging activity, was
    approximately 4.50% in both fiscal 2009 and 2008.

Diesel Fuel Contracts:

During fiscal 2009, TJX
    entered into three agreements to hedge approximately 30% of its
    notional diesel fuel requirements for fiscal 2010, based on the
    diesel fuel consumed by independent freight carriers
    transporting the Company’s inventory. These carriers charge
    TJX a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price increases as
    incurred by the freight carrier. The hedge agreements are
    designed to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel pricing (and
    the resulting per mile surcharges payable by TJX) by setting a
    fixed price per gallon for the year. TJX elected not to apply
    hedge accounting rules to these contracts. The change in the
    market value of the hedge agreements resulted in a
    $4.9 million loss in fiscal 2009, which is reflected in
    cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs. All of the
    diesel fuel hedge agreements expire in February 2010.

Foreign Currency Contracts:

TJX enters into
    forward foreign currency exchange contracts to obtain economic
    hedges on firm U.S. dollar and Euro denominated merchandise
    purchase commitments made by its foreign subsidiaries, T.K. Maxx
    (United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany) and Winners (Canada).
    These commitments are typically six months or less in duration.
    The contracts outstanding at January 31, 2009 covered
    certain commitments for the first quarter of fiscal 2010. TJX
    elected not to apply hedge accounting rules to these contracts.
    The change in the fair value of these contracts resulted in a
    loss of $2.3 million in fiscal 2009, income of
    $6.6 million in fiscal 2008 and income of $1.2 million
    in fiscal 2007 and is included in earnings as a component of
    cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs.

Effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, TJX no longer
    entered into contracts to hedge its net investments in foreign
    subsidiaries and settled all existing contracts. As a result,
    there were no net investment contracts as of January 31,
    2009. Until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, TJX entered into
    foreign currency forward and swap contracts in both Canadian
    dollars and British pound sterling and accounted for them as
    hedges of the net investment in and between foreign subsidiaries
    or cash flow hedges of Winners long-term intercompany debt.

TJX applied hedge accounting to these hedge contracts of our
    investment in foreign subsidiaries, and changes in fair value of
    these contracts, as well as gains and losses upon settlement,
    were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income,
    offsetting changes in the cumulative foreign translation
    adjustments of the foreign subsidiaries. The change in fair
    value of the contracts designated as hedges of the investment in
    foreign subsidiaries resulted in a gain of $68.8 million,
    net of income taxes, in fiscal 2009, a loss of
    $15.8 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2008, and a
    loss of $5.6 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2007.
    The change in the cumulative foreign currency translation
    adjustment resulted in a gain of $171.2 million, net of
    income taxes, in fiscal 2009, a gain of $21.0 million, net
    of income taxes, in fiscal 2008, and a gain of
    $20.4 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2007. Amounts
    included in other comprehensive income relating to cash flow
    hedges were reclassified to earnings as the underlying exposure
    on the debt had an impact on earnings. The net amount
    reclassified from other comprehensive income to the income
    statement in fiscal 2009 related to cash flow hedges was
    $677,368, net of income taxes. The net loss recognized in fiscal
    2008 related to cash flow hedges was $1.1 million, net of
    income taxes. The net loss recognized in fiscal 2007 related to

F-14


cash flow hedges was $5.0 million, net of income taxes,
    which was offset by a non-taxable gain of $4.6 million,
    related to the underlying exposure.

On July 20, 2006 TJX determined that the C$355 million
    intercompany loan, due from Winners to TJX, would not be payable
    in the foreseeable future due to the capital and cash flow needs
    of Winners. As a result, that intercompany loan and the related
    currency swap that had been designated as a cash flow hedge of
    long-term intercompany debt were re-designated as a net
    investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency
    gains or losses on the intercompany loan and gains or losses on
    the related currency swap from re-designation date to date of
    settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, to the extent
    effective, have been recorded in other comprehensive income. The
    ineffective portion of the currency swap resulted in pre-tax
    charges to the income statement of $2.2 million in fiscal
    2009, $9.1 million in fiscal 2008 and $2.9 million in
    fiscal 2007.

TJX also enters into derivative contracts, generally designated
    as fair value hedges, to hedge intercompany debt and
    intercompany interest payable. The changes in fair value of
    these contracts are recorded in the statements of income and are
    offset by marking the underlying item to fair value in the same
    period. Upon settlement, the realized gains and losses on these
    contracts are offset by the realized gains and losses of the
    underlying item in the statement of income. The net impact on
    the income statement of hedging activity related to these
    intercompany payables was immaterial.

The value of foreign currency exchange contracts relating to
    inventory commitments is reported in earnings as a component of
    cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs. The income
    statement impact of all other foreign currency derivative
    contracts and underlying exposures is reported as a component of
    selling, general and administrative expenses.

TJX’s forward foreign currency exchange and swap contracts
    require TJX to make payments of certain foreign currencies or
    U.S. dollars for receipt of Canadian dollars,
    U.S. dollars or Euros. All of the contracts outstanding at
    January 31, 2009 mature during fiscal 2010.

The counterparties to the forward exchange contracts and swap
    agreements are major international financial institutions and
    the contracts contain rights of offset, which minimize our
    exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by one of
    the counterparties. We do not require counterparties to maintain
    collateral for these contracts. We periodically monitor our
    position and the credit ratings of the counterparties and do not
    anticipate losses resulting from the nonperformance of these
    institutions.

Disclosures
    about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standard No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes a
    common definition for fair value to be applied to U.S. GAAP
    requiring use of fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair
    value measurements. SFAS 157 was effective for financial
    assets and financial liabilities for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. Issued in February 2008,

FSP 157-1

“Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB
    Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That
    Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease
    Classification or Measurement under Statement 13” removed
    leasing transactions accounted for under FASB Statement
    No. 13 and related guidance from the scope of
    SFAS 157.

FSP 157-2

“Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement
    157,” deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 for all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for
    those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a
    recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008.

The implementation of SFAS 157 for financial assets and
    financial liabilities, effective January 27, 2008 for TJX,
    did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    position and results of operations. TJX is currently assessing
    the impact of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and
    nonfinancial liabilities on its consolidated financial position
    and results of operations.

SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
    orderly transaction between market participants at the
    measurement date (exit price). SFAS 157 classifies the
    inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
    similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for
    identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
    not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are
    observable for the asset or liability.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their
    entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant
    to the fair value measurement. TJX has determined that its
    financial assets and liabilities at January 31, 2009 were
    generally

F-16


classified within level 1 or level 2 in the fair value
    hierarchy. The following table sets forth TJX’s financial
    assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on
    a recurring basis:

The fair value of our general corporate debt, including current
    installments, is estimated by obtaining market value quotes
    given the trading levels of other bonds of the same general
    issuer type and market perceived credit quality. The fair value
    of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes is estimated
    by obtaining market quotes. The fair value of the current
    installments of long-term debt at January 31, 2009 is
    $399.9 million versus a carrying value of
    $392.9 million. The fair value of the zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes as of January 31, 2009, is
    $358.3 million versus a carrying value of
    $365.6 million. These estimates do not necessarily reflect
    provisions or restrictions in the various debt agreements that
    might affect our ability to settle these obligations.

As a result of its international operating and financing
    activities, TJX is exposed to market risks from changes in
    interest and foreign currency exchange rates, which may
    adversely affect its operating results and financial position.
    When it deems appropriate, TJX minimizes risks from interest and
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through the use of
    derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial
    instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading
    or other speculative purposes and TJX does not use leveraged
    derivative financial instruments. The forward foreign currency
    exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are valued using
    broker quotations which include observable market information.
    TJX makes no adjustments to quotes or prices obtained from
    brokers or pricing services but does assess the credit risk of
    counterparties and will adjust final valuations when
    appropriate. Where independent pricing services provide fair
    values, TJX obtained an understanding of the methods used in
    pricing. As such, these derivative instruments are classified
    within level 2.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, “The Fair
    Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities—including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 provides
    companies with an option to report selected financial assets and
    liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and
    disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons
    between companies that choose different fair value measurement
    attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities.
    SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those years
    and was adopted by TJX in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Upon
    adoption, TJX elected not to adjust any financial assets or
    liabilities not previously recorded at fair value and therefore,
    the adoption of SFAS 159 did not have an impact on
    TJX’s consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations.

Commitments

TJX is committed under long-term leases related to its
    continuing operations for the rental of real estate and fixtures
    and equipment. Most of our leases are store operating leases
    with a ten-year initial term and options to extend for one or
    more five-year periods. Certain Marshalls leases, acquired in
    fiscal 1996, had then remaining terms ranging up to twenty-five
    years. T.K. Maxx leases are generally for fifteen to twenty-five
    years with ten-year kick-out options. Many of our leases contain
    escalation clauses and early termination penalties. In addition,
    we are generally required to pay insurance, real estate taxes
    and other operating expenses including, in some cases, rentals
    based on a percentage of

F-17


sales. These expenses in the aggregate were approximately
    one-third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended
    January 31, 2009, the fiscal year ended January 26,
    2008 and the fiscal year ended January 27, 2007.

Following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for
    continuing operations as of January 31, 2009:

The capital lease relates to a 283,000-square-foot addition to
    TJX’s home office facility. Rental payments commenced
    June 1, 2001, and we recognized a capital lease asset and
    related obligation equal to the present value of the lease
    payments of $32.6 million.

Rental expense under operating leases for continuing operations
    amounted to $936.6 million for fiscal 2009,
    $875.6 million for fiscal 2008 and $816.4 million for
    fiscal 2007. Rental expense includes contingent rent and is
    reported net of sublease income. Contingent rent paid was
    $8.3 million in fiscal 2009, $9.7 million in fiscal
    2008 and $9.0 million in fiscal 2007. Sublease income was
    $2.1 million in fiscal 2009, $2.9 million in fiscal
    2008, and $3.0 million in fiscal 2007. The total net
    present value of TJX’s minimum operating lease obligations
    approximated $3,962.2 million as of January 31, 2009.

TJX had outstanding letters of credit totaling
    $32.0 million as of January 31, 2009 and
    $32.7 million as of January 26, 2008. Letters of
    credit are issued by TJX primarily for the purchase of inventory.

Stock
    Incentive Plan

Total compensation cost related to share based compensation was
    $31.2 million net of income taxes of $20.1 million in
    fiscal 2009, $37.0 million net of income taxes of
    $20.3 million in fiscal 2008 and $45.1 million net of
    income taxes of $24.7 million in fiscal 2007.

As of January 31, 2009, there was $77.5 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share
    based compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That
    cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
    of 2.0 years.

TJX has a stock incentive plan under which options and other
    share based awards may be granted to its directors, officers and
    key employees. This plan has been approved by TJX’s
    shareholders, and all stock compensation awards are made under
    this plan. The Stock Incentive Plan, as amended with shareholder
    approval, provides for the issuance of up to 145.3 million
    shares with 12.4 million shares available for future grants
    as of January 31, 2009. TJX issues shares from authorized
    but unissued common stock.

Options for the purchase of common stock have been granted at
    100% of market price on the grant date and generally vest in
    thirds over a three-year period starting one year after the
    grant, and have a ten year term. For purposes

F-18


of applying the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), the
    fair value of options is estimated as of the date of grant using
    the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
    weighted average assumptions:

Expected volatility is based on a combination of implied
    volatility from traded options on our stock, and historical
    volatility during a term approximating the expected term of the
    option granted. We use historical data to estimate option
    exercise, employee termination behavior and dividend yield
    within the valuation model. Separate employee groups and option
    characteristics are considered separately for valuation purposes
    when applicable. No such distinctions existed during the fiscal
    years presented. The expected option life represents an estimate
    of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding
    based upon historical exercise trends. The risk free rate is for
    periods within the contractual life of the option based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the
    grant.

    of the award, and have restrictions that generally lapse over
    one to four years from date of grant when and if specified

F-19


performance criteria are met. The grant date fair value of the
    award is charged to income ratably over the period during which
    these awards vest. The fair value of the awards is determined at
    date of grant and assumes that performance goals will be
    achieved. If such goals are not met, no compensation cost is
    recognized and any recognized compensation cost is reversed.

There were 173,000 shares of performance-based restricted
    stock, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $33.49,
    granted in fiscal 2009; 200,000 shares with a weighted
    average grant date fair value of $28.04 were granted in fiscal
    2008 and 236,000 shares with a weighted average grant date fair
    value of $27.16 were granted in fiscal 2007. The fair value of
    performance-based restricted stock that vested was
    $5.9 million in fiscal 2009, $3.9 million in fiscal
    2008 and $4.9 million in fiscal 2007.

In November 2005, TJX issued a market-based deferred share award
    for up to 94,000 shares to its acting chief executive
    officer which was indexed to TJX’s stock price for the

sixty-day

period beginning February 22, 2007 (“measurement
    period”). The weighted average grant date fair value of
    this award was $9.90 per share. In June 2007, 58,750 shares
    were issued under this award. In September 2007, this officer
    received a special award of 25,000 shares of common stock.

TJX also awards deferred shares to its outside directors under
    the Stock Incentive Plan. The outside directors are awarded two
    annual deferred share awards, each representing shares of TJX
    common stock valued at $50,000. One award vests immediately and
    is payable with accumulated dividends in stock at the earlier of
    separation from service as a director or change of control. The
    second award vests based on service as a director until the
    annual meeting next following the award and is payable with
    accumulated dividends in stock at vesting date, unless an
    irrevocable advance election is made whereby it is payable at
    the same time as the first award. As of the end of fiscal 2009,
    a total of 144,588 deferred shares were outstanding under the
    plan.

Capital
    Stock and Earnings Per Share

Capital Stock:

In August 2008, we completed a
    $1 billion stock repurchase program begun in fiscal 2007
    and initiated another multi-year $1 billion stock
    repurchase program that had been approved in February 2008. We
    repurchased and retired 24.0 million shares of our common
    stock at a cost of $741.1 million during fiscal 2009. TJX
    reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a
    “settlement” basis. We had cash expenditures under our
    repurchase programs of $751.1 million in fiscal 2009,
    $940.2 million in fiscal 2008 and $557.2 million in
    fiscal 2007, funded primarily by cash generated from operations.
    The total common shares repurchased amounted to
    24.3 million shares in fiscal 2009, 33.0 million
    shares in fiscal 2008 and 22.0 million shares in fiscal
    2007. As of January 31, 2009, we had repurchased
    8.9 million shares of our common stock at a cost of
    $255.1 million under the current $1 billion stock
    repurchase program. All shares repurchased under our stock
    repurchase programs have been retired.

TJX has 5 million shares of authorized but unissued
    preferred stock, $1 par value.

The fiscal 2009 net deferred tax asset is presented on the
    balance sheet as a current asset of $135.7 million and a
    non-current liability of $127.0 million. For fiscal 2008,
    the net deferred tax asset is presented on the balance sheet as
    a current asset of $163.5 million and a non-current
    liability of $42.9 million. TJX changed its assertion
    during fiscal 2008 regarding the undistributed earnings of its
    Marshalls Puerto Rico subsidiary and therefore the earnings of
    this subsidiary are no longer considered indefinitely
    reinvested. As a result, TJX recognized a $5.5 million tax
    benefit in fiscal 2008 after providing for deferred
    U.S. taxes for this subsidiary. TJX has provided for
    deferred U.S. taxes on all undistributed earnings from its
    Winners Canadian subsidiary and its Marshalls Puerto Rico
    subsidiary through January 31, 2009. All earnings of
    TJX’s other foreign subsidiaries are considered
    indefinitely reinvested and no U.S. deferred taxes have
    been provided on those earnings. The net deferred tax asset
    summarized above includes deferred taxes relating to temporary
    differences at our foreign operations and amounted to a
    $19.9 million net liability as of January 31, 2009 and
    a $26.7 million net liability as of January 26, 2008.

In fiscal 2009, TJX’s HomeGoods subsidiary utilized a
    Puerto Rico net operating loss carryforward of approximately
    $1.1 million which had not been previously recognized.
    There are no further Puerto Rico net operating losses as of the
    fiscal year ended January 31, 2009. TJX’s German
    subsidiary, which is treated as a branch for U.S. tax
    purposes, incurred net operating losses of $15.0 million in
    fiscal 2009 and $14.4 million in fiscal 2008 for tax and
    financial reporting purposes. The losses were fully utilized in
    each year to reduce TJX’s current U.S. taxable income.
    Any future utilization of the losses in Germany will result in a
    corresponding amount of taxable income for U.S. tax
    purposes.

TJX established valuation allowances against certain deferred
    tax assets which may not be realized in future years. The amount
    of the valuation allowances was $6.2 million as of
    January 31, 2009 and $4.0 million as of
    January 26, 2008.

TJX’s worldwide effective income tax rate was 36.9% for
    fiscal 2009, 37.9% for fiscal 2008 and 37.7% for fiscal 2007.
    The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income
    tax rate and TJX’s worldwide effective income tax rate is

The decrease in TJX’s effective state income tax rate for
    fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 is primarily attributed
    to the settlement of several state tax audits and the resulting
    reduction to FIN 48 reserves for uncertain tax positions.
    TJX adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN 48), in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. FIN 48
    clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a
    minimum threshold for benefit recognition of a tax position for
    financial statement purposes. FIN 48 also establishes tax
    accounting rules for measurement, classification, interest and
    penalties, disclosure and interim period accounting. As a result
    of the implementation, TJX recognized a charge of approximately
    $27.2 million to its retained earnings balance at the
    beginning of fiscal 2008. TJX had net unrecognized tax benefits
    of $129.9 million as of January 31, 2009,
    $140.7 million as of January 26, 2008 and
    $124.4 million as of January 28, 2007.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are
    items that will not impact future effective tax rates upon
    recognition. These items amount to $49.3 million as of
    January 31, 2009 and $67.8 million as of
    January 26, 2008.

TJX is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income
    tax in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions. In
    nearly all jurisdictions, the tax years through fiscal 2001 are
    no longer subject to examination.

TJX’s accounting policy is to classify interest and
    penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax
    expense. The amount of interest and penalties expensed was
    $15.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009 and
    $16.2 million for the year ended January 26, 2008. The
    accrued amounts for interest and penalties are
    $51.1 million as of January 31, 2009 and
    $52.5 million as of January 26, 2008.

Based on the outcome of tax examinations, judicial proceedings
    or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations in
    specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that
    unrecognized tax benefits for certain tax positions taken on
    previously filed tax returns may change materially from those
    represented on the financial statements as of January 31,
    2009. During the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible
    that such circumstances may occur that would have a material
    effect on previously unrecognized tax benefits. As a result, the
    total net amount of unrecognized tax

F-23


benefits may decrease, which would reduce the provision for
    taxes on earnings by a range estimated at $2.0 million to
    $70.0 million.

Pension
    Plans and Other Retirement Benefits

Pension:

TJX has a funded defined benefit
    retirement plan covering the majority of its full-time
    U.S. employees. Employees who have attained twenty-one
    years of age and have completed one year of service are covered
    under the plan. No employee contributions are required and
    benefits are based on compensation earned in each year of
    service. As a result of an amendment to the plan, employees
    hired after February 1, 2006 do not participate in this
    plan but are eligible to receive enhanced employer contributions
    to their 401(k) plans. This plan amendment did not have a
    material impact on pension expense for the last three fiscal
    years, but is expected to gradually reduce net periodic pension
    costs in subsequent years due to a reduction in participants.
    Our funded defined benefit retirement plan assets are invested
    in domestic and international equity and fixed income
    securities, both directly and through investment funds. The plan
    does not invest in the securities of TJX. TJX also has an
    unfunded supplemental retirement plan which covers key employees
    and provides for additional retirement benefits based on average
    compensation for certain employees.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans—An amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106
    and 132(R)” (SFAS No. 158).
    SFAS No. 158 requires the recognition of the funded
    status of a benefit plan in the balance sheet; the recognition
    in other comprehensive income of gains or losses and prior
    service costs or credits arising during the period but which are
    not included as components of periodic benefit cost; the
    measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of
    the balance sheet date (the measurement provisions); and
    disclosure of additional information about the effects on
    periodic benefit cost for the following fiscal year arising from
    delayed recognition in the current period. The recognition of
    the funded status of plans on the balance sheet was required for
    our fiscal year ended January 27, 2007. The adjustment to
    accumulated other comprehensive income of initially applying the
    recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 for our pension
    and postretirement plans was a reduction, net of taxes, of
    $5.6 million in fiscal 2007.

TJX deferred the implementation of the measurement provisions of
    SFAS No. 158 until fiscal 2008. The impact of adopting
    the measurement provisions was to increase our post retirement
    liabilities by $2.7 million and an adjustment to retained
    earnings of $1.6 million, net of income taxes of
    $1.1 million, which represents the net benefit cost from
    January 1, 2007 to January 27, 2007. The valuation
    date for both plans in fiscal 2007 was as of December 31,
    2006.

Presented below is financial information relating to TJX’s
    funded defined benefit retirement plan (funded plan) and its
    unfunded supplemental pension plan (unfunded plan) for the

The consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of the

    $233.7 million at January 31, 2009 is reflected on the
    balance sheet as of that date as a current liability of
    $13.1 million and a long-term liability of
    $220.6 million.

The combined net accrued liability of $62.9 million at
    January 26, 2008 is reflected on the balance sheet as of
    that date as a current liability of $2.7 million and a
    long-term liability of $60.2 million.

The estimated prior service cost that will be amortized from
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic
    benefit cost in fiscal 2010 is $15,354 for the funded plan and
    $124,652 for the unfunded plan. The estimated net actuarial loss
    that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in fiscal 2010 is
    $13.6 million for the funded plan and $861,926 for the
    unfunded plan.

TJX selects the assumed discount rate using the Citigroup
    Pension Liability Index. TJX develops its long-term rate of
    return assumption by evaluating input from professional advisors
    taking into account the asset allocation of the portfolio and
    long-term asset class return expectations, as well as long-term
    inflation assumptions.

TJX made aggregate cash contributions of $2.8 million in
    fiscal 2009, $27.5 million in fiscal 2008 and
    $7.4 million in fiscal 2007 to the defined benefit
    retirement plan and to fund current benefit and expense payments
    under the unfunded supplemental retirement plan. The cash
    contributions made in fiscal 2009 and 2007 were solely to fund
    current benefit and expense payments under the unfunded
    supplemental retirement plan. Through fiscal 2008 our funding
    policy for the funded plan was to fund any required contribution
    to the plan at the full funding limitation and generally to fund
    contributions in excess of any required contribution so as to
    fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation to the extent such
    contribution is allowed for tax purposes. As a result of
    voluntary funding contributions made in prior years, there was
    no required funding during the last three fiscal years. In
    fiscal 2009 the Pension Protection Act (PPA) became effective
    and TJX’s policy will be to fund, at a minimum, the amount
    required to maintain a funded status of 75% to 80% of the
    pension liability as defined by the PPA. As of the date of this
    report, TJX had contributed $50 million to the funded plan
    and may make additional voluntary contributions during fiscal
    2010. We anticipate making contributions of $13.1 million
    to fund current benefit and expense payments under the unfunded
    supplemental retirement plan in fiscal 2010. The following is a
    summary of our target allocation for plan assets along with the
    actual allocation of plan assets as of the valuation date for

We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of
    equities and fixed income investments is used to seek to
    maximize the long-term return on plan assets with a prudent
    level of risk. Risks are mitigated through asset diversification
    and the use of multiple investment managers. Investment risk is
    measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly
    investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and
    periodic asset/liability studies.

TJX also sponsors an employee savings plan under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for all
    eligible U.S. employees. Assets under the plan totaled
    $529.5 million as of December 31, 2008 and
    $688.3 million as of December 31, 2007 and are
    invested in a variety of funds. Employees may contribute up to
    50% of eligible pay, subject to limitation. TJX matches employee
    contributions, up to 5% of eligible pay, at rates ranging from
    25% to

F-27


50%, based upon TJX’s performance. Employees hired after
    February 1, 2006 are eligible for participation in the
    401(k) plan with an enhanced matching formula beginning five
    years after hire date. TJX contributed $8.6 million in
    fiscal 2009, $10.2 million in fiscal 2008 and
    $11.4 million in fiscal 2007 to the 401(k) plan. Employees
    cannot invest their contributions in the TJX stock fund option
    in the 401(k) plan, and may elect to invest up to only 50% of
    TJX’s contribution in the TJX stock fund. The TJX stock
    fund has no other trading restrictions. The TJX stock fund
    represents 3.3% of plan investments at December 31, 2008,
    3.5% at December 31, 2007 and 3.8% at December 31,
    2006.

TJX also has a nonqualified savings plan for certain
    U.S. employees. TJX matches employee contributions at
    various rates which amounted to $425,432 in fiscal 2009,
    $1.2 million in fiscal 2008 and $1.2 million in fiscal
    2007. TJX transfers employee withholdings and the related
    company match to a separate trust designated to fund the future
    obligations. The trust assets, which are invested in a variety
    of mutual funds, are included in other assets on the balance
    sheets.

In addition to the plans described above, we also maintain
    retirement/deferred savings plans for all eligible associates at
    our foreign subsidiaries. We contributed $4.2 million for
    these plans in fiscal 2009, $4.1 million in fiscal 2008 and
    $3.6 million in fiscal 2007.

Postretirement Medical:

TJX has an unfunded
    postretirement medical plan that provides limited postretirement
    medical and life insurance benefits to employees who participate
    in its retirement plan and who retired at age 55 or older
    with ten or more years of service. During the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006, TJX eliminated this benefit for all active
    associates and modified the benefit to current retirees enrolled
    in the plan. The plan amendment replaces the previous medical
    benefits with a defined amount (up to $35.00 per month) that
    approximates the cost of enrollment in the Medicare Plan for
    retirees enrolled in the plan at the time of modification.

The company paid $262,000 of benefits in fiscal 2009 and will
    pay similar amounts over the next several years. The post
    retirement medical liability as of January 31, 2009 is
    estimated at $2.3 million, of which $2.0 million is
    included in non-current liabilities on the balance sheet.

The amendment to plan benefits in fiscal 2006 resulted in a
    negative plan amendment of $46.8 million which is being
    amortized into income over the average remaining life of the
    active plan participants. The unamortized balance of
    $29.8 million as of January 31, 2009 is included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of which
    $3.8 million will be amortized into income in fiscal 2010.
    During fiscal 2009 there was a pre-tax net benefit of
    $3.4 million reflected in the income statement as it
    relates to this post retirement medical plan.

Discontinued
    Operations Reserve and Related Contingent Liabilities

TJX has a reserve for future obligations of discontinued
    operations that relates primarily to real estate leases
    associated with our 34 discontinued A.J. Wright stores (see
    Note C) as well as leases of former TJX businesses.
    The balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three
    fiscal years is presented below:

The exit costs related to our 34 discontinued A.J. Wright stores
    (see Note C) resulted in an addition to the reserve of
    $62 million in fiscal 2007. The other additions to the
    reserve for lease related obligations in fiscal 2007 were the
    result of periodic adjustments to our estimated lease
    obligations of our former businesses and were offset by income
    from creditor recoveries of a similar amount. The lease related
    charges against the reserve during fiscal 2007 relate primarily
    to our former businesses. The fixed asset write-offs and other
    charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 and all of the
    charges against the reserve in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009,
    relate primarily to the 34 A.J. Wright closed stores.

Of the reserve balance, approximately $25 million at fiscal
    2009 year end, $32 million at fiscal 2008 year
    end and $43 million at fiscal 2007 year end relate to
    the A.J. Wright store closings, primarily our estimation of
    lease costs, net of estimated subtenant income. Approximately
    $3 million of the reserve at fiscal 2009 relates to 2
    Bob’s Stores locations which are considered probable for
    being put back to TJX by the buyer. The remainder of the reserve
    reflects our estimation of the cost of claims, updated
    quarterly, that have been, or we believe are likely to be, made
    against TJX for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of
    the leases of former businesses, after mitigation of the number
    and cost of lease obligations. At January 31, 2009,
    substantially all the leases of the former businesses that were
    rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted
    liability against TJX had been resolved. The actual net cost of
    the various lease obligations included in the reserve may differ
    from our initial estimate. Although TJX’s actual costs with
    respect to these lease obligations may exceed amounts estimated,
    and TJX may incur costs for other leases from discontinued
    operations, TJX does not expect to incur any material costs
    related to these discontinued operations in excess of the
    amounts estimated. We estimate that the majority of the
    discontinued operations reserve will be paid in

F-29


the next three to five years. The actual timing of cash outflows
    will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are
    actually settled.

TJX may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of
    BJ’s Wholesale Club, another former TJX business for which
    BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable, and on 8
    additional Bob’s Stores leases. Our reserve for
    discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because
    we currently believe that the likelihood of any future liability
    to TJX with respect to these leases is not probable.

N.

Guarantees
    and Contingent Obligations

TJX has contingent obligations on leases, for which it was a
    lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties
    without our being released by the landlords. Over many years, we
    have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or
    guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the
    exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed
    above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned
    leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will
    have a material adverse impact on our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have
    sufficient information about these leases to estimate our
    potential contingent obligations under them, which could be
    triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants
    does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of
    these leases.

TJX also has contingent obligations in connection with some
    assigned or sublet properties that TJX is able to estimate. We
    estimate the undiscounted obligations (not reflected in our
    reserves) of leases of closed stores of continuing operations,
    BJ’s Wholesale Club and Bob’s Stores leases (discussed
    in Note M) and properties of our discontinued
    operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not
    fulfill their obligations, is approximately $100 million as
    of January 31, 2009. We believe that most or all of these
    contingent obligations will not revert to TJX and, to the extent
    they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to
    mitigating factors.

TJX is a party to various agreements under which we may be
    obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of
    warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
    sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
    These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
    There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
    respect to these contingent obligations.

O.

Supplemental
    Cash Flows Information

The cash flows required to satisfy contingent obligations of the
    discontinued operations as discussed in Note M, are
    classified as a reduction in cash provided by continuing
    operations. There are no remaining operating activities relating
    to these operations.

P.

Segment
    Information

TJX operates five business segments, three in the United States
    and one each in Canada and Europe. Each of our segments has its
    own administrative, buying and distribution network. Of our
    U.S. based store chains, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, referred
    to as Marmaxx, are managed together and reported as a single
    segment and A.J. Wright and

F-30


HomeGoods each is reported as a separate segment. Outside the
    U.S., our store chains in Canada (Winners and HomeSense) are
    under common management and reported as our Canadian segment and
    our store chains in Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) are also
    under common management and reported as our European segment.

For fiscal 2009, our Canadian and European segments accounted
    for 23% of TJX’s net sales, 24% of segment profit and 21%
    of all consolidated assets. All of our stores, with the
    exception of HomeGoods and HomeSense, sell apparel for the
    entire family, including footwear, jewelry and accessories and a
    limited offering of giftware and home fashions. The HomeGoods
    and HomeSense stores offer exclusively home fashions and home
    furnishings. By merchandise category, we derived approximately
    62% of our sales from clothing (including footwear), 25% from
    home fashions and 13% from jewelry and accessories in fiscal
    2009.

TJX evaluates the performance of its segments based on
    “segment profit or loss,” which it defines as pre-tax
    income before general corporate expense, Provision for Computer
    Intrusion related costs and interest. “Segment profit or
    loss,” as defined by TJX, may not be comparable to
    similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition,
    this measure of performance should not be considered an
    alternative to net income or cash flows from operating
    activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of
    liquidity.
