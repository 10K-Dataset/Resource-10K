ITEM 1.   Business

     The Company is the largest off-price specialty apparel retailer in North
America, comprised of the T.J. Maxx and Winners family apparel chains, the
Hit or Miss chain of women's specialty stores and Chadwick's of Boston mail-
order catalog.  T.J. Maxx, Hit or Miss and Chadwick's of Boston operate in
the United States and Winners operates in Canada.  The Company is also
developing HomeGoods which operates home fashions stores in the United States
and T.K. Maxx, a new venture in the United Kingdom, which will be a T.J.
Maxx-like business.

     The Company strives to provide value to its customers by delivering
brand names, fashion, quality and price.  During the fiscal year ended
January 29, 1994 ("fiscal 1994"), the Company's stores derived 30.9% of its
sales from the Northeast, 24.3% from the Midwest, 28.0% from the South, 1.6%
from the Central States, 12.5% from the West and 2.7% from Canada.

     The greatest share of sales volume is done through the Company's T.J.
Maxx chain, which operates 512 stores in 47 states, with an average store
size of 27,000 gross square feet.  T.J. Maxx sells a broad range of brand
name family apparel, accessories, women's shoes, domestics, giftware and
jewelry at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store
regular prices.  Hit or Miss, with 493 stores averaging 4,000 square feet in
34 states, is a chain of off-price women's specialty apparel stores featuring
women's brand name and private label fashions including both wear-to-work and
weekend wear.  Chadwick's of Boston sells, through a mail-order catalog,
women's career and casual fashion apparel priced significantly below
department store regular prices.  Winners Apparel Ltd., which was acquired by
the Company in fiscal 1991, is a Canadian off-price family apparel retailer,
which operates 27 stores in Canada.  HomeGoods, a new business the Company
began testing in fiscal 1993, sells domestics, giftware and other home
fashions and operates a total of 10 stores.  T.K. Maxx anticipates opening
its first two stores in the United Kingdom in the spring of 1994.  Unless
otherwise indicated, all figures herein relating to numbers of stores are as
of January 29, 1994.

     In common with the business of apparel retailers generally, the
Company's business is subject to seasonal influences, with higher levels of
sales and income generally realized in the second half of the year.



















     Set forth in the following table are the locations of stores operated by
the Company's United States operations as of January 29, 1994:

Winners Apparel Ltd. operates 27 stores in Canada: 2 in Alberta, 1 in
Manitoba and 24 in Ontario.

HomeGoods operates a total of 10 stores: 4 in New England, 3 in the
Cincinnati, Ohio area, and 3 in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area.


                                  T.J. MAXX

     T.J. Maxx is the largest off-price family apparel chain in the United
States, selling brand name family apparel and accessories, women's shoes,
domestics, jewelry and giftware.  T.J. Maxx's target customers are women
between the ages 25 to 50, who typically have families with middle and upper-
middle incomes and generally fit the profile of a department store shopper.
Over 95% of T.J. Maxx's merchandise is first quality, and the balance
consists of irregulars, samples and department or specialty store over-
stocks.  The chain uses a number of opportunistic buying strategies to
purchase large quantities of merchandise at significant discounts from
initial wholesale prices.  Its strategies include special situation
purchases, closeouts of current season fashions and out-of-season purchases
of basic seasonal items for warehousing until the appropriate selling season.
Pricing and markdown decisions and store replenishment requirements are
determined centrally, using information provided by electronic point-of-sale
computer terminals.  T.J. Maxx employs a disciplined markdown policy to
ensure that substantially all merchandise is sold within targeted selling
periods.

     T.J. Maxx stores are generally located in suburban strip shopping
centers, in close proximity to population centers, and average approximately
27,000 gross square feet.  In recent years, T.J. Maxx has enlarged a number
of stores to a larger prototype format, typically 30,000-40,000 square feet
in size, and plans to enlarge highly successful stores where adjacent real
estate is available.  This larger format allows T.J. Maxx to expand all of
its departments, with particular emphasis on its highly successful giftware
and housewares departments.

     In fiscal 1994, 38 stores were opened, including 20 of the new larger
prototype, and 5 were closed.  In addition, 17 existing stores were expanded
to the larger format bringing the total of T.J. Maxx stores in the larger
format to 128.  In fiscal 1995, approximately 45 new stores are planned, of
which approximately 25 are expected to be larger stores, along with the
planned expansion of 25-30 existing locations.  During the past five years,
T.J. Maxx has opened 211 new stores and closed 7.  T.J. Maxx has increased
its presence in the metropolitan New York market with the addition of stores
on Long Island and in New Jersey.  In addition, in fiscal 1994 T.J. Maxx
opened a new distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina, to help
support its store growth.

                                 HIT OR MISS

     Hit or Miss sells first quality current season women's apparel, and
targets working women 20 to 45 years old who desire up-to-date fashion and
brand name quality merchandise at affordable prices.  Hit or Miss sells
nationally recognized brand name merchandise, purchased directly from
manufacturers at prices below initial wholesale prices, and also sells
private label merchandise, a large percentage of which is imported, in lines
where quality, price and fashion are more important to customers than brand
names.  An aggressive markdown policy is pursued to achieve the turnover
necessary to offer up-to-date fashionable merchandise.  All purchasing,
stocking, replenishment, initial pricing and markdowns are determined
centrally rather than at the store level.

     A majority of Hit or Miss stores are located in suburban strip shopping
centers, with the balance located in downtown areas, town centers and



regional malls.  Hit or Miss stores average approximately 4,000 gross square
feet with an average of approximately 3,100 square feet of selling space.

     During fiscal 1994, Hit or Miss opened 18 stores and closed 30 stores as
it continued with its real estate repositioning strategy initiated in fiscal
1993.  The short average remaining lease life of the Hit or Miss stores
provides the Company the opportunity to close additional stores, if
warranted, in a cost effective manner.  In the past five years, Hit or Miss
has opened 161 new stores, and has closed 174 stores.  Hit or Miss expects to
open 35 new stores in fiscal 1995, and anticipates closing approximately 15
stores depending upon management's review of lease terms and store
performance.
                                      
                            CHADWICK'S OF BOSTON

     The Chadwick's of Boston catalog features first quality, current fashion
and classic merchandise, including career sportswear, casual wear, dresses,
suits and accessories, with a mix of brand name and private label merchandise
priced significantly below department store regular prices.  Through
marketing efforts, Chadwick's continues to refine the look of its catalogs.
In the short term, Chadwick's will concentrate on its existing apparel lines,
expanding large and petite sizes, and including menswear.  Chadwick's target
customers are 20 to 45 year old women interested in moderate to upper
moderate priced merchandise and include both homemakers and working women.

     Chadwick's is continuing to invest in its infrastructure to support its
growth.  During fiscal 1993, Chadwick's completed a major addition to its
fulfillment center and installed a state-of-the-art telephone order system
and an upgraded order processing system.  Further expansion of its
fulfillment center, started in fiscal 1994, is currently near completion.

                            WINNERS APPAREL LTD.

     Winners Apparel Ltd., acquired by the Company in fiscal 1991, is a
Canadian off-price family apparel retailer offering top brands and designer
names at substantial savings.  Winners emphasizes off-price designer and
brand name misses sportswear, dresses and accessories as well as menswear and
clothing for children and infants and toddlers.  In addition, during the year
Winners rolled-out giftware departments in all of its stores.  In fiscal
1994, Winners opened 12 new stores and now operates a total of 27 stores.
Winners entered new markets in the western provinces with stores in Calgary,
Edmonton and Winnipeg.  Winners expects to open 10 new stores in fiscal 1995
and to expand further into new Canadian markets.  In support of its store
growth, Winners moved into a new distribution facility during the year.

                                  HOMEGOODS

     The Company continues to test its new HomeGoods stores, designed to
expand the Company's off-price presence in the home fashions market.  Based
on the continuing success of T.J. Maxx's domestics and giftware categories,
the Company believes an opportunity exists for a chain of large off-price
stores focusing exclusively on home fashions.  HomeGoods offers a broad and
deep range of home fashion products, including domestics, cookware, bath
accessories, and giftware in a no-frills, multi-department store format.
Still in the developmental stage, the Company has refined HomeGoods'
merchandise mix and softened the look of its store layout.  The stores
currently average approximately 50,000 square feet, but the Company intends
to move to a smaller 35,000 square foot prototype with future openings and


has plans to downsize existing locations.  The Company opened 4 HomeGoods
stores in fiscal 1994 and expects to open 3-4 new stores in fiscal 1995.

     The first 6 stores were opened in former Ames locations for which the
Company has assumed lease liability, enabling the Company to test this new
concept at relatively low cost.

                                  T.K. MAXX

     During fiscal 1995, the Company will open its first T.K. Maxx stores in
the United Kingdom, and begin testing the off-price family apparel concept
overseas.  This concept will be similar to T.J. Maxx and Winners, with 2
store openings planned for the spring and possibly 3-4 more in the fall.

                                  EMPLOYEES
                                      
     At January 29, 1994, the Company had approximately 36,000 employees,
many of whom work less than 40 hours per week.  In addition, temporary
employees are hired during the peak back-to-school and holiday seasons.  The
Company has several collective bargaining agreements with the International
Ladies Garment Workers Union ("ILGWU"), covering approximately 3,400
employees in its distribution facilities in Stoughton, West Bridgewater and
Worcester, Massachusetts; Evansville, Indiana; Las Vegas, Nevada and
Charlotte, North Carolina.  Agreements for the three New England distribution
facilities and the Las Vegas facility expire December 31, 1994, and it is
expected that negotiations for new agreements will commence in October 1994.
The Company considers its labor/management relations and overall employee
relations to be good.

                                 COMPETITION

     The retail apparel business is highly competitive.  The Company
generally competes for customers with a variety of conventional and other
retail stores, including national, regional and local independent department
and specialty stores, as well as with catalog operations, factory outlet
stores and other off-price stores.  Competitive factors important to the
Company's customers include fashion, value, merchandise selection, brand name
recognition and, to a lesser degree, store location.  In addition, because
the Company purchases much of its inventory opportunistically, the Company
competes for merchandise with other national and regional off-price apparel
retailers.

     Many of the Company's competitors handle identical or similar lines of
merchandise and have comparable locations, and some have greater financial
resources than the Company.  The Company has relied and will continue to rely
on a strong focus on consistently executing its mission of delivering
exceptional fashion value to its target customers as a means of
distinguishing itself from its competitors.

                                   CREDIT

     The Company's stores operate primarily on a cash-and-carry basis.  Each
chain accepts credit sales through programs offered by banks and others.







                           BUYING AND DISTRIBUTION

     Each of the Company's chains is serviced through its own centralized
buying and distribution network.  Each T.J. Maxx store is serviced by one of
the chain's four distribution centers in Worcester, Massachusetts,
Evansville, Indiana, Las Vegas, Nevada and Charlotte, North Carolina.  T.J.
Maxx's Charlotte distribution center of 600,000 square feet became
operational in September 1993.  Shipments are made twice a week by contract
carrier to each store.  All Hit or Miss stores are serviced by its warehouse
facility in Stoughton, Massachusetts.  Chadwick's of Boston's customers are
serviced from its fulfillment center in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts,
which was expanded in fiscal 1993, with further expansion currently near
completion.  Winners Apparel Ltd. stores are serviced from a new distribution
center in Mississaugau, Ontario, which was opened in fiscal 1994.

ITEM 2.   Properties

     T.J. Maxx, Hit or Miss and Winners lease virtually all of their store
locations.  Leases are generally for 10 years with options to extend for one
or more 5 year periods.  The Company has the right to terminate certain
leases before the expiration date under certain circumstances and for a
specified payment.

     The approximate average size of a T.J. Maxx store is 27,000 square feet,
Hit or Miss stores average approximately 4,000 square feet, Winners stores
are approximately 21,000 square feet on average and HomeGoods stores
currently average approximately 50,000 square feet.  The Company owns four
T.J. Maxx distribution facilities - a 500,000 square foot facility in
Worcester, Massachusetts, a 980,000 square foot facility in Evansville,
Indiana, a 400,000 square foot facility in Las Vegas, Nevada, and a 600,000
square foot facility in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Hit or Miss leases its
334,000 square foot warehouse and office facility in Stoughton, Massachusetts
under a lease expiring in September 1999, with renewal options extending to
2019.  Chadwick's owns a 443,000 square foot fulfillment center and office
facility in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts, with 110,000 square feet of
additional expansion currently near completion.  Chadwick's is also leasing a
nearby 126,000 square foot warehouse and office facility.  Winners leases
257,000 square feet of warehouse and office space in Mississaugau, Ontario.
HomeGoods leases a 30,000 square foot processing center in Milford,
Massachusetts as well as 50,000 square feet of the Hit or Miss distribution
facility.  In anticipation of its T.K. Maxx venture in the United Kingdom,
the Company has leased a 62,000 square foot office and distribution facility
in Yeading, England.  The Company's, T.J. Maxx's and HomeGoods' executive and
administrative offices are located in a 517,000 square foot office facility,
which the Company leases in Framingham, Massachusetts.

ITEM 3.   Legal Proceedings

     The Company is a defendant in a class action lawsuit, In Re TJX
Companies, Inc., Consolidated Civil Action No. 10514, in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware.  The former The TJX Companies, Inc. ("old
TJX"), formerly an 83%-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the directors of
old TJX are also named as defendants in this lawsuit.  The lawsuit alleges
that certain actions of the defendants in respect of the merger in 1989 of
old TJX into The TJX Operating Companies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
subsequently merged into the Company, constituted self-dealing, deception,
unfair dealing, overreaching and a breach of fiduciary duties owed by the
defendants to the then public stockholders of old TJX.  In particular, the
amended complaint alleges that the terms of the merger were unfair and
offered inadequate consideration to the then public stockholders of old TJX.
The suit seeks to recover unspecified monetary damages.  The defendants have
filed answers denying any wrongdoing.  The Company believes that the
substantive allegations of the case are without merit and that the case will
not have a material effect on the Company's financial position.
