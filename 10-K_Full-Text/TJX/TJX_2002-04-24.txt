PART I

ITEM 1. Business

We are the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the
United States and worldwide. We have positioned ourselves as a synergistic
group of off-price businesses and have expanded our off-price concept to new
geographic areas, new product lines and new demographic markets.

We offer off-price family apparel and home fashions through our T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls and A.J. Wright chains in the United States, our Winners chain in
Canada and our T.K. Maxx chain in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We also
operate HomeGoods in the United States, a chain that focuses exclusively on
off-price home fashions, and we launched a Canadian home fashions chain called
HomeSense in fiscal 2002. The target customer for all of our chains, except
A.J. Wright, is the middle to upper-middle income shopper with the same profile
as a department or specialty store customer. A.J. Wright targets a more
moderate income customer.

Our mission is to deliver an exciting, fresh and rapidly changing
assortment of brand-name merchandise at excellent values to our customers. We
define value as the combination of quality, fashion and price. With
approximately 300 buyers worldwide and over 9,000 vendors, we believe we are
well positioned to accomplish this goal. Our key strengths include:

•     expertise in off-price buying;

•     substantial buying power;

•     relationships
with many manufacturers and other merchandise suppliers; and

•     off-price inventory management systems and distribution networks.

As an off-price retailer, we offer first-quality, in-season, name brand
and designer family apparel and home fashions every day at substantial savings
from comparable department and specialty store regular prices. We can offer
these every day savings as a result of our opportunistic buying strategies,
rapid inventory turns and low expense structure.

Due to the unpredictable nature of consumer demand in the marketplace, we
are routinely able to buy excess merchandise from manufacturers and others at
significant discounts from initial wholesale prices. We purchase merchandise
to sell in the current selling season as well as a limited quantity of packaway
merchandise that is stored before sale in another selling season. We are
willing to purchase less than a full assortment of styles and sizes. We pay
promptly and do not ask for typical retail concessions such as promotional and
markdown allowances and return privileges. Our financial strength, strong
reputation and ability to sell large quantities of merchandise through a
geographically diverse network of stores gives us unparalleled access to many
leading consumer brands.

We rely heavily on sophisticated, internally developed inventory controls
that permit a virtually continuous flow of merchandise into our stores. For
example, highly automated storage and distribution systems track, allocate and
deliver an average of 12,000 items per week to each T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
store. In addition, specialized computer inventory planning, purchasing and
monitoring systems, coupled with warehouse storage, processing, handling and
shipping systems, permit a continuous evaluation and rapid replenishment of
store inventory. Pricing, markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment
requirements are determined centrally, using satellite-transmitted information
provided by point-of-sale computer terminals. This



process is designed to achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover and sell
substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods.

During the fiscal year ended January 26, 2002, we derived 88.9% of our
sales from the United States (30.9% from the Northeast, 16.4% from the Midwest,
27.7% from the South, 1.0% from the Central Plains, 12.9% from the West), 6.2%
from Canada and 4.9% from Europe (primarily the United Kingdom).

Unless otherwise indicated, all store information is as of January 26,
2002. All references to store square footage are to gross square feet. Fiscal
2001 means the fiscal year ended January 27, 2001, fiscal 2002 means the fiscal
year ended January 26, 2002 and fiscal 2003 means the fiscal year ending
January 25, 2003. Our business is subject to seasonal influences, which causes
us generally to realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of
the year. This is common in the apparel retail business. We are
incorporating by reference our segment information
from pages 36 and 37 of the Annual Report
under the caption “Segment Information.”

T.J. MAXX AND MARSHALLS

T.J. Maxx is the largest off-price retailer in the United States, with 687
stores in 47 states. Marshalls is the second-largest off-price retailer in the
United States, with 568 stores in 40 states as well as 14 stores in Puerto
Rico. We maintain the separate identities of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
stores through merchandising, marketing and store appearance. This encourages
our customers to shop at both chains.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls sell quality brand name merchandise at prices
generally 20%-60% below department and specialty store regular prices. Both
chains offer family apparel, accessories, giftware and domestics. T.J. Maxx
also offers women’s shoes and fine jewelry, while Marshalls also offers a
full-line shoe department and a larger men’s department. T.J. Maxx and
Marshalls primarily target female customers who have families with middle to
upper-middle incomes and who generally fit the profile of a department or
specialty store shopper.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls operate with a common buying and merchandising
organization and have consolidated administrative functions, including finance,
real estate, human resources and systems. The combined organization, known as
The Marmaxx Group, offers us increased leverage to purchase merchandise at
favorable prices and allows us to operate with a lower cost structure. These
advantages are key to our ability to sell quality, brand name merchandise at
substantial discounts from department and specialty store regular prices.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are generally located in suburban community
shopping centers. T.J. Maxx stores average approximately 30,000 square feet.
Marshalls stores average approximately 31,000 square feet. We currently expect
to add a net of 75 stores in fiscal 2003. Ultimately, we believe that T.J.
Maxx and Marshalls together can operate approximately 1,800 stores in the
United States and Puerto Rico.



WINNERS

Winners is the leading off-price retailer in Canada, offering off-price
designer and brand name women’s apparel and shoes, lingerie, accessories,
domestics, giftware, menswear and children’s clothing. We currently operate a
total of 131 Winners stores which average approximately 28,000 square feet.
Beginning in fiscal 2001, selected stores added fine jewelry departments. We
expect to add 14 Winners stores in fiscal 2003. Ultimately, we believe the
Canadian market can support approximately 180 Winners stores.

Winners opened our first seven HomeSense stores, in Canada, in fiscal
2002. Like our HomeGoods chain, HomeSense offers home fashions. HomeSense
stores average approximately 23,000 square feet. We currently expect to add 8
stores in fiscal 2003. We believe that Canada could support 60 to 80 HomeSense
stores in the long-term.

T.K. MAXX

T.K. Maxx is the only major off-price retailer in any European country.
T.K. Maxx utilizes the same off-price strategies employed by T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls and Winners and offers the same type of merchandise. We currently
operate 101 T.K. Maxx stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland. T.K. Maxx
stores average approximately 26,000 square feet. T.K. Maxx opened 30 stores in
the United Kingdom and Ireland in fiscal 2002. We currently expect to add a
total of 25 stores in these countries in fiscal 2003. We believe that the U.K.
and Ireland can support approximately 250 stores in the long-term. We also
continue to see the European continent as a viable longer-term growth
opportunity for T.K. Maxx that could ultimately support as many as 300
additional stores.

HOMEGOODS

HomeGoods was the first off-price retail chain to focus exclusively on the
home fashions market. HomeGoods offers a broad array of giftware, accent
furniture, lamps, rugs, accessories and seasonal merchandise for the home.
Many of the HomeGoods stores are stand-alone stores; however we also combine
HomeGoods stores with a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls store in a superstore format
that we call T.J. Maxx ‘N More or Marshalls Mega-Store. Stand-alone HomeGoods
stores average approximately 29,000 square feet. In superstores, which average
approximately 53,000 square feet, we dedicate an average of 21,000 square feet
to HomeGoods. The 112 stores open at year end include 71 stand-alone stores
and 41 superstores. In fiscal 2003, we anticipate adding a net of 32 HomeGoods
stores, including superstores. We believe that the U.S. market could support
approximately 500 freestanding HomeGoods stores and 150 superstores
in the long-term.

A.J. WRIGHT

A.J. Wright, a relatively young chain launched in fiscal 1999, brings our
off-price concept to a different demographic customer, the moderate income
shopper. A.J. Wright stores offer branded family apparel, accessories, shoes,
domestics, giftware and special situation purchases. A.J. Wright stores average
approximately 26,000 square feet. We opened 20 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal
2002 and operated 45 stores at fiscal year end. We currently expect to open 30
A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2003. We believe this developing business offers
us the long-term opportunity to open over 1,000 A.J. Wright stores throughout
the United States.



We operated stores in the following locations as of January 26, 2002:

Winners operated 131 stores in Canada: 18 in Alberta, 4 in Manitoba, 62 in
Ontario, 21 in Quebec, 3 in Nova Scotia, 2 in Saskatchewan, 16 in British
Columbia, 3 in New Brunswick, 1 in Newfoundland and 1 on Prince Edward Island.

HomeSense operated 7 stores in Canada, all in the province of Ontario.

T.K. Maxx operated 98 stores in the United Kingdom and 3 stores in the
Republic of Ireland.

The HomeGoods store locations include the HomeGoods portion of a T.J. Maxx ‘N
More or a Marshalls Mega-Store.



EMPLOYEES

At January 26, 2002, we had approximately 89,000 employees, many of whom
work less than 40 hours per week. In addition, we hire temporary employees
during the peak back-to-school and holiday seasons.

COMPETITION

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive. Our
customers focus upon fashion, quality, price, merchandise selection and
freshness, brand name recognition and, to a lesser degree, store location. We
primarily compete with local, regional and national department stores,
specialty stores and off-price chains. We also compete to some degree with any
retailer that sells apparel and home fashions in stores, through catalogues or
over the internet. In addition, we purchase much of our inventory
opportunistically and compete for that merchandise with other national and
regional off-price apparel and outlet stores.

CREDIT

Our stores operate primarily on a cash-and-carry basis. Each chain
accepts credit sales through programs offered by banks and others.

BUYING AND DISTRIBUTION

We
operate a centralized buying organization that services both the T.J.
Maxx and Marshalls chains while each of our other chains has its own
centralized buying organization. All of our chains are serviced through their
own distribution networks.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENTS UNDER THE

PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

Various statements made in this annual report, including some of the
statements made under Item 1, “Business,” Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8,
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” are forward-looking and involve
a number of risks and uncertainties. All statements that address activities,
events or developments that we intend, expect or believe may occur in the
future are forward-looking statements. The following are some of the factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking
statements:

and military actions and consumer demand and preferences;

•

weather patterns in areas where we have concentrations of stores;

•

competitive factors, including pressure from pricing and promotional
activities of competitors; the impact of excess retail capacity and
the availability of desirable store and distribution center locations
on suitable terms; recruiting quality sales associates; the
availability, selection and purchasing of attractive merchandise on
favorable terms; our ability to effectively manage inventory levels,
potential disruptions in supply and duties, tariffs and quotas on
imported merchandise, as well as economic and political problems in
countries from which merchandise is imported;

•

currency and exchange rate factors in our foreign operations;



•

expansion of our store base, development of new businesses and
application of our off-price strategies in foreign countries; our
acquisition and divestiture activities;

•

our ultimate liability with respect to leases relating to discontinued
operations including indemnification and other factors affecting or
mitigating our liability.

We do not undertake to publicly update or revise our forward-looking
statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any
projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.

ITEM 2. Properties

We lease virtually all of our store locations, generally for 10 years with
an option to extend the lease for one or more 5 year periods. We have the
right to terminate some of these leases before the expiration date under
specified circumstances and for a specified payment.

The following is a summary of our primary distribution centers and

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings

TJX is a defendant in four lawsuits pending in the California
Superior Court, each seeking certification as a class action. The
actions collectively allege that all exempt managers in T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls and HomeGoods stores in California, including store
managers and assistant store managers, were improperly classified
as exempt from California overtime laws and seek recovery of
overtime pay allegedly owed, penalties, punitive damages and
injunctive relief. TJX believes that its managers are and were
properly classified and does not believe that the outcome of this
litigation will have any material adverse affect on its financial
condition or results of operations.

ITEM 4.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The information required by this Item is incorporated by
reference from pages 40 through 48 of the Annual Report, under
the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition.”

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

TJX is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on its
investment in its Canadian (Winners Merchants, Inc.) and European
(T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of
our net investment and certain merchandise commitments in these
operations with derivative financial instruments. TJX enters into
derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic
exposure. TJX utilizes currency forward and swap contracts, designed
to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures, most of
which are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity. The contracts
are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are
denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have
performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse
movement in foreign exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts
and the underlying exposures described above. As of January 26, 2002
the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have a
material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

TJX’s cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain lines of
credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect
interest earned and paid by the Company. TJX generally does not use
derivative instruments to offset the exposure to changes in interest
rates on these items. Instead, TJX believes that the use of
primarily fixed rate debt minimizes exposure to market conditions and
the ensuing increases and decreases that could arise with variable
rate financing.

TJX has performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable
rate debt outstanding during the previous year. As of January 26,
2002, the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have
a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
