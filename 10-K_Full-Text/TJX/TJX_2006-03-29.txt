PART I

ITEM 1.      BUSINESS

We are the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home
fashions in the United States and worldwide. Our seven off-price
chains are synergistic in their philosophies and operating
platforms. We sell off-price family apparel and home fashions
through our T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and A.J. Wright chains in the
United States, our Winners chain in Canada, and our T.K. Maxx
chain in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We sell off-price home
fashions through our HomeGoods chain in the United States and
our Canadian HomeSense chain, operated by Winners. The target
customer for all of our off-price chains, except A.J. Wright, is
the middle to upper-middle income shopper, with the same profile
as a department or specialty store customer. A.J. Wright targets
the moderate income customer. Bob’s Stores, acquired in
December 2003, is a value-oriented, branded apparel chain based
in the Northeast United States that offers casual, family
apparel. Bob’s Stores’ target customer demographic
spans the moderate to upper-middle income bracket.

Our off-price mission is to deliver an exciting, fresh and
rapidly changing assortment of brand-name merchandise at
excellent values to our customers. We define value as the
combination of quality, brand, fashion and price. With over 400
buyers and over 10,000 vendors worldwide and over 2,300 stores,
we believe we are well positioned to continue accomplishing this
goal. Our key strengths include:

—

expertise in off-price buying

—

substantial buying power

—

synergistic businesses with flexible business models

—

solid relationships with many manufacturers and other
    merchandise suppliers

—

deep organization with decades of experience in off-price
    retailing

—

inventory management systems and distribution networks specific
    to our off-price business model

—

financial strength and excellent credit rating

As an off-price retailer, we offer quality, name brand and
designer family apparel and home fashions every day at
substantial savings from comparable department and specialty
store regular prices. We can offer these everyday savings as a
result of our opportunistic buying strategies, disciplined
inventory management, including rapid inventory turns, and low
expense structure.

In our off-price concepts, we purchase the majority of our
inventory opportunistically. Different from traditional
retailers that order goods far in advance of the time they
appear on the selling floor, TJX buyers are in the marketplace
virtually every week. By maintaining a liquid inventory
position, our buyers can buy close to need, enabling them to buy
into current market trends and take advantage of the
opportunities in the marketplace. Due to the unpredictable
nature of consumer demand in the marketplace and the mismatch of
supply and demand, we are regularly able to buy the vast
majority of our inventory directly from manufacturers, with some
merchandise coming from retailers and others. Virtually all of
our buys for our off-price concepts are made at discounts from
initial wholesale prices. We generally purchase merchandise to
sell in the current selling season, with a limited quantity of
packaway merchandise that we buy specifically to warehouse and
sell in a future selling season. We are willing to purchase less
than a full assortment of styles and sizes. We pay promptly and
do not ask for typical retail concessions in our off-price
chains such as advertising, promotional and markdown allowances
or delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or
delayed deliveries. Our financial strength, strong reputation
and ability to sell large quantities of merchandise through a
geographically diverse network of stores provide us excellent
access to leading branded merchandise. Our opportunistic buying
permits us to consistently offer our customers a rapidly
changing merchandise assortment at everyday values that are
below department and specialty store regular prices.

We are extremely disciplined in our inventory management, and we
rapidly turn the inventory in our off-price chains. We rely
heavily on sophisticated, internally developed inventory systems
and controls that permit a virtually continuous flow of
merchandise into our stores and an expansive distribution
infrastructure that supports our

close-to

-need buying by
delivering goods to our stores quickly and efficiently. For
example, highly automated storage and distribution systems
track, allocate and deliver an average of 11,000 items per week
to each T.J. Maxx and Marshalls



store. In addition, specialized computer inventory planning,
purchasing and monitoring systems, coupled with warehouse
storage, processing, handling and shipping systems, permit a
continuous evaluation and rapid replenishment of store
inventory. Pricing, markdown decisions and store inventory
replenishment requirements are determined centrally, using
satellite-transmitted information provided by

point-of

-sale computer
terminals and are designed to move inventory through our stores
in a timely and disciplined manner. These inventory management
and distribution systems allow us to achieve rapid in-store
inventory turnover on a vast array of product and sell
substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods.

We operate with a low cost structure relative to many other
retailers. While we seek to provide a pleasant, easy shopping
environment with emphasis on customer convenience, we do not
spend large amounts on store fixtures. Our selling floor space
is flexible and largely free of permanent fixtures, so we can
easily expand and contract departments in response to customer
demand and available merchandise. Also, our large retail
presence, strong financial position and expertise in the real
estate market allow us to obtain very favorable lease terms. In
our off-price concepts, our advertising budget as a percentage
of sales is low compared to traditional department and specialty
stores, with our advertising focused mainly on awareness of
shopping at our stores, and some promoting of particular
merchandise. Our high sales-per-square-foot productivity and
rapid inventory turnover also provide expense efficiencies.

With all of our off-price chains operating with the same
off-price strategies and systems, we are able to capitalize upon
expertise and best practices across our chains, develop
associates by transferring them from one chain to another, and
grow our various businesses more efficiently and effectively.

During the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006, we derived
80.2% of our sales from the United States (29.2% from the
Northeast, 14.2% from the Midwest, 23.1% from the South, 0.7%
from the Central Plains, and 13.0% from the West), 9.1% from
Canada, 9.5% from Europe (specifically, in the United Kingdom
and Ireland) and 1.2% from Puerto Rico. By merchandise category,
we derived approximately 65% of our sales from apparel
(including footwear), 24% from home fashions and 11% from
jewelry and accessories.

We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. The
T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store chains are managed as one
division, referred to as Marmaxx, and are reported as a single
segment. The Winners and HomeSense chains, which operate
exclusively in Canada, are also managed as one division and are
reported as a single segment. Each of our other store chains,
T.K. Maxx, HomeGoods, A.J. Wright and Bob’s Stores are
reported as separate segments. More detailed information about
our segments can be found in Note N to the consolidated
financial statements.

Unless otherwise indicated, all store information is as of
January 28, 2006 and references to store square footage are
to gross square feet. Fiscal 2004 means the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2004, fiscal 2005 means the fiscal year ended
January 29, 2005, fiscal 2006 means the fiscal year ended
January 28, 2006, and fiscal 2007 means the fiscal year
ending January 27, 2007. Our business is subject to
seasonal influences, which causes us generally to realize higher
levels of sales and income in the second half of the year. This
is common in the apparel retail business. In fiscal 2006, we
closed our T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods

e-commerce

website.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls

T.J. Maxx is the largest off-price retail chain in the United
States, with 799 stores in 48 states. Marshalls is the
second-largest off-price retailer in the United States, with 701
stores in 42 states, as well as 14 stores in Puerto Rico.
We maintain the separate identities of the T.J. Maxx and
Marshalls stores through product assortment and merchandising,
marketing and store appearance. This encourages our customers to
shop at both chains.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls primarily target female shoppers who
have families with middle to upper-middle incomes and who
generally fit the profile of a department or specialty store
customer. These chains operate with a common buying and
merchandising organization and have consolidated administrative
functions, including finance and human resources. The combined
organization, known internally as The Marmaxx Group, offers us
increased leverage to purchase merchandise at favorable prices
and allows us to operate with a lower cost structure. These
advantages are key to our ability to sell quality, brand name
merchandise at substantial discounts from department and
specialty store regular prices.



T.J. Maxx and Marshalls sell quality, brand name merchandise at
prices generally 20%-60% below department and specialty store
regular prices. Both chains offer family apparel, accessories,
giftware, and home fashions. Within these broad categories, T.J.
Maxx offers a shoe assortment for women and fine jewelry, while
Marshalls offers a full-line footwear department and a larger
men’s department. In fiscal 2006, T.J. Maxx continued to
roll out expanded jewelry and accessories departments and
Marshalls continued to add expanded footwear departments. We
believe these expanded offerings further differentiate the
shopping experience at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, driving traffic
to both chains and we expect to continue rolling out these
expanded departments.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are generally located in suburban
community shopping centers. T.J. Maxx stores average
approximately 30,000 square feet. Marshalls stores average
approximately 32,000 square feet. We currently expect to
add a net of 50 stores in fiscal 2007. Ultimately, we believe
that T.J. Maxx and Marshalls together can operate approximately
1,800 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico.

HomeGoods

HomeGoods is our off-price retail chain that sells exclusively
home fashions with a broad array of giftware, accent furniture,
lamps, rugs, accessories and seasonal merchandise for the home.
Many of the HomeGoods stores are stand-alone stores; however, we
also combine HomeGoods stores with a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls
store in a superstore format. We count the superstores as both a
T.J. Maxx or Marshalls store and a HomeGoods store. In fiscal
2006, we continued to open a superstore format, in which a
HomeGoods store is located beside a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls
store, with interior passageways providing access between the
stores. This configuration is dual-branded with both the T.J.
Maxx or Marshalls logo and the HomeGoods logo.

Stand-alone HomeGoods stores average approximately
27,000 square feet. In superstores, which average
approximately 50,000 square feet, we dedicate an average of
22,000 square feet to HomeGoods. The 251 stores open at
year-end include 140 stand-alone stores and 111 superstores. In
fiscal 2007, we plan to net 10 additional stores, including 4
superstores. We believe that the U.S. market could
potentially support approximately 650 HomeGoods stores in the
long term.

Winners and HomeSense

Winners is the leading off-price retailer in Canada, offering
off-price brand name women’s apparel and shoes, lingerie,
accessories, home fashions, giftware, fine jewelry, menswear and
children’s clothing. Winners operates HomeSense, our
Canadian off-price home-fashions chain, launched in fiscal 2002.
Like our HomeGoods chain, HomeSense offers a wide and rapidly
changing assortment of off-price home fashions including
giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, accessories and
seasonal merchandise. We operate HomeSense in a stand-alone
format, as well as a superstore format where a HomeSense store
and a Winners store are combined or operate side-by-side.

We currently operate a total of 174 Winners stores, which
average approximately 30,000 square feet and
58 HomeSense stores, which average approximately
24,000 square feet. We expect to add a net of 11 Winners
stores and 10 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2007, in both the
stand-alone and superstore format. Ultimately, we believe the
Canadian market can support approximately 200 Winners stores and
approximately 80 HomeSense stores.

T.K. Maxx

T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland, is the
only major off-price retailer in any European country. T.K. Maxx
utilizes the same off-price strategies employed by T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls and Winners, and offers the same type of merchandise.
At the end of fiscal 2006, we operated 197 T.K. Maxx stores
which averaged approximately 30,000 square feet. We expect
to add a total of 15 stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland in
fiscal 2007 and believe that the U.K. and Ireland can support
approximately 300 stores in the long term.

A.J. Wright

A.J. Wright, launched in fiscal 1999, brings our off-price
concept to a different demographic customer, the moderate income
shopper. A.J. Wright stores offer brand-name family apparel,
accessories, footwear, domestics, giftware,



including toys and games, and special, opportunistic purchases.
A.J. Wright stores average approximately 26,000 square
feet. We operated 152 A.J. Wright stores in the United States at
fiscal year end. In fiscal 2007, we expect to net 8 A.J.Wright
stores, primarily in existing markets to lever advertising and
distribution costs. In the long term, we believe that the
U.S. could potentially support approximately 1,000 A.J.
Wright stores.

Bob’s Stores

Bob’s Stores, acquired in late 2003, offers casual, family
apparel and footwear, including workwear, activewear, and
licensed team apparel. Bob’s Stores’ customer
demographics span the moderate to upper-middle income bracket.
Bob’s Stores average approximately 46,000 square feet
and, at the end of fiscal 2006, there were 35 Bob’s stores
in operation. We expect to open one Bob’s Store in fiscal
2007.



We operated stores in the following locations as of
January 28, 2006:

*

The HomeGoods store locations include the HomeGoods portion of a
    superstore.

Winners operated 174 stores in Canada (including the Winners
portion of a superstore): 22 in Alberta, 22 in British Columbia,
5 in Manitoba, 3 in New Brunswick, 2 in Newfoundland, 5 in Nova
Scotia, 80 in Ontario, 1 on Prince Edward Island, 31 in Quebec
and 3 in Saskatchewan.

HomeSense operated 58 stores in Canada (including the HomeSense
portion of a superstore): 7 in Alberta, 9 in British Columbia, 2
in Manitoba, 2 in New Brunswick, 2 in Nova Scotia, 29 in Ontario
and 7 in Quebec.

T.K. Maxx operated 190 stores in the United Kingdom and
7 stores in the Republic of Ireland.



Employees

At January 28, 2006, we had approximately 119,000
employees, many of whom work less than 40 hours per week.
In addition, we hire temporary employees during the peak

back-to

-school and
holiday seasons.

Competition

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly
competitive. We compete on the basis of fashion, quality, price,
merchandise selection and freshness, brand name recognition and,
to a lesser degree, store location. We compete with local,
regional, national and international department, specialty,
off-price, discount and outlet stores as well as other retailers
that sell in stores, through catalogues and media and over the
internet. We purchase most of our inventory opportunistically
and compete for that merchandise with other national and
regional off-price apparel and outlet stores. We also compete
with other retailers for store locations.

Credit

Our stores operate primarily on a cash-and-carry basis. Each
chain accepts credit sales through programs offered by banks and
others. While we do not operate our own customer credit card
program or maintain customer credit receivables, a TJX Visa card
is offered through a major bank for our domestic divisions. The
rewards program associated with this card is partially funded by
TJX.

Buying and Distribution

We operate a centralized buying organization that services both
the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, while each of our other
chains has its own centralized buying organization. All of our
chains are serviced through their own distribution networks
which includes the use of third party providers at our HomeGoods
division.

Trademarks

Our principal trademarks and service marks, which are T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners, HomeSense, T.K. Maxx, A.J. Wright
and Bob’s Stores, are registered in relevant countries. Our
rights in these trademarks and service marks endure for as long
as they are used.

ITEM 1A.      RISK FACTORS

The statements in this Section describe the major risks to our
business and should be considered carefully. In addition, these
statements constitute our cautionary statements under the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.



Our disclosure and analysis in this 2005
Form

10-K

and in
our 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders contain some
forward-looking statements, including some of the statements
made under Item 1, “Business,” Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8,
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and in
our 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders under “Letter to
Shareholders” and “Financial Graphs.” From time
to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other
materials we release to the public as well as oral
forward-looking statements. Such statements give our current
expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. We have generally
identified such statements by using words such as
“anticipate,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “project,” “intend,”
“plan,” “believe,” “will,”
“target,” “forecast” and similar expressions
in connection with any discussion of future operating or
financial performance. All statements that address activities,
events or developments that we intend, expect or believe may
occur in the future are forward-looking statements. In
particular, these include statements relating to future actions,
future performance or results of current and anticipated sales,
expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of
contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be
realized. Achievement of future results is subject to risks,
uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should
known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should
underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could
differ materially from past results and those anticipated,
estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you
consider forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any
further disclosures we make on related subjects in our
Form

10-Q

and

8-K

reports to
the SEC. The risks that follow, individually or in the
aggregate, are those that we think could cause our actual
results to differ materially from those stated or implied in
forward-looking statements. You should understand that it is not
possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently,
you should not consider the following to be a complete
discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.

Our revenue growth could be adversely affected if we do not
continue to expand our operations successfully.

TJX has rapidly expanded the number of chains and stores it
operates and its selling square footage. Our revenue growth is
dependent upon our ability to continue to expand successfully
through new store openings as well as our ability to increase
same store sales. Successful store growth requires selection of
store locations in appropriate geographies, availability of
attractive stores or store sites in such locations and
negotiation of acceptable terms. Competition for desirable sites
and increases in real estate, construction and development costs
could limit our growth opportunities. Even if we succeed in
opening new stores, these new stores may not achieve the same
sales or profit levels as our existing stores. Further,
expansion places demands upon us to manage rapid growth, and we
may not do so successfully.

We may have difficulty extending our off-price model in new
product lines, chains and geographic regions.

TJX has expanded its original off-price model into different
product lines, chains, geographic areas and countries.
TJX’s growth is dependent upon our ability to successfully
execute our off-price retail apparel and home fashions concepts
in new markets and geographic regions. If the Company is unable
to successfully execute its concepts in these new markets and
regions, or if consumers there are not receptive to the
concepts, TJX’s financial performance could be adversely
affected.

If we fail to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory
management well, our business could be adversely affected.

TJX purchases the majority of our inventory opportunistically
with our buyers purchasing close to need. To drive traffic to
the stores and to increase same store sales, the treasure hunt
nature of the off-price buying experience requires continued
replenishment of fresh high quality, attractively priced
merchandise. While opportunistic buying enables our buyers to
buy at the right time and price, in the quantities we need and
into market trends, it places considerable discretion in our
buyers, subjecting us to risks on the timing, quantity and
nature of inventory flowing to the stores. We rely on our
expansive distribution infrastructure to support delivering
goods to our stores on time. We must effectively and timely
distribute inventory to stores, maintain an appropriate mix and
level of inventory and effectively manage



pricing and markdowns. Failure to acquire and manage our
inventory well and to operate our distribution infrastructure
effectively, can adversely affect our performance and our
relationship with our customers.

Our success depends upon our marketing, advertising and
promotional efforts. If we are unable to implement them
successfully, or if our competitors are more effective than we
are, our revenue may be adversely affected.

We use marketing and promotional programs to attract customers
to our stores and to encourage purchases by our customers. We
use various media for our promotional efforts, including print,
television, database marketing and direct marketing. If we fail
to choose the appropriate medium for our efforts, or fail to
implement and execute new marketing opportunities, our
competitors may be able to attract some of our customers and
cause them to decrease purchases in our stores and increase
purchases elsewhere, which might negatively impact our revenues.
Changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity or
merchandising strategy by our competitors could cause TJX to
have difficulties in retaining existing customers and attracting
new customers.

Unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores
operate could adversely affect our operating results.

Customers’ willingness to shop and their demand for the
merchandise in our stores is affected by adverse and
unseasonable weather. Frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or
rain storms, severe cold or heat or extended periods of
unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect
our sales and increase markdowns.

We operate in highly competitive markets, and we may not be
able to compete effectively.

The retail business is highly competitive. TJX competes for
customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and
other important aspects of its business with many other local,
regional, national and international retailers. TJX also faces
competition from alternative retail distribution channels such
as catalogues and internet sites. Changes in the merchandising,
pricing and promotional activities of those competitors and in
the retail industry generally, may adversely affect our
performance.

If we do not attract and retain quality sales, distribution
center and other associates in large numbers as well as
experienced buying and management personnel, our performance
could be adversely affected.

TJX’s performance is dependent on recruiting, developing,
training and retaining quality sales, distribution center and
other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying
and management personnel. Many of our associates are in entry
level or part-time positions with historically high rates of
turnover. TJX’s ability to meet our labor needs while
controlling costs is subject to external factors such as
unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage
legislation and changing demographics. In the event of
increasing wage rates, if we do not increase our wages
competitively, our customer service could suffer because of a
declining quality of our workforce, or our earnings would
decrease if we increase our wage rates. In addition, certain
associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and
therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions. Further, our
off-price model limits the market for experienced buying and
management personnel and requires us to do significant internal
training and development. Changes that adversely impact
TJX’s ability to attract and retain quality associates and
management personnel could adversely affect our performance.

If we engage in mergers or acquisitions of new businesses, or
divest any of our current businesses, our business will be
subject to additional risks.

We have used mergers and acquisitions to grow our business in
the past. For example, in 2003, we completed the acquisition of
Bob’s Stores. Integrating new stores and concepts can be a
difficult task. We may consider attractive opportunities to
acquire new businesses or to divest any of our current business
segment. Acquisition or divestiture activities may divert
attention of our executive management team away from the
existing businesses. We may do a less than optimal job of due
diligence or evaluation of target companies. Failure to execute
on mergers or divestitures in a satisfactory manner could have
an adverse effect on our future business prospects or our
financial performance in the future.



If we are unable to operate information systems and implement
new technologies effectively, our business could be disrupted or
our sales or profitability could be reduced.

The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our
information systems, including our ability to operate them
effectively and successfully to implement new technologies,
systems, controls and adequate disaster recovery systems. In
addition, we must protect the confidentiality of our and our
customers’ data. The failure of TJX’s information
systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and
operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject
us to liability and thereby harm our profitability.

We expect to continue to depend upon strong cash flows from
our operations to support capital expansion, operations, debt
repayment and our stock repurchase program.

TJX’s business is dependent upon its operations generating
strong cash flows to support our capital expansion requirements,
our general operating activities and our stock repurchase
programs and to fund debt repayment and the availability of
financing sources. Our inability to continue to generate
sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of
availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate
terms could adversely affect our financial performance or our
earnings per share growth.

Consumer spending is adversely affected by general economic
factors that are beyond our control, which could adversely
affect our sales and operating results.

Interest rates; recession; inflation; deflation; consumer credit
availability; consumer debt levels; energy costs; tax rates and
policy; unemployment trends; the threat or possibility of war,
terrorism or other global or national unrest; political or
financial instability; and other general economic factors have
significant effects on consumer confidence and spending, which
in turn affect retail sales at TJX. General economic factors in
the United States and in other countries where we operate are
beyond our control and could adversely affect our sales and
performance.

We are subject to import risks, including potential
disruptions in supply, changes in duties, tariffs, quotas and
voluntary export restrictions on imported merchandise, strikes
and other events affecting delivery; and economic, political or
other problems in countries from or through which merchandise is
imported.

Many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our
vendors and to a limited extent by us in many foreign countries.
Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs,
currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other
factors relating to international trade are beyond our control
and could affect the availability and the price of our inventory.

Our expanding international operations expose us to risks
inherent in foreign operations.

We have a significant presence in Canada, the United Kingdom and
Ireland. We may also seek to expand into other international
markets in the future. Our foreign operations encounter risks
similar to those faced by our U.S. operations, as well as
risks inherent in foreign operations, such as local customs and
competitive conditions and foreign currency fluctuations, which
could have an adverse impact on our worldwide profitability.

Changes in laws and regulations and accounting rules and
principles could negatively affect our business operations and
financial performance.

Various aspects of TJX’s operations are subject to federal,
state or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may
change from time to time. Generally accepted accounting
principles may change from time to time, as well. Additionally,
TJX is frequently involved in various litigation matters that
arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation, regulatory
developments and changes in accounting rules and principles
could adversely affect TJX’s business operations and
financial performance.



We maintain internal controls over financial reporting, but
they cannot provide absolute assurance that there will not be
material errors in our financial reporting.

TJX maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting, but there are limitations inherent in internal
control systems. If we are unable to maintain adequate and
effective internal control over financial reporting, TJX’s
financial performance could be adversely affected. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
and the benefit of controls must be appropriate relative to
their costs.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion contains forward-looking information
and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in
this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the
results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to
various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A of
this report under the section entitled “Risk Factors.”

The discussion that follows relates to our fiscal years ended
January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2006), January 29, 2005
(fiscal 2005) and January 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004).

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 TJX elected to early adopt
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123(R) (SFAS No. 123(R)), “Share-Based
Payment.” This standard requires that the fair value of all
stock based awards be reflected in the financial statements
based on the fair value of the award. TJX has elected the
modified retrospective transition method and accordingly, all
prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this
standard in those periods, based on the pro forma amounts as
disclosed in the notes to our financial statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fiscal 2006 Overview:

—

Net sales for fiscal 2006 were $16.1 billion, an 8%
    increase over fiscal 2005.

—

Consolidated same store sales increased 2% in fiscal 2006 over
    the prior year, with approximately


/


percentage point of this increase coming from the
    favorable effect of currency exchange rates on our Winners and
    T.K. Maxx businesses.

—

We increased our number of stores by 7% in fiscal 2006, ending
    the fiscal year with 2,381 stores in operation. Our selling
    square footage grew by 8% in fiscal 2006.

—

Net income for fiscal 2006 was $690.4 million, or
    $1.41 per share, compared to $609.7 million, or
    $1.21 per share, last year. Both of these years include
    certain items that affect the comparability of reported results.
    The chart below shows the effect of these items on net income
    and earnings per share.

*

The third quarter events include the cost of executive
    resignation agreements,

e-commerce

exit costs
    and operating losses, and hurricane related costs including the
    estimated impact of lost sales, partially offset by a gain from
    a VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement.

We believe this presentation reflects our results on a more
    comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying
    trends in our business.

—

Our pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales)
    declined from 6.6% in fiscal 2005 to 6.3% in fiscal 2006. The
    decline was primarily due to the de-levering impact of low
    single digit same store sales on our expense ratios.

—

Fourth quarter results for fiscal 2006 were stronger than
    earlier quarters, with same store sales that increased 3% and
    pre-tax margins that grew from 6.1% last year to 7.5% this year.
    Approximately one-half of the pre-tax margin improvement was due
    to increased gross profit margins and expense leverage during
    the quarter, with the balance due to the impact on last
    year’s results of a one-time charge related to lease
    accounting. We believe that changes initiated in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2006 to improve execution of our off-price
    strategies, particularly off-price buying, contributed to our
    strong fourth quarter results.



—

We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which
    allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our
    capital investment needs. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased
    25.9 million of our shares at a cost of $600 million,
    which favorably affected our earnings per share.

—

Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at
    our distribution centers, were down 11% at the end of fiscal
    2006 as compared to the prior year end period. This decline is
    largely due to lower levels of inventory in our distribution
    centers.

The following is a summary of the operating results of TJX at
the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an
overview of operating results by segment. All references to
earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless
otherwise indicated. All prior periods have been adjusted to
reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). See
Note A to our consolidated financial statements.

Net sales:

Net sales for fiscal 2006 totaled
$16.1 billion, an 8% increase over net sales of
$14.9 billion in fiscal 2005. Net sales for fiscal 2005
increased 12% over sales of $13.3 billion for fiscal 2004.
Our reporting period for fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks
compared to 52 weeks in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005,
which added incremental sales of approximately $200 million
in fiscal 2004.

The 8% increase in net sales for fiscal 2006 includes a 6%
increase attributable to new stores and a 2% increase in same
store sales. The 12% increase in net sales for fiscal 2005 over
fiscal 2004 reflects approximately 6% from new stores, 5% from
same store sales growth and 2% from the acquisition of
Bob’s Stores, partially offset by approximately a 1%
reduction to the growth rate due to fiscal 2005 having one less
week than fiscal 2004. Bob’s Stores was acquired on
December 24, 2003 and our sales results for fiscal 2004
include Bob’s Stores from the date of acquisition as
compared to a full year for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006.

New stores are a major source of sales growth. Our consolidated
store count increased by 7.1% in fiscal 2006 and 7.8% in fiscal
2005 over the respective prior year period. Our selling square
footage increased by 7.7% in fiscal 2006 and 8.2% in fiscal
2005. We expect to add 105 stores (net of store closings) in the
fiscal year ending January 27, 2007 (fiscal 2007), a 4%
projected increase in our consolidated store base, and we expect
to increase our selling square footage base by 5%.

Same store sales for fiscal 2006 were driven by strong demand
for jewelry, accessories, and footwear, which continued to
generate significant increases on top of very strong results
last year, as well as improved demand for men’s apparel.
The positive impact of growth in these categories was partially
offset by same store sales declines in home fashions and
women’s sportswear. Marmaxx continued its program of
expanding certain departments in its stores and ended the year
with 594 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry/ accessories
departments and 146 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear
departments. These stores had same store sales growth which
exceeded Marmaxx’s chain average. In the United States,
where TJX generates approximately 80% of its sales, same store
sales were strong in warm weather regions, particularly Florida,
the Southwest and California, while flat to slightly negative in
the Midwest and Northeast. Same store sales growth was
positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, which
contributed approximately


/


a percentage point of growth.

Net sales for fiscal 2005 reflected strong demand for jewelry
and accessories, women’s apparel and footwear, partially
offset by weaker demand for men’s apparel and home
fashions. The 5% growth in consolidated same store sales for
fiscal 2005 over the prior year was driven by a 4% same store
sales increase at Marmaxx, our largest division. Marmaxx ended
the year with 303 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry/
accessories departments and 67 Marshalls stores with expanded
footwear departments which were significant factors in Marmaxx
achieving a 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2005. Same
store sales growth in fiscal 2005 benefited by approximately


/


percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates.

We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have
been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal
years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third
fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store
until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which
stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the
beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains
constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We
calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and
prior year on a comparable 52 week basis. Relocated stores
and stores that are increased in size are generally classified
in the same way as the original store and we



believe the impact of these stores on the same store percentage
is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store sales are
calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional same
store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions, because
this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates,
and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their
operating performance.

The following table sets forth our consolidated operating
results as a percentage of net sales:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs:

Cost
of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage
of net sales was 76.6% in fiscal 2006, 76.4% in fiscal 2005 and
75.8% in fiscal 2004. This ratio for fiscal 2006, as compared to
fiscal 2005, reflects an improvement in our consolidated
merchandise margin of .5%. The improvement in merchandise margin
was largely due to lower markdowns at our smaller divisions,
partially offset by an increase in fuel related freight costs.
In addition, the comparison to the fiscal 2005 expense ratio was
favorably impacted by a $30.7 million non-cash charge
($19.3 million after-tax) in fiscal 2005 to conform our
lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting
principles. See Note A to the consolidated financial
statements under the caption “Lease Accounting”. This
charge was included in cost of sales in fiscal 2005 and
increased last year’s expense ratio by .2%. These
improvements in the fiscal 2006 expense ratio were more than
offset by increases in operating costs as a percentage of net
sales, primarily occupancy costs, which reflect the de-levering
impact of a 2% same store sales growth as well as higher cost of
sales ratios at divisions other than Marmaxx, which represent a
greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2006
compared to fiscal 2005.

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a
percentage of net sales for fiscal 2005 as compared with fiscal
2004 reflects consolidated merchandise margins that were
essentially flat to the prior year. Throughout fiscal 2005, the
Marmaxx division effectively executed its merchandising and
inventory management strategies, maintaining a liquid inventory
position and buying close to need, all of which led to improved
merchandise margin at this division. However, this improved
merchandise margin at Marmaxx in fiscal 2005 was offset by
reduced merchandise margin at our other divisions, most of which
experienced higher markdowns. The increase in this ratio in
fiscal 2005 includes a .2% increase due to the lease accounting
charge. This ratio in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004,
also reflects an increase of approximately .2% due to the
absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2005 as the sales volume
from the extra week helped lever certain fixed costs in fiscal
2004. The balance of the increase in the ratio in fiscal 2005 is
primarily due to higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other
than Marmaxx, which represent a greater proportion of the
consolidated results in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004.

Selling, general and administrative expenses:

Selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales
were 16.9% in fiscal 2006, 16.8% in fiscal 2005 and 16.6% in
fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2006 over the prior year is
due to an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of net
sales, reflecting the de-levering impact of the low single digit
same store sales increase. The increase in this ratio was also
negatively impacted by the net impact of third quarter events
including the cost of the executive resignation agreements,
e-commerce exit and hurricane related costs, offset in part by
the VISA/Mastercard antitrust litigation settlement. The
increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a .1%
increase in advertising costs as a percentage of sales as a
result of the inclusion of Bob’s Stores for a full fiscal
year in our consolidated results. Bob’s Stores operates
with a higher advertising cost ratio than our off-price
divisions. In addition, the fiscal 2005 expense ratio compared
to fiscal 2004 reflects an increase in stock based compensation.
TJX has taken various actions to reduce selling, general and
administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 designed to improve
profit margins. TJX also revised its approach to long-term
compensation in fiscal 2006 by substantially decreasing the
number



of stock options issued and increasing the long-term cash
incentive award opportunities, which is designed to help control
the long-term portion of compensation costs going forward.

Interest expense, net:

Interest expense, net of interest
income, was $29.6 million in fiscal 2006,
$25.8 million in fiscal 2005, and $27.3 million in
fiscal 2004. Interest income was $9.4 million in fiscal
2006, $7.7 million in fiscal 2005 and $6.5 million in
fiscal 2004. The increase in net interest expense in fiscal 2006
is due to higher short-term borrowings and interest rates. The
higher borrowing levels were primarily driven by the timing of
inventory purchases, capital expenditures and repurchase of the
Company’s common stock. The additional interest expense
from short-term borrowings was partially offset by reduced
interest costs due to the repayment of $100 million of 7%
unsecured notes in June 2005, as well as an increase in interest
income due to higher interest rates. The reduction in net
interest expense in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 is
primarily due to an increase in interest income in fiscal 2005.

Income taxes:

Our effective annual income tax rate was
31.6% in fiscal 2006, 38.3% in fiscal 2005 and 38.2% in fiscal
2004. The tax provision for fiscal 2006 includes a fourth
quarter benefit of $47 million due to the repatriation of
earnings from our Canadian subsidiary. In addition, during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we corrected our accounting for
the tax impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany
loans. We had previously established a deferred tax liability on
these gains which are not taxable. The impact of correcting for
the tax treatment of these gains results in a tax benefit of
$22 million, or $.04 per share in fiscal 2006. The
cumulative impact of this adjustment through the end of the
third quarter of fiscal 2006 was $18.2 million, all of
which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Of the
$18.2 million, $10.1 million related to fiscal 2005.
These two items collectively reduced the fiscal 2006 effective
income tax rate by 6.8%. See Note H to the consolidated
financial statements. The increase in the effective income tax
rate in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due
to increases in state income tax rates.

Net income:

Net income was $690.4 million in fiscal
2006, $609.7 million in fiscal 2005 and $609.4 million
in fiscal 2004. Net income per share was $1.41 in fiscal 2006,
$1.21 in fiscal 2005 and $1.16 in fiscal 2004.

Net income for fiscal 2006 was favorably impacted by a tax
benefit of $47 million, or $.10 per share, due to the
repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a tax benefit of
$22 million, or $.04 per share, relating to the
correction of a previously established deferred tax liability.
Net income for fiscal 2006 was adversely impacted by
approximately $12 million, or $.02 per share, due to
the third quarter events. These third quarter events included
the after-tax cost of executive resignation agreements,
primarily with respect to our former CEO ($5 million),

e-commerce

exit costs
and third quarter operating losses ($6 million), and
uninsured losses due to hurricanes in the third quarter,
including the estimated impact of lost sales ($6 million),
all of which were partially offset by a gain from a
VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement
($5 million). Operating losses of the e-commerce operation
in the first six months of fiscal 2006 were largely offset by
fiscal 2005 start up costs and a fourth quarter operating loss
in fiscal 2005.

Net income for fiscal 2005 was reduced by $19.3 million, or
$.04 per share, as a result of the after-tax effect of the
$30.7 million cumulative pre-tax, non-cash charge
associated with our lease accounting practices. In fiscal 2004,
we estimate that the 53rd week added approximately
$24 million to net income and $.05 to our earnings per
share. Lastly, favorable changes in currency exchange rates
during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 added approximately $.02 to
our earnings per share in each year.

The change in earnings per share from year to year was favorably
impacted by our share repurchase program. During fiscal 2006 we
repurchased 25.9 million shares of our stock at a cost of
$600 million and in fiscal 2005 we repurchased
25.1 million shares at a cost of $588 million. We plan
to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2007 with
planned purchases of approximately $650 million.



Trends improved in the fourth quarter, with significant
increases in net income and earnings per share compared to the
prior year. Reported net income was $288.7 million, up 75%
over the prior year, and earnings per share was $.60, up 82%
over the prior year. Results for both of these years include
certain items that affect the comparability of reported results.
The chart below shows the effect of these items on fourth
quarter net income and earnings per share:

Excluding these one-time items, fourth quarter net income was
$220 million, up 19% and earnings per share was $.46, up
24%. Results were driven by same store sales growth of 3% as
well as by decreases in cost of sales, including buying and
occupancy costs and selling, general and administrative expenses
as a percent of net sales. The reduction in the cost of sales
ratio was due to improved merchandise margins, with reduced
levels of markdowns at our Winners, HomeGoods and A.J. Wright
divisions being the major factors. The reduction in the selling,
general and administrative expense ratio was due to a decrease
in store payroll and other store costs as a percentage of net
sales.

Segment information:

The following is a discussion of the
operating results of our business segments. We consider each of
our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the
performance of our segments based on “segment profit or
loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before general
corporate expense and interest expense, net. “Segment
profit or loss,” as defined by TJX, may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In
addition, this measure of performance should not be considered
an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating
activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of
liquidity. More detailed information about our segments,
including a reconciliation of “segment profit or loss”
to “income before provision for income taxes” can be
found in Note N to the consolidated financial statements.

Segment profit or loss for fiscal 2005 includes each
segment’s share of the cumulative pre-tax charge relating
to lease accounting. See Note A to the consolidated
financial statements under the caption “Lease
Accounting.” Also, segment profit for the current year and
all prior periods include the effect of the adoption of
SFAS No. 123(R).

Segment profit for fiscal 2006 was positively impacted by the
strong fourth quarter, in which every division increased its
segment profit, or decreased its segment loss, compared to the
fourth quarter of the prior year.

Marmaxx posted a 2% same store sales increase in fiscal 2006,
compared to a 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2005.
Same store sales growth in fiscal 2006 was driven by strong
sales in the jewelry, accessories and footwear categories, while
same store sales for home fashions and women’s sportswear
were below the chain average. Same store sales in fiscal 2005
also reflected strong sales in the jewelry, accessories and
footwear categories as well as women’s sportswear. Same
store sales in both years benefited from the continuation of the
Marmaxx program whereby certain



departments in the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores were expanded.
Marmaxx ended fiscal 2006 with 594 T.J. Maxx stores with
expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 146 Marshalls
stores with expanded footwear departments as compared to 303
T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories
departments and 67 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear
departments at the end of fiscal 2005. These initiatives were
significant factors in Marmaxx’s overall same store sales
results, particularly in fiscal 2005 when sales in the stores
with the expanded departments were above the chain average.
Geographically in fiscal 2006, Florida, the Southwest and the
West Coast all performed above the chain average, while the
Northeast and the Midwest performed below the chain average.

Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (“segment
margin”) decreased to 9.0% in fiscal 2006 from 9.4% in
fiscal 2005. The decline in the fiscal 2006 segment margin was
largely driven by the de-levering impact of a 2% same store
sales increase, which impacted operating expense ratios,
primarily occupancy costs (which increased .3% as a percentage
of sales) and distribution center costs (which increased .1% as
a percentage of sales). In addition, the certain third quarter
events described earlier (e-commerce and hurricane related
losses offset in part by the gain from the VISA/ MasterCard
settlement) reduced segment margin in fiscal 2006 by .1%. The
comparison to the fiscal 2005 margin is favorably impacted by
the inclusion in last year’s segment profit of a
$16.8 million charge for the cumulative impact of the lease
accounting adjustment, which reduced fiscal 2005 segment profit
margin by .2%. Merchandise margin for fiscal 2006 was
essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005 despite fuel related
increases in freight costs. As of January 28, 2006, average
inventories per store were down 10% compared to the prior year
primarily due to reduced inventory levels on hand at the
distribution centers.

Segment margin increased in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004
despite the impact of the lease accounting charge described
above. In fiscal 2005, Marmaxx executed its merchandising and
inventory strategies effectively, which led to strong markon and
improved merchandise margins which increased .4%. Marmaxx also
effectively managed expenses in fiscal 2005. These improvements
in segment profit margin were partially offset by an increase in
occupancy costs of .3% as a percentage of sales, .2% of which
represents the impact of the lease accounting charge. Segment
profit and segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 as compared to
fiscal 2004 are also impacted by the benefit of the
53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period. The
53rd week in fiscal 2004 had an estimated favorable impact
of .2% on the segment profit margin for that year, as the sales
volume from this extra week helped to lever certain fixed costs.

We added a net of 46 new stores (T.J. Maxx or Marshalls) in
fiscal 2006 and increased total selling square footage of the
division by 4%. We expect to open 50 new stores (net of
closings) in fiscal 2007, increasing the Marmaxx store base by
3% and increasing its selling square footage by 4%. We plan to
add approximately 99 expanded jewelry and accessories
departments in existing and new T.J. Maxx stores and to add
approximately 130 expanded footwear departments in existing and
new Marshalls stores.

WINNERS AND HOMESENSE:

Net sales for Winners and HomeSense, our Canadian businesses,
for fiscal 2006 increased by 13% over fiscal 2005, with
approximately half of this growth due to currency exchange
rates. Same store sales (in local currency) decreased by 3% in
fiscal 2006 and increased by 4% in fiscal 2005. Same store sales
for fiscal 2006 were adversely impacted by a decline



in the average unit selling price. Same store sales were also
impacted by lower clearance sales volume, primarily in the
second half of the year, as Winners’ per-store inventories
were significantly below the prior year due to improved
inventory management. At the end of fiscal 2006, average
per-store inventories were down 6% compared to the prior year.
Same store sales were also negatively impacted by declines in
the women’s sportswear and home fashion categories.

Segment profit margin improved by .5% compared to fiscal 2005.
This improvement was primarily due to a 2.9% increase in
merchandise margins which were driven by improved inventory
management resulting in reduced clearance sales and lower
markdowns. The increase in merchandise margin was partially
offset by the de-levering impact of the 3% decline in same store
sales. Expense ratios increased across most categories, with a
1.4% increase in occupancy and distribution costs being the most
significant. Incremental costs associated with three store
closings in fiscal 2006 also impacted segment profit. The
comparison of segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2006
to fiscal 2005 is also favorably impacted by the inclusion in
the fiscal 2005 segment profit of a $3.5 million charge for
this division’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease
accounting adjustment.

The growth in Winners segment profit in fiscal 2005 over fiscal
2004 was due to favorable currency exchange rates. The segment
profit margin for fiscal 2005 of 7.8% was 1.4% below fiscal
2004, primarily due to lower merchandise margins, which
decreased .9% from the prior year, primarily driven by
markdowns. Sales in the second half of fiscal 2005 slowed
considerably from the first half, due to unseasonable weather
and a promotional retail environment. This, combined with
Winners’ aggressive buying based on the strength of its
first-half sales, resulted in excess inventories, requiring the
division to take aggressive markdowns to clear merchandise in
the second half of the year, negatively impacting segment profit
margin. The lease accounting charge reduced segment profit
margin by .2% in fiscal 2005.

The change in segment profit margin for both fiscal 2006 and
fiscal 2005 was negatively impacted by the growth of the
Company’s HomeSense business, which is at an earlier stage
of development than the core Winners business and therefore
operates with higher expense ratios.

We added a net of 6 Winners stores and 18 HomeSense stores in
fiscal 2006, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by
12%. We expect to add a net of 11 Winners and 10 HomeSense
stores in fiscal 2007, increasing our total Canadian store base
by 9%, and increasing selling square footage by 8%. The store
counts include the Winners portion and HomeSense portion of this
division’s superstores which either combine a Winners store
with a HomeSense store or operates them side-by-side. As of
January 28, 2006, we operated 22 of these superstores and
expect to have a total of 29 superstores at the end of fiscal
2007.

T.K. MAXX:

Net sales in fiscal 2006 for T.K. Maxx, operating in the United
Kingdom and Ireland, increased by 16% over fiscal 2005. T.K.
Maxx had a same store sales increase of 1% (in local currency)
in fiscal 2006 on top of a 3% increase in fiscal 2005. T.K.
Maxx’s same store sales in fiscal 2006 were negatively
impacted by a weak retail environment in the United Kingdom, as
well as unseasonably warm weather early in the year.
Women’s sportswear and footwear categories were below the
chain average, while sales of home fashions were strong.

Segment profit margin declined .3% to 4.6% of sales. T.K. Maxx
had an improved merchandise margin in fiscal 2006, primarily due
to lower markdowns. In addition, the comparison of segment
profit and segment margin for fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 is
favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment
profit of this division’s share of the



cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment of
$6.5 million. These improvements however, were more than
offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher cost
for rent, utilities and property taxes as well as the
de-levering impact of a 1% same store sales increase.
Distribution and administrative costs as a percentage of net
sales were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005, despite the
low same store sales increase.

T.K. Maxx’s operating results for fiscal 2005 were
adversely affected by unseasonable weather patterns in the first
half of the year and a highly promotional retail environment in
the latter half of the year. In light of the retail environment
under which T.K. Maxx operated in fiscal 2005, this division was
effective in managing inventories and expenses to minimize the
impact on segment profit margins. Segment profit and segment
margin for fiscal 2005 include a $6.5 million charge for
T.K. Maxx’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease
accounting adjustment. The significant growth in T.K.
Maxx’s segment profit in fiscal 2005 is attributable to the
increase in sales as well as the favorable benefit of foreign
currency exchange rates. The segment profit margin in fiscal
2005 decreased .5% to 4.9%, primarily due to an increase in
occupancy costs of .7% as a percentage of sales, of which .5%
was attributable to the cumulative lease accounting charge.

We added 27 new T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2006 and increased
the division’s selling square footage by 21%. We plan to
open an additional 15 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2007, and
expand selling square footage by 10%.

HomeGoods’ same store sales grew 1% in both fiscal 2006 and
fiscal 2005. Customer transactions and unit sales increased at
HomeGoods during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, but these
increases were partially offset by a decline in the average
ticket resulting from planned changes to the merchandise mix.
Segment profit increased to $28.4 million from
$18.1 million and segment profit margin increased to 2.4%
of sales from 1.8% of sales in the prior year. The increase in
segment profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in
merchandise margin (lower markdowns partially offset by the
impact of higher freight costs), as well as the impact on prior
year results of the cumulative lease accounting charge of
$2.2 million. HomeGoods fourth quarter same store sales and
operating results were particularly strong. The strength of
HomeGoods fourth quarter more than offset unfavorable factors to
segment profit and margin for fiscal 2006, including the
de-levering impact of the 1% same store sales increase,

e-commerce

operating
loss of $3.7 million and approximately $2 million of
costs related to the planned closing of a distribution center.

Segment profit in fiscal 2005 declined to $18.1 million
from $45.4 million in the prior year. The business was
adversely affected by weaker retail demand for home fashion
product as well as an unfavorable merchandise mix, which led to
a 1% same store sales increase. The business also took
additional markdowns, which led to a reduction in its
merchandise margin. The decline in segment profit margin from
5.2% in fiscal 2004 to 1.8% in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to
this reduction in merchandise margin. Segment profit in fiscal
2005 also included a charge for $2.2 million for
HomeGoods’ share of the cumulative impact of the lease
accounting adjustment. Segment profit margin was also impacted
by increases in occupancy costs and distribution center costs as
a percentage of net sales. These expense ratio increases reflect
the de-levering impact on expense ratios of a 1% same store
sales increase.

We opened a net of 35 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2006, a 16%
increase, and increased selling square footage of the division
by 17%. In fiscal 2007, we plan to add a net of 10 HomeGoods
stores (15 new less 5 closings) and increase selling square
footage by 5%, reflecting our plan to slow the pace of store
openings for this division.

A.J. Wright’s same store sales increased 3% for fiscal 2006
compared to a 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2005.
A.J. Wright’s segment loss for fiscal 2006 was narrowed to
$2.2 million from $19.6 million in fiscal 2005. This
improvement was driven by improved merchandise margin, primarily
the result of lower markdowns in fiscal 2006. The comparison to
fiscal 2005 is also impacted by the inclusion of a
$1.7 million charge in fiscal 2005 for its share of the
lease accounting adjustment. In fiscal 2006, effective expense
control also led to a reduction in expenses as a percentage of
sales across most expense categories, primarily in advertising
and store payroll and benefits. We reduced the number of our new
store openings for A.J. Wright in fiscal 2006 as we believe that
the pace of store openings in fiscal 2005 may have been too
aggressive for this young division, placing a strain on
operations.

A.J. Wright’s segment loss grew to $19.6 million in
fiscal 2005 from $2.1 million in fiscal 2004. We believe
that the A.J. Wright customer is more sensitive to economic
factors, such as higher energy costs, and that such factors
along with a weaker demand in urban fashion trends impacted
sales in fiscal 2005. These sales trends caused us to take
higher markdowns to clear inventories and to reposition our
merchandise mix. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 reflected
a reduction in merchandise margins of 1.2%, primarily due to
this higher markdown activity. In addition, the lower-than-
planned sales volume for fiscal 2005 negatively impacted expense
ratios for occupancy costs, distribution center costs and store
payroll. Distribution center costs were also impacted by expense
increases relating to A.J. Wright’s new distribution
facility in Indiana. Segment loss for fiscal 2005 also included
a $1.7 million charge for A.J. Wright’s share of the
cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment.

We added 22 new A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2006, increasing
selling square footage by 17%. In fiscal 2007, we plan to add a
net of 8 new stores (10 new stores less 2 closings) and increase
selling square footage by 5%, reflecting our plan to slow the
pace of new store openings.

Fiscal 2005 was the first full fiscal year for Bob’s Stores
as a TJX division. Bob’s Stores operated 35 stores as of
the end of fiscal 2006. Net sales for fiscal 2006 were less than
the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in the number of
promotional advertising circulars. Although merchandise margin
improved in fiscal 2006 (due to lower promotional markdowns),
the sales decline and incremental operating costs resulted in an
increased segment loss for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal
2005. Segment loss in fiscal 2006 also includes severance costs
of $0.8 million in connection with a reduction in the work
force at Bob’s Stores. For fiscal 2007, we plan to open 1
Bob’s store. We are in the process of implementing new
strategies for Bob’s with the goal of reducing its segment
loss in fiscal 2007.



GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE:

General corporate expense

$

134.1

$

99.7

General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are
those costs not specifically related to the operations of our
business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate
office, including the compensation and benefits (including stock
based compensation) for senior corporate management; payroll and
operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and
budgeting, internal audit, treasury, investor relations, tax,
risk management, legal, human resources and systems; and the
occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the
corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes
the cost of benefits for existing retirees and non-operating
costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual
divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statements of income.

The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2006 over
fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the costs associated with
executive resignation agreements ($9 million) and of
exiting the

e-commerce

business of ($6 million). Both of these items occurred in
our third quarter period ended October 29, 2005. In
addition, general corporate expense includes a charge
($4 million) in connection with an idle leased facility.

The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2005 over
the prior year reflects the change in net foreign exchange gains
and losses, the majority of which relates to derivative
contracts that hedge foreign currency exposures on intercompany
activity. In addition, general corporate expense for fiscal 2005
reflects an increase in general corporate overhead, incremental
audit fees and costs related to the

start-up

of our

e-commerce

businesses.
This increase was offset in part by a $6.3 million
reduction in contributions to The TJX Foundation in fiscal 2005,
compared to fiscal 2004.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Operating activities:

Net cash provided by operating activities was
$1,158.0 million in fiscal 2006, $1,076.8 million in
fiscal 2005, and $767.9 million in fiscal 2004. The cash
generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal
years was largely due to operating earnings. Net income adjusted
for non-cash items was essentially the same in each year. The
difference in net cash provided from operating activities from
year to year was largely driven by the change in inventory, net
of accounts payable, from prior year-end levels. In fiscal 2006
this change in net inventory position resulted in a source of
cash of $26.2 million compared to a use of cash of
$85.3 million in fiscal 2005 and $191.8 million in
fiscal 2004. This trend is largely explained by our average per
store inventory levels at each year-end period. Average per
store inventories at January 28, 2006, including inventory
on hand at our distribution centers, decreased 11% compared to
the prior year and at January 29, 2005 they increased 1%
compared to the prior year. This compares to inventories per
store at January 31, 2004 that were up 11% compared to the
prior year. Effective with the third quarter ended
October 30, 2004, we began to accrue for inventory
obligations at the time inventory is shipped rather than when
received and accepted by TJX. This accrual increased inventory
by $341 million as of January 28, 2006 and by
$237 million as of January 29, 2005 along with a
comparable increase to our accounts payable, and thus had no
impact on cash flows from operations.

The cash flows from operating activities for both fiscal 2006
and fiscal 2005 were also impacted by increases in accrued
expenses and other liabilities in each year. Accrued expenses
and other liabilities increased in each year in part due to
higher liabilities for rent, gift cards and payroll and
benefits. In addition, fiscal 2005 was impacted by an increase
in deferred landlord allowances. Cash flows from operating
activities were reduced by contributions to our qualified
pension fund of $40 million in fiscal 2006,
$25.0 million in fiscal 2005 and $17.5 million in
fiscal 2004. All of the contributions to the pension fund in
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were made on a voluntary basis.

Discontinued operations reserve:

We have a reserve for
potential future obligations of discontinued operations that
relates primarily to real estate leases of former TJX
businesses. The reserve reflects TJX’s estimation of its
cost for claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or are
likely to be, made against TJX for liability as an original
lessee or guarantor of



the leases of these businesses, after mitigation of the number
and cost of lease obligations. At January 28, 2006,
substantially all leases of discontinued operations that were
rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted
liability against TJX had been resolved. Although TJX’s
actual costs with respect to any of these leases may exceed
amounts estimated in our reserve, and TJX may incur costs for
leases from these discontinued operations that were not
terminated or had not expired, TJX does not expect to incur any
material costs related to discontinued operations in excess of
the reserve. The reserve balance amounted to $15.0 million
as of January 28, 2006, $12.4 million as of
January 29, 2005 and $17.5 million as of
January 31, 2004. During fiscal 2006, TJX received creditor
recoveries of $8.5 million, offset by equivalent additions
to the reserve to reflect adjustments to the reserve during the
year. Any additional creditor recoveries are expected to be
immaterial.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 18 leases of
BJ’s Wholesale Club, another former TJX business, for which
BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for
discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because
we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX
with respect to these leases is remote due to the current
financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club.

Off-balance sheet liabilities:

We have contingent
obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor,
which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released
by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous
leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant
number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our
discontinued operations discussed above, we have rarely had a
claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do
not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
We do not generally have sufficient information about these
leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under
them.

We also have contingent obligations in connection with some
assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We
estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our
reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations,
BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed above, and properties
of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the
subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately
$100 million as of January 28, 2006. We believe that
most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to
TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for
substantially less due to mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which we may be
obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of
warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
respect to these contingent obligations.

Investing activities:

Our cash flows for investing activities include capital
expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table

renovations, expansions and improvements and $54 million
for our office and distribution centers. The planned decrease in
capital expenditures is attributable to fewer new store
openings, primarily at HomeGoods, A.J. Wright and T.K. Maxx, as
well as lower capital spending across most other areas of our
business.



Financing activities:

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash
outflows of $503.7 million in fiscal 2006,
$584.6 million in fiscal 2005, and $544.3 million in
fiscal 2004. The majority of this outflow relates to our share
repurchase program.

We spent $603.7 million in fiscal 2006, $594.6 million
in fiscal 2005, and $520.7 million in fiscal 2004 under our
stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 25.9 million
shares in fiscal 2006, 25.1 million shares in fiscal 2005,
and 26.8 million shares in fiscal 2004. All shares
repurchased were retired. During fiscal 2006, we completed a
$1 billion stock repurchase program and announced our
intention to repurchase an additional $1 billion of common
stock. Under the new $1 billion stock repurchase program,
we repurchased 0.3 million shares at a total cost of
$6.6 million through January 28, 2006.

In January 2006, Winners entered into a C$235 million
(US$204.4) non-revolving term credit facility, due in January
2009 and guaranteed by TJX. Interest is payable at rates equal
to, or less than the Canadian prime rate. Winners entered into
an interest rate swap agreement which effectively establishes a
fixed rate of approximately 4.5% on this debt. The proceeds were
used to fund the repatriation of Winners earnings to TJX as well
as other general corporate purposes of this division. Financing
activities also included scheduled principal payments on
long-term debt of $100 million in fiscal 2006,
$5 million in fiscal 2005, and $15 million in fiscal
2004.

We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which
totaled $.24 per share in fiscal 2006, $.18 per share
in fiscal 2005, and $.14 per share in fiscal 2004. Cash
payments for dividends on our common stock totaled
$105.3 million in fiscal 2006, $83.4 million in fiscal
2005, and $68.9 million in fiscal 2004. Financing
activities also include proceeds of $102.4 million in
fiscal 2006, $96.9 million in fiscal 2005, and
$59.2 million in fiscal 2004 from the exercise of employee
stock options.

We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise
requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term
bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper.
In May 2005, we entered into a $500 million four-year
revolving credit facility and a $500 million five-year
revolving credit facility. These arrangements replaced our
$370 million five-year revolving credit facility entered
into in March 2002 and our $330 million

364-day

revolving
credit facility, which had been extended through July 15,
2005. The new agreements have no compensating balance
requirements and have various covenants including a requirement
of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. These agreements serve
as back up to our commercial paper program. As of
January 28, 2006 there were no outstanding amounts under
our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our
U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was
$567 million during fiscal 2006, $5 million during
fiscal 2005 and $27 million during fiscal 2004. The
weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term
borrowings was 3.69% in fiscal 2006, 2.04% in fiscal 2005 and
1.09% in fiscal 2004.

As of January 28, 2006, Winners had credit lines totaling
C$20 million, C$10 million to meet certain operating
needs and C$10 million letter of credit facility. There
were credit lines totaling C$20 million at both
January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively.
The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit lines
was C$4.6 million in fiscal 2006, C$6.8 million in
fiscal 2005, and C$5.6 million in fiscal 2004. As of
January 28, 2006, T.K. Maxx had a £2 million
credit line to meet certain operating needs. The maximum amount
outstanding in fiscal 2006 was £1.7 million on this
line. There were no outstanding borrowings on either of these
credit lines as of January 28, 2006.

We believe that our current credit facilities are more than
adequate to meet our operating needs. See Note C to the
consolidated financial statements for further information
regarding our long-term debt and available financing sources.



Contractual obligations:

As of January 28, 2006, we

The long-term debt obligations above includes estimated interest
costs and assumes that all holders of the zero coupon
convertible subordinated notes exercise their put option in
fiscal 2008. The note holders also have a put option available
to them in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised
and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will
mature in fiscal 2022. The effect of the interest rate swap
agreements was estimated based on their values as of
January 28, 2006.

The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent
and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes and
common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay.
These costs were approximately one-third of the total minimum
rent for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006.

Our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for
merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies
and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for
maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under
executive employment agreements. We excluded long-term
agreements for services and operating needs that can be
cancelled without penalty.

We also have long-term liabilities which includes
$138.7 million for employee compensation and benefits, most
of which will come due beyond five years, derivative contracts
of approximately $100 million, the majority of which comes
due in fiscal 2010 and $133.2 million for accrued rent, the
cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease
commitments in the above table.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

TJX must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We
consider our most critical accounting policies, involving
management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to
inventory valuation, retirement obligations, casualty insurance,
and accounting for taxes. We believe that we have selected the
most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and
that the results we would have obtained, had alternative
assumptions been selected, would not be materially different
from the results we have reported.

Inventory valuation:

We use the retail method for valuing
inventory on a

first-in

first-out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of
inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a

cost-to

-retail ratio
and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is
widely used in the retail industry and involves management
estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory
shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and
timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method,
permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation
when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail
method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than
other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business
practice, we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns
are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management
estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage
rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical
inventory at fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between
actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly
results, but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we
believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined
permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at
each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is
fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with
vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain
conditions, which ultimately affect the



value of the inventory. Our off-price businesses have
historically not entered into such arrangements with our
vendors. Bob’s Stores, the value-oriented retailer we
acquired in December 2003, does have vendor relationships that
provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain
conditions are met. These arrangements do have some impact on
Bob’s inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial
to our consolidated results.

Retirement obligations:

Retirement costs are accrued over
the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate
obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future
and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make
assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for
valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return
assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the
net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate,
which we determine annually based on market interest rates, has
dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on
pension assets for fiscal 2006 and for several years prior to
fiscal 2004 were considerably less than our expected returns.
These two factors can have a considerable impact on the annual
cost of retirement benefits and in recent years have had an
unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension
plan. We have made contributions of $82.5 million, which
exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years to
largely restore the funded status of our plan.

Casualty insurance:

TJX’s casualty insurance program
requires TJX to estimate the total claims it will incur as a
component of its annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are
developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on
historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve
significant estimates and assumptions and actual results could
differ from these estimates. If TJX’s estimate for the
claims component of its casualty insurance expense for fiscal
2006 were to change by 10%, the fiscal 2006 pre-tax cost would
increase or decrease by approximately $5.5 million. A large
portion of these claims are funded with a non-refundable payment
during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual.
The company has a net accrual of $34.7 million for the
unfunded portion of its casualty insurance program as of
January 28, 2006.

Accounting for taxes:

Like many large corporations, we
are regularly under audit by the United States federal, state,
local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes
and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In evaluating the
potential exposure associated with the various tax filing
positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures. Based on
the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we have
appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible
exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which
accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in
excess of reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial
period might be materially impacted. The Internal Revenue
Service has examined the fiscal years ended January 2000 through
January 2003 and several proposed adjustments are under appeal.
We also have various state and foreign tax examinations in
process.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R, “Share-Based
Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) which requires that the
cost of all employee stock options, as well as other
equity-based compensation arrangements, be reflected in the
financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the
awards on the grant date (with limited exceptions). That cost
will be recognized over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award or the
requisite service period (usually the vesting period). TJX
adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and
elected the modified retrospective transition method.
Accordingly all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the
impact of SFAS No. 123R in amounts equal to the pro
forma results presented in the notes to consolidated financial
statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs,” which clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs, and wasted material (spoilage) by requiring these
items to be recognized as current-period charges.
SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred
during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with
earlier application permitted. We do not believe the adoption of
this Statement will have any material impact on our financial
statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
“Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,” an amendment of APB
Opinion No. 29. This Statement addresses the measurement of
exchanges of nonmonetary assets. It eliminates the exception
from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of



APB 29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that
do not have commercial substance. We adopted
SFAS No. 153 in the second quarter of fiscal 2006
which did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” a
replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement
No. 3. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for
accounting and reporting a change in accounting principle. The
Statement requires retrospective application of a voluntary
change in accounting principle to prior period financial
statements rather than recording the cumulative effect of the
change in net earnings in the current period.
SFAS No. 154 also strictly defines the term
“restatement” to mean the correction of an error by
revising previously issued financial statements.
SFAS No. 154 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005 (fiscal 2007 for TJX). We do not
expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 to have a material
effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash
flows.

In June 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue
No. 05-06, “Determining the Amortization Period for
Leasehold Improvements”
(“EITF

05-06”).

EITF

05-06

provides guidance for determining the amortization period used
for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or
purchased after the inception of a lease, collectively referred
to as subsequently acquired leasehold improvements.
EITF

05-06

provides that the amortization period used for the subsequently
acquired leasehold improvements to be the lesser of (a) the
subsequently acquired leasehold improvements’ useful lives,
or (b) a period that reflects renewals that are reasonably
assured upon the acquisition or the purchase.
EITF

05-06

is
effective on a prospective basis for subsequently acquired
leasehold improvements purchased or acquired in periods
beginning after the date of the FASB’s ratification, which
was on June 29, 2005. The adoption of
EITF

05-06

did not
have a material impact on our results of operations or financial
condition.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47
(FIN 47), “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations (an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 143)” was issued in March 2005. This
Interpretation provides clarification with respect to the timing
of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with
the retirement of tangible long-lived assets when the timing
and/or method of settlement of the obligation is conditional on
a future event. This Interpretation requires that the fair value
of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation be
recognized in the period in which it occurred if a reasonable
estimate of fair value can be made. We have determined that
conditional legal obligations exist for certain of our leased
facilities, primarily our distribution centers. The asset
retirement obligation and the annual cost reflected in these
financials is immaterial.

MARKET RISK

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our
investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European
(T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A
and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a
significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations;
intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain
merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations;
with derivative financial instruments. We utilize currency
forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or
losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed
with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in
currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into
derivatives for speculative trading purposes.

We are also subject to interest rate risk under the terms of our
revolving credit line, which has variable rate of interest. The
impact on our future interest expense as a result of future
changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross
amount of our borrowings.

In addition, the assets of our qualified pension plan, a large
portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject
to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We
allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to
minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our
investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European
(T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A
and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a
significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations;
intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain
merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations;
with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative
contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We
utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset
the gains or losses in the underlying exposures; most of these
gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders’
equity. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are
creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major
industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis
assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency
exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the
underlying exposures described above. As of January 28,
2006, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would
not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Our cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain
lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in
interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the Company.
We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our
cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily
fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical
10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum
variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year. As of
January 28, 2006, the analysis indicated that such an
adverse movement would not have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company carried out an evaluation as of the end of the
period covered by this report, under the supervision and with
the participation of the Company’s management, including
the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rule

13a-15e

and

15d-15e

of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in ensuring that all information
required to be filed in this annual report was recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time period
required by the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Company’s management, including its
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.



There have been no changes in internal controls over financial
reporting, that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial
reporting.

(b)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

The management of TJX is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined in
Rule

13a-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
the Company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting as of January 28, 2006 based on the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”). Based on that evaluation,
management concluded that its internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of January 28, 2006.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated
financial statements of The TJX Companies, Inc., has audited
management’s assessment of our internal control over
financial reporting as of January 28, 2006, as stated in
their report which is included herein.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For Fiscal Years Ended January 28, 2006, January 29,
2005 and January 31, 2004

F-1


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of The TJX Companies,
Inc:

We have completed integrated audits of The TJX Companies,
Inc.’s 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial statements and
of its internal control over financial reporting as of
January 28, 2006, and an audit of its 2004 consolidated
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of The TJX Companies, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (the “Company”) at January 28, 2006
and January 29, 2005, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended January 28, 2006 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note F to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company has adjusted its financial statements to
reflect the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment (Revised
2004)” for all periods presented.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
“Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting” appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of January 28, 2006 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of January 28, 2006, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

F-2


A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated financial
statements of The TJX Companies, Inc. (referred to as
“TJX”, the “Company” or “we”)
include the financial statements of all of TJX’s
subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All of TJX’s
activities are conducted within TJX or our subsidiaries and are
consolidated in these financial statements. All intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The notes
pertain to continuing operations except where otherwise noted.

Fiscal Year:

TJX’s fiscal year ends on the last
Saturday in January. The fiscal year ended January 31, 2004
(“fiscal 2004”) included 53 weeks. The fiscal
years ended January 28, 2006 (“fiscal 2006”) and
January 29, 2005 (“fiscal 2005”) each included
52 weeks.

Earnings Per Share:

All earnings per share amounts
discussed refer to diluted earnings per share unless
otherwise indicated.

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements:

In the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2006 we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123(R)), which is a
revision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (SFAS 123). We adopted SFAS 123(R)
using the modified retrospective transition method. The modified
retrospective transition method requires that compensation cost
be recognized beginning with the date of adoption of
SFAS 123 (a) based on the requirements of
SFAS 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the
adoption date and (b) based on the requirements of
SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the
adoption date of SFAS 123(R) that remain unvested on the
date of adoption. The modified retrospective transition method
also allowed companies to adjust all prior periods to the
amounts previously recognized under pro forma disclosures for
all prior years for which SFAS 123 was effective.
Accordingly, all previously reported results included in these
financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the effect of
adopting SFAS 123(R). See Note F for a detailed
discussion of our stock-based compensation and our adoption of
SFAS 123(R).

Lease Accounting:

During fiscal 2005, we recorded a
one-time non-cash charge to conform our accounting policies to
generally accepted accounting principles related to the timing
of rent expense for certain leased locations. Previously, we
began recording rent expense at the time a store opened and the
lease term commenced as specified in the lease. Beginning in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we record rent expense when we
take possession of a store, which occurs before the commencement
of the lease term, as specified in the lease, and generally 30
to 60 days prior to the opening of the store. This will
result in an acceleration of the commencement of rent expense
for each lease, as we record rent expense during the pre-opening
period, but a reduction in monthly rent expense, as the total
rent due under the lease is amortized over a greater number of
months.

This correction resulted in a one-time, cumulative, non-cash
charge of $30.7 million on a pre tax basis
($19.3 million net of tax), or $.04 per share, which
we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of the financial
statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent
liabilities, at the date of the financial statements as well as

F-8


the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. TJX considers the more significant accounting
policies that involve management estimates and judgments to be
those relating to inventory valuation, retirement obligations,
casualty insurance, and accounting for taxes. Actual amounts
could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

TJX records revenue at the time of
sale and receipt of merchandise by the customer, net of a
reserve for estimated returns. We estimate returns based upon
our historical experience. We defer recognition of a layaway
sale and its related profit to the accounting period when the
customer receives layaway merchandise. Proceeds from the sale of
gift cards are deferred until the customer uses the gift card to
acquire merchandise. Based on historical experience we estimate
the amount of gift cards that will not be redeemed and, to the
extent allowed by local law, these amounts are amortized into
income over the redemption period.

Consolidated Statements of Income Classifications:

Cost
of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, include the cost
of merchandise sold and gains and losses on inventory-related
derivative contracts; store occupancy costs (including real
estate taxes, utility and maintenance costs, and fixed asset
depreciation); the costs of operating our distribution centers;
payroll, benefits and travel costs directly associated with
buying inventory; and systems costs related to the buying and
tracking of inventory.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include store
payroll and benefit costs; communication costs; credit and check
expenses; advertising; administrative and field management
payroll, benefits and travel costs; corporate administrative
costs and depreciation; gains and losses on non-inventory
related foreign currency exchange contracts and other gains or
losses; and expense items.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

TJX generally considers highly
liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents. Our investments are primarily
high-grade commercial paper, institutional money market funds
and time deposits with major banks. The fair value of cash
equivalents approximates carrying value.

Merchandise Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the
lower of cost or market. TJX uses the retail method for valuing
inventories on the

first-in

first-out
basis. We almost exclusively utilize a permanent markdown
strategy and lower the cost value of the inventory that is
subject to markdown at the time the retail prices are lowered in
our stores. Effective with the third quarter ended
October 30, 2004, we have begun to accrue for inventory
obligations at the time inventory is shipped rather than when
received and accepted by TJX. At January 28, 2006 and
January 29, 2005, the amount of in-transit inventory
included in merchandise inventories on the balance sheet was
$340.6 and $236.9 million, respectively. A comparable
amount is reflected in accounts payable.

Common Stock and Equity:

TJX’s equity transactions
consist primarily of the repurchase of our common stock under
our stock repurchase program and the issuance of common stock
under our stock incentive plan. Under the stock repurchase
program we repurchase our common stock on the open market. The
par value of the shares repurchased is charged to common stock
with the excess of the purchase price over par first charged
against any available additional paid-in capital
(“APIC”) and the balance charged to retained earnings.
Due to the high volume of repurchases over the past several
years we have no remaining balance in APIC. All shares
repurchased have been retired.

Shares issued under our stock incentive plan are generally
issued from authorized but previously unissued shares, and
proceeds received are recorded by increasing common stock for
the par value of the shares with the excess over par added to
additional paid-in capital(“APIC”). Income tax
benefits upon the expensing of options result in the creation of
a deferred tax asset, while income tax benefits due to the
exercise of stock options reduce deferred tax assets to the
extent that an asset for the related grant has been created. Any
tax benefit greater than the deferred tax asset created at the
time of expensing the option is credited to APIC; any deficiency
in the tax benefit is debited to APIC to the extent a
’pool’ for such deficiency exists. In the absence of a
pool any deficiency is realized in the related periods’
statements of income through the provision for income taxes. The
excess income tax benefits, if any, are included in cash flows
from financing activities in the statements of cash flows. The
par value of restricted stock awards is also added to common
stock when the stock is issued, generally at grant date. The
fair value of the award, in excess of par value, is added to
APIC as the award is amortized into earnings over the related
vesting period.

F-9


Stock-Based Compensation:

For purposes of applying the
provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), the fair value of
options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. See Note F for a
detailed discussion of stock-based compensation.

Interest:

TJX’s interest expense, net was
$29.6 million, $25.8 million and $27.3 million in
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. Interest expense is
presented net of interest income of $9.4 million,
$7.7 million and $6.5 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. We capitalize interest during the active
construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized
interest is added to the cost of the related assets. No interest
was capitalized in fiscal 2006 or 2005. We capitalized interest
of $1.0 million in fiscal 2004. Debt discount and related
issue expenses are amortized to interest expense over the lives
of the related debt issues or to the first date the holders of
the debt may require TJX to repurchase such debt.

Depreciation and Amortization:

For financial reporting
purposes, TJX provides for depreciation and amortization of
property by the use of the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated
over 33 years. Leasehold costs and improvements are
generally amortized over their useful life or the committed
lease term (typically 10 years), whichever is shorter.
Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over 3 to
10 years. Depreciation and amortization expense for
property was $307.7 million for fiscal 2006,
$268.0 million for fiscal 2005, and $227.3 million for
fiscal 2004. Amortization expense for property held under a
capital lease was $2.2 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and
2004. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. Significant costs incurred for internally developed
software are capitalized and amortized over three to ten years.
Upon retirement or sale, the cost of disposed assets and the
related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any gain or
loss is included in net income. Pre-opening costs, including
rent, are expensed as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

TJX periodically reviews
the value of its property and intangible assets in relation to
the current and expected operating results of the related
business segments in order to assess whether there has been an
other than temporary impairment of their carrying values. An
impairment exists when the undiscounted cash flow of an asset is
less than the carrying cost of that asset. Store by store
impairment analysis is performed, at a minimum on an annual
basis, in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year.

Goodwill and Tradename:

Goodwill is primarily the excess
of the purchase price paid over the carrying value of the
minority interest acquired in fiscal 1990 in TJX’s former
83%-owned subsidiary and represents goodwill associated with the
T.J. Maxx chain which is included in the Marmaxx segment at
January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and
January 31, 2004. In addition, goodwill includes the excess
of cost over the estimated fair market value of the net assets
of Winners acquired by TJX in fiscal 1991.

Goodwill, net of amortization, totaled $72.0 million,
$71.8 million and $71.4 million as of January 28,
2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004,
respectively, and through January 26, 2002 was being
amortized over 40 years on a straight-line basis. There was
no amortization of goodwill in fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004.
Cumulative amortization was $33.1 million as of
January 28, 2006, $33.0 million at January 29,
2005, and $32.9 million at January 31, 2004. Changes
in goodwill cost and accumulated amortization are attributable
to the effect of exchange rate changes on Winners reported
goodwill.

Tradenames include the values assigned to the name
“Marshalls,” acquired by TJX in fiscal 1996 when we
acquired the Marshalls chain, and to the name “Bob’s
Stores” acquired by TJX in December 2003 when we acquired
substantially all of the assets of Bob’s Stores (see
note B to the consolidated financial statements). These
values were determined by the discounted present value of
assumed after-tax royalty payments, offset by a reduction for
their pro-rata share of negative goodwill.

The Marshalls tradename, net of accumulated amortization prior
to the implementation of SFAS No. 142 in fiscal 2003,
is carried at a value of $107.7 million, and is considered
to have an indefinite life and, accordingly, is no longer
amortized. The Bob’s Stores tradename, pursuant to the
purchase accounting method, was valued at $4.8 million
which is being amortized over 10 years. Amortization
expense of $477,000, $483,000 and $33,000 was recognized in
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cumulative
amortization as of January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005
and January 31, 2004 was $993,000, $516,000 and $33,000,
respectively.

F-10


The Company occasionally acquires other trademarks in connection
with private label merchandise. Such trademarks are included in
other assets and are amortized to cost of sales, including
buying and occupancy costs, over the term of the agreement
generally from 7 to 10 years. Amortization expense related
to trademarks was $492,000, $492,000, and $519,000 in fiscal
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company had
$2.2 million, $2.7 million and $3.0 million in
trademarks, net of accumulated amortization, at January 28,
2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004,
respectively. Trademarks and the related amortization are
included in the related operating segment for which they were
acquired.

An impairment analysis is performed for goodwill and tradenames,
at a minimum on an annual basis, in the fourth quarter of a
fiscal year. No impairments have been recorded on these assets
to date.

Advertising Costs:

TJX expenses advertising costs as
incurred. Advertising expense was $206.1 million,
$188.0 million, and $148.4 million for fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation:

TJX’s foreign assets
and liabilities are translated at the fiscal year end exchange
rate. Activity of the foreign operations that affect the
statements of income and cash flows are translated at the
average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. The
translation adjustments associated with the foreign operations
are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Cumulative
foreign currency translation adjustments included in
shareholders’ equity amounted to a loss of
$23.6 million, net of related tax effect of
$6.2 million, as of January 28, 2006; a gain of
$8.9 million, net of related tax effect of
$11.0 million, as of January 29, 2005; and a gain of
$21.4 million, net of related tax effect of
$16.3 million, as of January 31, 2004.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity:

TJX enters
into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing and
to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities in the statements of financial
position and measures those instruments at fair value. Changes
to the fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify
for hedge accounting are reported in earnings in the period of
the change. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting,
changes in the fair value of the derivatives are either recorded
in shareholders’ equity as a component of other
comprehensive income or are recognized currently in earnings,
ultimately offset by a similar gain or loss on the underlying
item being hedged. Cumulative gains and losses on derivatives
that have hedged our net investment in foreign operations and
deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges that have been
recorded in other comprehensive income amounted to a loss of
$20.7 million, net of related tax effects of
$13.8 million at January 28, 2006; a loss of
$35.1 million, net of related tax effects of
$23.4 million as of January 29, 2005; and a loss of
$35.0 million, net of related tax effects of
$23.3 million as of January 31, 2004.

New Accounting Standards:

In December 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
(SFAS No. 123(R)) which requires that the cost of all
employee stock options, as well as other equity-based
compensation arrangements, be reflected in the financial
statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards on
the grant date (with limited exceptions). That cost will be
recognized over the period during which an employee is required
to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite
service period (usually the vesting period). TJX adopted this
standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and elected the
modified retrospective transition method. Accordingly, all prior
periods have been adjusted to reflect the impact of
SFAS No. 123 in amounts equal to the pro forma results
presented in the previously reported notes to consolidated
financial statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs,” which clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs, and wasted material (spoilage) by requiring these items
to be recognized as current-period charges.
SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred
during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with
earlier application permitted. We do not believe the adoption of
this Statement will have any material impact on our financial
statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
“Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,” which changes the
guidance in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29 to
eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for
exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. We adopted SFAS No. 153 in the second
quarter of fiscal 2006 which did not have a material impact on
our financial results.

F-11


In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” a
replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement
No. 3. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for
accounting and reporting a change in accounting principle. The
Statement requires retrospective application of a voluntary
change in accounting principle to prior period financial
statements rather than recording the cumulative effect of the
change in net earnings in the current period.
SFAS No. 154 also strictly defines the term
“restatement” to mean the correction of an error by
revising previously issued financial statements.
SFAS No. 154 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005 (TJX’s fiscal 2007). We do not
expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 to have a material
effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash
flows.

In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
of the FASB reached a consensus on Issue No. 05-06,
“Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold
Improvements”
(“EITF

05-06”).

EITF

05-06

provides guidance for determining the amortization period used
for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or
purchased after the inception of a lease, collectively referred
to as subsequently acquired leasehold improvements.
EITF

05-06

provides that the amortization period used for the subsequently
acquired leasehold improvements to be the lesser of (a) the
subsequently acquired leasehold improvements’ useful lives,
or (b) a period that reflects renewals that are reasonably
assured upon the acquisition or the purchase.
EITF

05-06

is
effective on a prospective basis for subsequently acquired
leasehold improvements purchased or acquired in periods
beginning after the date of the FASB’s ratification, which
was on June 29, 2005. The adoption of
EITF

05-06

did not
have a material impact on our results of operations or financial
condition.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47,
“Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
(an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143)” was
issued in March 2005. This Interpretation provides clarification
with respect to the timing of liability recognition for legal
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets when the timing and/or method of settlement of
the obligation is conditional on a future event. This
Interpretation requires that the fair value of a liability for a
conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized in the
period in which it occurred if a reasonable estimate of fair
value can be made. We have determined that conditional legal
obligations exist for certain of our leased facilities,
primarily our distribution centers. The asset retirement
obligation and the annual cost reflected in these financials is
immaterial.

B.

Acquisition of Bob’s Stores

On December 24, 2003, TJX completed the acquisition of
Bob’s Stores, a value-oriented retail chain in the
Northeast United States. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement,
TJX purchased substantially all of the assets of Bob’s
Stores, including one owned location, and assumed leases for 30
of Bob’s Stores locations, its Meriden, Connecticut office
and warehouse lease, along with specified operating contracts
and customer, vendor and employee obligations. The purchase
price, which is net of proceeds received from a third party,
amounted to $57.6 million.

The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations.” Accordingly, the purchase
price is allocated to the tangible assets and liabilities and
intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair
values. The excess purchase price over the fair value is
recorded as goodwill and conversely, the excess fair value over
purchase price, “negative goodwill,” is allocated as a
reduction to the long-lived assets. The purchase accounting
method allows a one year period to finalize the fair values of
the net assets acquired. No further adjustments to fair market
values are made after that point.

F-12


The initial allocation of the purchase price resulted in the
allocation of $2.4 million of negative goodwill. Subsequent
to our fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, it was
determined that additional inventory related obligations should
have been reflected on the opening balance sheet, which
essentially eliminated the negative goodwill. The following
table presents the final allocation of the $57.6 million
purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired based on
their fair values as of December 24, 2003:

tradename “Bob’s Stores,” which is being
amortized over 10 years.

The results of Bob’s Stores have been included in our
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
Pro forma results of operations assuming the acquisition of
Bob’s Stores occurred as of the beginning of fiscal 2004
have not been presented, as the inclusion of the results of
operations for the acquired business would not have produced a
material impact on the reported sales, net income or earnings
per share of the Company.

Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines

The table below presents long-term debt, exclusive of current
installments, as of January 28, 2006 and January 29,
2005. All amounts are net of unamortized debt discounts. Capital
lease obligations are separately presented in Note E.

F-13


The aggregate maturities of long-term debt, exclusive of current
installments at January 28, 2006 are as follows:

The above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero
coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put option
in fiscal 2008. The note holders also have a put option
available to them in fiscal 2014. Any of the notes on which put
options are not exercised, redeemed or converted will mature in
fiscal 2022.

In January 2006, we entered into a C$235.0 million non
revolving term credit facility (through our Canadian division,
Winners), due in January, 2009. This debt is guaranteed by TJX.
Interest is payable on borrowings under this facility at rates
equal to, or less than Canadian prime rate. The variable rate on
this note was 3.96% at January 28, 2006. The proceeds were
used to fund the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian
division as well as other general corporate purposes of this
division.

In February 2001, TJX issued $517.5 million zero coupon
convertible subordinated notes due in February 2021 and raised
gross proceeds of $347.6 million. The issue price of the
notes represents a yield to maturity of 2% per year. Due to
provisions of the first put option on February 13, 2002, we
amortized the debt discount assuming a 1.5% yield for fiscal
2002. The notes are subordinated to all existing and future
senior indebtedness of TJX. The notes are convertible into
16.9 million shares of common stock of TJX if the sale
price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds, if the
credit rating of the notes is below investment grade, if the
notes are called for redemption or if certain specified
corporate transactions occur. The holders of the notes have the
right to require us to purchase the notes for
$391.7 million and $441.3 million on February 13,
2007 and 2013, respectively. The repurchase amounts represent
original purchase price plus accrued original issue discount. We
may pay the purchase price in cash, TJX stock or a combination
of the two. If the holders exercise their put option, we expect
to fund the payment with cash, financing from our short-term
credit facility, new long-term borrowings or a combination
thereof. At the put date on February 13, 2004, three of the
notes were put to TJX. In addition, if a change in control of
TJX occurs on or before February 13, 2007, each holder may
require TJX to purchase for cash all or a portion of such
holder’s notes. We may redeem for cash all, or a portion
of, the notes at any time on or after February 13, 2007 for
the original purchase price plus accrued original issue discount.

The fair value of our general corporate debt, including current
installments, is estimated by obtaining market value quotes
given the trading levels of other bonds of the same general
issuer type and market perceived credit quality. The fair value
of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes is estimated
by obtaining market quotes. The fair value of general corporate
debt, including current installments, at January 28, 2006
is $417.4 million versus a carrying value of
$399.6 million. The fair value of the zero coupon
convertible subordinated notes, as of January 28, 2006, is
$437.3 million versus a carrying value of
$383.3 million. These estimates do not necessarily reflect
certain provisions or restrictions in the various debt
agreements which might affect our ability to settle these
obligations.

In May 2005, we entered into a $500 million four-year
revolving credit facility and a $500 million five-year
revolving credit facility. These arrangements replaced our
$370 million five-year revolving credit facility entered
into in March 2002 and our $330 million

364-day

revolving
credit facility, which had been extended through July 15,
2005. The new agreements have no compensating balance
requirements and have various covenants including a requirement
of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. The revolving credit
facilities are used as backup to our commercial paper program.
As of January 28, 2006 there were no outstanding amounts
under our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our
U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was
$566.5 million during fiscal 2006, $5.0 million during
fiscal 2005 and

F-14


$27.0 million during fiscal 2004. The weighted average
interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was 3.69%
in fiscal 2006, 2.04% in fiscal 2005 and 1.09% in fiscal 2004.

As of January 28, 2006, Winners had credit lines totaling
C$20 million, including C$10 million to meet their
operating needs and C$10 million for their letter of credit
facility. There were credit lines totaling C$20 million at
both January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005. The
maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit lines was
C$4.6 million in fiscal 2006, C$6.8 million in fiscal
2005, and C$5.6 million in fiscal 2004. As of
January 28, 2006, T.K. Maxx had a £2 million
credit line to meet certain operating needs. The maximum amount
outstanding under this credit line in fiscal 2006 was
£1.7 million. There were no outstanding borrowings on
either of these credit lines at January 28, 2006 or
January 29, 2005.

Financial Instruments

TJX enters into financial instruments to manage our cost of
borrowing and to manage our exposure to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates.

Interest Rate Contracts:

In December 1999, prior to the
issuance of the $200 million ten-year notes, TJX entered
into a rate-lock agreement to hedge the underlying treasury rate
of notes. The cost of this agreement has been deferred and is
being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes
and results in an effective fixed rate of 7.60% on this debt.
During fiscal 2004, TJX entered into interest rate swaps on
$100 million of the $200 million ten-year notes
effectively converting the interest on that portion of the
unsecured notes from fixed to a floating rate of interest
indexed to the six-month LIBOR rate. The maturity date of the
interest rate swaps coincides with the maturity date of the
underlying debt. Under these swaps, TJX pays a specified
variable interest rate and receives the fixed rate applicable to
the underlying debt. The interest income/expense on the swaps is
accrued as earned and recorded as an adjustment to the interest
expense accrued on the fixed-rate debt. The interest rate swaps
are designated as fair value hedges of the underlying debt. The
fair value of the contracts, excluding the net interest accrual,
amounted to a liability of $4.6 million, $2.9 million
and $3.1 million as of January 28, 2006,
January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively.
The valuation of the swaps results in an offsetting fair value
adjustment to the debt hedged; accordingly, long-term debt has
been reduced by $4.6 million in fiscal 2006,
$2.9 million in fiscal 2005 and was reduced by
$3.1 million in fiscal 2004. The average effective interest
rate, on the $100 million of the 7.45% unsecured notes to
which the swaps apply, was approximately 8.30% in fiscal 2006,
6.45% in fiscal 2005 and 5.30% in fiscal 2004.

During fiscal 2006, concurrent with the issuance of the
C$235 million three-year note, TJX entered an interest rate
swap on the entire principal amount of the note converting the
interest on the note from floating to a fixed rate of interest
at approximately 4.136%. The maturity date of the interest rate
swap coincides with the maturity date of the underlying debt.
Under this swap, TJX pays a specified fixed interest rate and
receives the floating rate applicable to the underlying debt.
The interest income/expense on the swaps is accrued as earned
and recorded as an adjustment to the interest expense accrued on
the floating-rate debt. The interest rate swap is designated as
a cash flow hedge of the underlying debt. The fair value of the
contract, excluding the net interest accrual, amounted to an
asset of $95,000 (C$110,000) as of January 28, 2006. The
valuation of the swap results in an offsetting adjustment to
other comprehensive income. The average effective interest rate,
on the note to which the swap applies, was approximately 4.52%
in fiscal 2006.

Foreign Currency Contracts:

TJX enters into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts to obtain an economic hedge
on firm U.S. dollar and Euro merchandise purchase
commitments made by its foreign subsidiaries, T. K. Maxx (United
Kingdom) and Winners (Canada). These commitments are typically
six months or less in duration. The contracts outstanding at
January 28, 2006 cover certain commitments for the first
quarter of fiscal 2007. TJX elected not to apply hedge
accounting rules to these contracts. The change in the fair
value of these contracts resulted in expense of
$2.5 million in fiscal 2006, income of $1.8 million in
fiscal 2005 and income of $1.1 million in fiscal 2004. TJX
also enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to
obtain an economic hedge on certain foreign intercompany
payables, primarily license fees, for which we elected not to
apply hedge accounting rules. There were no such contracts
outstanding at January 28, 2006. The change in fair value
of these contracts resulted in expense of $54,000 in fiscal
2006, income of $1.9 million in fiscal 2005 and expense of
$1 million in fiscal 2004. The gain or loss on these
contracts is ultimately offset by a similar gain or loss on the
underlying item being hedged.

F-15


TJX also enters into foreign currency forward and swap contracts
in both Canadian dollars and British pound sterling and accounts
for them as either a hedge of the net investment in and between
our foreign subsidiaries or as a cash flow hedge of certain
long-term intercompany debt. We apply hedge accounting to these
hedge contracts of our investment in foreign operations, and
changes in fair value of these contracts, as well as gains and
losses upon settlement, are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income, offsetting changes in the cumulative
foreign translation adjustments of our foreign divisions. The
change in fair value of the contracts designated as a hedge of
our investment in foreign operations resulted in a gain of
$15.0 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2006, a gain
of $3.8 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2005, and a
loss of $24.7 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2004.
The change in the cumulative foreign currency translation
adjustment resulted in a loss of $32.6 million, net of
income taxes, in fiscal 2006, a loss of $10.7 million, net
of income taxes, in fiscal 2005, and a gain of
$14.3 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2004. Amounts
included in other comprehensive income relating to cash flow
hedges are reclassified to earnings as the currency exposure on
the underlying intercompany debt impacts earnings. The net loss
recognized in fiscal 2006 related to cash flow forward exchange
contracts and related underlying activity was
$13.8 million, net of income taxes. This amount was offset
by a non-taxable gain of $22.5 million related to the
underlying exposure and is also included as component of
selling, general and administrative expenses in the statement of
income. The net loss recognized in fiscal 2005 related to cash
flow forward exchange contracts and related underlying activity
was $13.9 million, net of income taxes, this amount was
offset by a gain of $11.9 million, net of income taxes,
related to the underlying exposure and is also included as
component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the
statement of income. We estimate that $4.6 million of
losses, net of income taxes, deferred in accumulated other
comprehensive income will be recognized in earnings over the
next twelve months.

TJX also enters into derivative contracts, generally designated
as fair value hedges, to hedge intercompany debt and
intercompany interest payable. The changes in fair value of
these contracts are recorded in the statements of income and are
offset by marking the underlying item to fair value in the same
period. Upon settlement, the realized gains and losses on these
contracts are offset by the realized gains and losses of the
underlying item in the statement of income. The net impact of
hedging activity related to these intercompany payables resulted
in income of $318,000, in fiscal 2006 and expense of
$2.2 million and $1.6 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

The value of foreign currency exchange contracts relating to
inventory commitments is reported in current earnings as a
component of cost of sales, including buying and occupancy
costs. The income statement impact of all other foreign currency
contracts is reported as a component of selling, general and
administrative expenses.

TJX’s forward foreign currency exchange and swap contracts
require us to make payments of certain foreign currencies or
U.S. dollars for receipt of Canadian dollars,
U.S. dollars or Euros. All of these contracts except the
contracts relating to our investment in our foreign operations
and long-term debt mature during fiscal 2007. The British pound
sterling investment hedges have maturities from fiscal 2007 to
fiscal 2009, the Canadian dollar investment hedge contracts and
long-term debt hedge contracts have maturities from fiscal 2007
to fiscal 2010.

The counterparties to the forward exchange contracts and swap
agreements are major international financial institutions and
the contracts contain rights of offset, which minimize our
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by one of
the counterparties. We do not require counterparties to maintain
collateral for these contracts. We periodically monitor our
position and the credit ratings of the counterparties and do not
anticipate losses resulting from the nonperformance of these
institutions.

E.       Commitments

TJX is committed under long-term leases related to its
continuing operations for the rental of real estate and fixtures
and equipment. Most of our leases are store operating leases
with a ten-year initial term and options to extend for one or
more five-year periods. Certain Marshalls leases, acquired in
fiscal 1996, had remaining terms ranging up to

F-17


twenty-five years. Leases for T.K. Maxx are generally for
fifteen to twenty-five years with ten-year kick-out options.
Many of the leases contain escalation clauses and early
termination penalties. In addition, we are generally required to
pay insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses
including, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of
sales. These costs were of an amount equal to approximately
one-third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended
January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively.

Following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for
continuing operations as of January 28, 2006:

The capital lease commitment relates to a

283,000-square

-foot
addition to TJX’s home office facility. Rental payments
commenced June 1, 2001, and we recognized a capital lease
asset and related obligation equal to the present value of the
lease payments of $32.6 million.

Rental expense under operating leases for continuing operations
amounted to $774.9 million, $713.3 million, and
$597.8 million for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Rental expense includes contingent rent and is
reported net of sublease income. Contingent rent paid was
$7.1 million, $6.9 million, and $8.6 million in
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively; and sublease income
was $3.0 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. The total
net present value of TJX’s minimum operating lease
obligations approximates $4,020.7 million as of
January 28, 2006.

TJX had outstanding letters of credit totaling
$39.9 million as of January 28, 2006 and
$52.1 million as of January 29, 2005. Letters of
credit are issued by TJX primarily for the purchase of inventory.

F.       Stock
Compensation Plans

In November 2005, we adopted SFAS 123(R), which is a
revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123(R) supersedes
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, and amends
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95,
“Statement of Cash Flows”.

We adopted SFAS 123(R) using the “modified
retrospective” transition method. The modified
retrospective transition method requires that compensation cost
be recognized beginning with the date of adoption of
SFAS 123 (a) based on the requirements of
SFAS 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the
adoption date and (b) based on the requirements of
SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the
adoption date of SFAS 123(R) that remain unvested on the
date of adoption. The modified retrospective transition method
also allowed companies to adjust prior periods based on the
amounts previously recognized under SFAS 123 for purposes
of pro forma disclosures for all prior years of which
SFAS 123 was effective. Accordingly, we adjusted our
January 25, 2003 Consolidated Statements of
Shareholders’ Equity to increase “Retained
earnings” by $53.0 million, and established a deferred
tax asset for the same amount.

By using the modified retrospective transition method to adopt
SFAS 123(R), we adjusted the amount of excess tax benefits
we had previously recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Our accounting under SFAS 123(R) may affect our ability to
fully realize the value shown on our balance sheet of deferred
tax assets associated with compensation expense. Full
realization of these deferred tax assets requires stock options
to be exercised at a price equaling or exceeding the sum of the
strike price plus the fair value of the option at the grant
date. The provisions of SFAS 123(R)

F-18


do not allow a valuation allowance to be recorded unless the
company’s future taxable income is expected to be
insufficient to recover the asset. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the current stock price of our common shares will
rise to levels sufficient to realize the entire tax benefit
currently reflected in our balance sheet. However, to the extent
that additional tax benefits are generated in excess of the
deferred taxes associated with compensation expense previously
recognized, the potential future impact on income would be
reduced.

When the tax deduction exceeds the compensation cost resulting
from the exercise of options, a tax benefit is created. Prior to
the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we presented all such tax
benefits as operating cash flows on our Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows. SFAS 123(R) requires that cash flows
resulting from such tax benefits be classified as financing cash
flows. Accordingly $3.0 million and $2.6 million of
operating cash inflows have been reclassified to cash inflows
from financing activity in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.
There were no such excess tax benefits in fiscal 2006.

The total compensation cost related to stock based compensation
was $58.9 million net of income taxes of $32.3 million, in
fiscal 2006, $60.1 million, net of income taxes of $40.0
million, in fiscal 2005, and $55.2 million, net of income
taxes of $36.6 million, in fiscal 2004.

TJX has a stock incentive plan under which options and other
stock awards may be granted to its directors, officers and key
employees. This plan has been approved by TJX’s
shareholders and all stock compensation awards are made under
this plan. The Stock Incentive Plan, as amended with shareholder
approval, provides for the issuance of up to 145.3 million
shares with 27.2 million shares available for future grants
as of January 28, 2006. TJX issues shares from previously
authorized but unissued common stock. On December 6, 2005, the
Board of Directors of TJX determined that beginning in fiscal
2007, non-employee directors would no longer be awarded stock
option grants under the Stock Incentive Plan, and the plan was
amended to eliminate such awards.

Under the Stock Incentive Plan, TJX has granted options for the
purchase of common stock, generally within ten years from the
grant date at option prices of 100% of market price on the grant
date. Most options outstanding vest over a three-year period
starting one year after the grant, and are exercisable in their
entirety three years after the grant date. Options granted to
directors become fully exercisable one year after the date of
grant.

For purposes of applying the provisions of
SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 123(R), the fair
value of each option granted during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004
is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following assumptions:

Expected volatility is based on a combination of implied
volatility from traded options on our stock, and historical
volatility during a term approximating the expected term of the
option granted. We use historical data to estimate option
exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation
model. Separate employee groups and option characteristics are
considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected
option life represents an estimate of the period of time options
are expected to remain outstanding based upon historical
exercise trends. The risk free rate is for periods within the
contractual life of the option based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.

As of January 28, 2006, there was $116.0 million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan.
That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of 1.8 years. The total fair value of shares vested
in fiscal 2006 was $93.5 million.

Restricted Stock Pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan:

TJX has also issued restricted stock and performance-based stock
awards under the Stock Incentive Plan. Restricted stock awards
are issued at no cost to the recipient of the award, and have
service restrictions that generally lapse over three to four
years from date of grant. Performance-based shares have
restrictions that generally lapse over one to four years when
and if specified performance criteria are met. The grant date
fair value of the award is charged to income ratably over the
period during which these awards vest. Such

pre-tax

charges
amounted to $7.2 million, $9.4 million and
$10.2 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The fair value of the awards is determined at date of grant and
assumes that performance goals will be achieved. If such goals
are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any
recognized compensation cost is reversed.

A combined total of 377,000 shares, 220,000 shares and
600,000 shares for restricted and performance-based awards
were issued in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
18,750 shares were forfeited during fiscal 2006. No shares

F-20


were forfeited during fiscal 2005 or 2004. The weighted average
market value per share of these stock awards at grant date was
$21.14, $22.37 and $19.16 for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

In November 2005, we issued a market based deferred share award
to our chief executive officer which is indexed to our stock
price for a sixty-day period in fiscal 2007 (“measurement
period”) whereby the executive can earn up to
94,000 shares of TJX stock. The weighted average grant
date fair value of this award was $9.90 per share.

TJX maintained a separate deferred stock compensation plan for
its outside directors under which deferred share awards valued
at $10,000 each were issued annually to outside directors.
During fiscal 2003, the Board merged this deferred stock
compensation plan into the Stock Incentive Plan, and all
deferred shares earned will be issued pursuant to the Stock
Incentive Plan. Beginning in June 2003, the annual deferred
share award granted to each outside director is valued at
$30,000. As of the end of fiscal 2006, a total of 80,814
deferred shares had been granted under the plan. Actual shares
will be issued at termination of service or a change of control.
Prior to merging the deferred stock award plan into the Stock
Incentive Plan, TJX planned to issue actual shares from shares
held in treasury. At January 28, 2006, no shares are held
in treasury related to this plan.

G.       Capital Stock and
Earnings Per Share

Capital Stock:

During fiscal 2005, we completed a
$1 billion stock repurchase program begun in fiscal 2003
and initiated another multi-year $1 billion stock
repurchase program. This repurchase program was completed in
January 2006. In October 2005, we announced a new stock
repurchase program, approved by the Board of Directors, pursuant
to which we may repurchase up to an additional $1 billion
of common stock. We had cash expenditures under all of our
repurchase programs of $603.7 million, $594.6 million
and $520.7 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, funded primarily by cash generated from
operations. The total common shares repurchased amounted to
25.9 million shares in fiscal 2006, 25.1 million
shares in fiscal 2005 and 26.8 million shares in fiscal
2004. As of January 28, 2006, we had repurchased
268,298 shares of our common stock at a cost of
$6.6 million under the current $1 billion stock
repurchase program. All shares repurchased under our stock
repurchase programs have been retired.

TJX has authorization to issue up to 5 million shares of
preferred stock, par value $1. There was no preferred stock
issued or outstanding at January 28, 2006.

Earnings Per Share:

In October 2004, the Emerging Issues
Task Force (“EITF”) of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) reached a consensus that EITF
Issue No.

04-08,

“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted
Earnings per Share” would be effective for reporting
periods ending after December 15, 2004. This accounting
pronouncement affects the company’s treatment, for earnings
per share purposes, of its $517.5 million zero coupon
convertible subordinated notes issued in February 2001. The
notes are convertible into 16.9 million shares of
TJX common stock if the sale price of our stock reaches
certain levels or other contingencies are met. Prior to this
reporting period, the 16.9 million shares were excluded
from the diluted earnings per share calculation because criteria
for conversion had not been met. EITF Issue
No.

04-08

requires
that shares associated with contingently convertible debt be
included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless
of whether contingent conversion conditions have been met. EITF
Issue No.

04-08

also requires that diluted earnings per share for all prior
periods be adjusted to reflect this change. As a result, diluted
earnings per share for all periods presented reflect the assumed
conversion of our convertible subordinated notes.

F-21


The following schedule presents the calculation of basic and
diluted earnings per share for income from continuing operations:

The weighted average common shares for the diluted earnings per
share calculation exclude the incremental effect related to
outstanding stock options, the exercise price of which is in
excess of the related fiscal year’s average price of
TJX’s common stock. Such options are excluded because they
would have an antidilutive effect. There were 190,800 and
22.7 million such options excluded as of January 28,
2006 and January 31, 2004, respectively. No such options
were excluded as of January 29, 2005.

H.       Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes the following:

F-22


TJX had net deferred tax (liabilities) as follows:

The fiscal 2006 total net deferred tax asset is presented on the
balance sheet as a current asset of $9.2 million and a
non-current asset of $6.4 million. For fiscal 2005, the net
deferred tax liability is presented on the balance sheet as a
current liability of $2.3 million and a non-current
liability of $59.5 million. TJX has distributed all of the
earnings from its Canadian subsidiary through January 28,
2006 and therefore no U.S. deferred income taxes remain as
of January 28, 2006. All earnings of TJX’s other
foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested and no deferred
taxes have been provided on those earnings. The net deferred tax
asset (liability) summarized above includes deferred taxes
relating to temporary differences at our foreign operations and
amounted to $22.1 million net liability as of
January 28, 2006 and $31.0 million net liability as of
January 29, 2005.

Tax legislation enacted in 2004, allowed companies to repatriate
the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations in fiscal
2006 at an effective U.S. Federal income tax rate of 5.25%.
TJX recognized a one-time tax benefit of $47 million, or
$.10 per share, from the repatriation of
U.S. $259.5 million of Canadian earnings during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. In addition, during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2006 TJX corrected its accounting for the tax
impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans.
We had previously established a deferred tax liability on these
gains which are not taxable. The impact of correcting for the
tax treatment of these gains results in a tax benefit of
$22 million. The cumulative impact of this adjustment
through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was
$18.2 million, all of which was recorded in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2006. Of the $18.2 million,
$10.1 million related to fiscal 2005.

In fiscal 2006, TJX utilized a United Kingdom net operating loss
carryforward of approximately $2.4 million. As of
January 28, 2006, there are no United Kingdom net operating
loss carryforwards.

F-23


TJX’s worldwide effective income tax rate was 31.6% for
fiscal 2006, 38.3% for fiscal 2005 and 38.2% for fiscal 2004.

I.       Pension Plans and
Other Retirement Benefits

Pension:

TJX has a funded defined benefit retirement plan
covering the majority of its full-time U.S. employees.
Employees who have attained twenty-one years of age and have
completed one year of service are covered under the plan. No
employee contributions are required and benefits are based on
compensation earned in each year of service. Effective
February 1, 2006, new employees will not participate in
this plan but will be eligible to receive enhanced employer
contributions to their 401(k) plans. This plan amendment will
not have an impact on fiscal 2007 pension expense, but will
result in savings in future years. We also have an unfunded
supplemental retirement plan which covers key employees of the
Company and provides additional retirement benefits based on
average compensation. Our funded defined benefit retirement plan
assets are invested primarily in stock and bonds of
U.S. corporations, excluding TJX, as well as various
investment funds.

Presented below is financial information relating to TJX’s
funded defined benefit retirement plan (Funded Plan) and its
unfunded supplemental pension plan (Unfunded Plan) for the
fiscal years indicated. The valuation date for both plans is as
of December 31 prior to the fiscal year end date:

F-24


The net asset attributable to the funded plan is reflected on
the balance sheets as a non-current asset of $25.6 million
and a current asset of $38.5 million as of January 28,
2006 and a non-current asset of $26.1 million and a current
asset of $32.9 million as of January 29, 2005. The net
accrued liability attributable to TJX’s unfunded
supplemental retirement plan is included in other long-term
liabilities on the balance sheets.

We made aggregate cash contributions of $42.0 million,
$27.2 million and $19.7 million for fiscal 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively, to the defined benefit retirement plan
and to fund current benefit and expense payments under the
unfunded supplemental retirement plan. Our funding policy is to
fund any required contribution to the plan at the full funding
limitation. Contributions in excess of any required contribution
will be made so as to fully fund the accumulated benefit
obligation to the extent such contribution is allowed for tax
purposes. As a result of voluntary funding contributions made in
fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, we do not anticipate
any funding requirements for fiscal

2007. The following is a summary of our target allocation for

We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of
equities and fixed income investments is used to maximize the
long-term return of plan assets with a prudent level of risk.
Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of
plan liabilities, funded plan status, and corporate financial
condition. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend
of equity and fixed income investments. Furthermore, equity
investments are diversified across U.S. and

non-U.S.

stocks,
as well as small and large capitalizations. Both actively
managed and passively invested portfolios may be utilized for
U.S. equity investments. Other assets such as real estate
funds, private equity funds, and hedge funds are currently used
for their diversification and return enhancing characteristics.
Derivatives may be used to reduce market exposure, however,
derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the
market value of the underlying investments. Investment risk is
measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly
investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and
periodic asset/liability studies.

We employ a building block approach in determining the long-term
rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied
and long-term historical relationships between equities and
fixed income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted
capital market principle that assets with higher volatility
generate a greater return over the long term. Current market
factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated
before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.
Proper consideration is also given to asset class
diversification and rebalancing as well as to the expected
returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan by each
category of plan assets. Peer data and historical returns are
reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

Following are the components of net periodic benefit cost for
our pension plans:

Net pension expense for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 reflects an
increase in service cost due to a reduction in the discount rate
and is impacted by the change in the amortization of actuarial
losses.

The unrecognized gains and losses in excess of 10% of the
projected benefit obligation are amortized over the average
remaining service life of participants. In addition, for the
unfunded plan, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses that
exceed 30% of the projected benefit obligation are fully
recognized in net periodic pension cost.

TJX also sponsors an employee savings plan under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for all
eligible U.S. employees. As of December 31, 2005 and
2004, assets under the plan totaled $567.6 million and
$504.7 million respectively, and are invested in a variety
of funds. Employees may contribute up to 50% of eligible pay.
TJX matches employee contributions, up to 5% of eligible pay, at
rates ranging from 25% to 50% based upon the Company’s
performance. TJX contributed $7.9 million in fiscal 2006,
$8.1 million in fiscal 2005 and $7.3 million in fiscal
2004 to the 401(k) plan. Employees cannot invest their
contributions in the TJX stock fund option in the 401(k) plan,
and may elect to invest up to only 50% of the Company’s
contribution in the TJX stock fund; the TJX stock fund has no
other trading restrictions. The TJX stock fund represents 3.5%,
4.3% and 4.5% of plan investments at December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

During fiscal 1999, TJX established a nonqualified savings plan
for certain U.S. employees. TJX matches employee
contributions at various rates which amounted to $313,000 in
fiscal 2006, $274,000 in fiscal 2005, and $226,000 in fiscal
2004. TJX transfers employee withholdings and the related
company match to a separate trust designated to fund the future
obligations. The trust assets, which are invested in a variety
of mutual funds, are included in other assets on the balance
sheets.

In addition to the plans described above, we also maintain
retirement/deferred savings plans for all eligible associates at
our foreign subsidiaries. We contributed for these plans
$3.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.3 million in
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Postretirement Medical:

TJX has an unfunded
postretirement medical plan that provides limited postretirement
medical and life insurance benefits to employees who participate
in our retirement plan and who retire at age 55 or older
with ten or more years of service. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2006, TJX eliminated this benefit for all active
associates and modified the benefit to current retirees enrolled
in the plan. The plan amendment replaces the previous medical
benefits with a defined amount (up to $35.00 per month)
that approximates the retirees cost of enrollment in the
Medicare Plan.

F-27


The valuation date for the plan is as of December 31 prior
to the fiscal year end date. Presented below is certain
financial information relating to the unfunded postretirement
medical plan for the fiscal years indicated:

The plan amendment results in a negative plan amendment of
$46.8 million which will be amortized into income over the
average remaining life (estimated at 12.6 years) of the
active participants. Medical inflation is no longer a factor in
determining the value of this obligation.

Notes K and L respectively.

K.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS RESERVE AND RELATED CONTINGENT
    LIABILITIES

We have a reserve for potential future obligations of
discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate
leases of former TJX businesses. The reserve reflects TJX’s
estimation of its cost for claims, updated quarterly, that have
been, or are likely to be, made against TJX for liability as an
original lessee or guarantor of the leases of these businesses,
after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. At
January 28, 2006, substantially all leases of discontinued
operations that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the
landlords asserted liability against TJX had been resolved.
Although TJX’s actual costs with respect to any of these
leases may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and TJX may
incur costs for leases from these discontinued operations that
were not terminated or had not expired, TJX does not expect to
incur any material costs related to discontinued operations in
excess of the reserve. The reserve balance amounted to
$15.0 million as of January 28, 2006,
$12.4 million as of January 29, 2005 and
$17.5 million as of January 31, 2004. During fiscal
2006, TJX received creditor recoveries of $8.5 million,
offset by equivalent additions to the reserve to reflect
adjustments to the reserve during the year. Any additional
creditor recoveries are expected to be immaterial.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 18 leases of
BJ’s Wholesale Club, another former TJX business, for which
BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for
discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because
we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX
with respect to these leases is remote due to the current
financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club.

L.

GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS

We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a
lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties
without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we
have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or
guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the
exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed
above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned
leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will
have a material adverse impact on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have
sufficient information about these leases to estimate our
potential contingent obligations under them.

We also have contingent obligations in connection with some
assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We
estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our
reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations,
BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed in Note K to the
consolidated financial statements, and properties of our
discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants
did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately
$100 million as of January 28, 2006. We believe that
most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to
TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for
substantially less due to mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which we may be
obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of
warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.

These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
respect to these contingent obligations.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS INFORMATION

The cash flows required to satisfy contingent obligations of the
discontinued operations as discussed in Note L, are
classified as a reduction in cash provided by continuing
operations. There are no remaining operating activities relating
to these operations.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store chains are managed on a
combined basis and are reported as the Marmaxx segment. The
Winners and HomeSense chains are also managed on a combined
basis and operate exclusively in Canada. T.K. Maxx operates in
the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Winners and T.K.
Maxx accounted for 19% of TJX’s net sales for fiscal 2006,
16% of segment profit and 20% of all consolidated assets. All of
our other store chains operate in the United States with the
exception of 14 stores operated in Puerto Rico by Marshalls
which include 7 HomeGoods locations in a “Marshalls
Mega Store” format. All of our stores, with the exception
of HomeGoods, HomeSense and Bob’s Stores sell apparel for
the entire family, including jewelry, accessories and footwear,
with a limited offering of giftware and home fashions. The
HomeGoods and HomeSense stores offer home fashions and home
furnishings. Bob’s Stores is a value-oriented retailer of
branded family apparel.

We evaluate the performance of our segments based on
“segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax
income before general corporate expense and interest.
“Segment profit or loss,” as defined by TJX, may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be
considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from
operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a
measure of liquidity.

SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)

Presented below is selected quarterly consolidated financial
data for fiscal 2006 and 2005 that was prepared on the same
basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and
includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein on a
consistent basis.

Gross earnings equal net sales less cost of sales, including
    buying and occupancy costs.

In November 2005, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
Payment” (SFAS 123(R)) using the modified
retrospective method which allows companies to adjust based on
the amounts previously recognized under SFAS 123 for
purposes of pro forma disclosures for all prior years
SFAS 123 was effective. Quarterly results in the table
above have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of this
statement. The effect of this change on quarterly net income and
related earnings per share in both fiscal 2006 and 2005 follow

The third quarter of fiscal 2006 includes the impact of certain
one-time events that reduced net income by approximately
$12 million, or $.02 per share. These third quarter
events included executive resignation agreements,

e-commerce

exit costs
and operating losses, and hurricane related costs including the
estimated impact of lost sales, partially offset by a gain from
a VISA/ MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement.

The fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 includes a $47 million
income tax benefit, or $.10 per share, due to the
repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings and a
$22 million tax benefit, or $.04 per share, relating
to the correction of the tax treatment of foreign currency gains
on certain intercompany loans. See note H to the
consolidated financial statements.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, TJX recorded a
one-time non-cash charge to conform its accounting policies with
generally accepted accounting principles related to the timing
of rent expense. This change resulted in a one-time, cumulative,
non-cash adjustment of $19.3 million after-tax, or
$.04 per share, which we recorded in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005. See note A at “Lease Accounting.”
